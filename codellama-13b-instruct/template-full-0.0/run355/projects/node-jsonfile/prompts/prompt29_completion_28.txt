  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` function is called with a different set of arguments. Specifically, the `null` value for the `replacer` parameter would cause the function to omit any properties that have a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment uses the `stringify` function without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` function is called with a different set of arguments. Specifically, the `4` value for the `space` parameter would cause the function to indent the output with four spaces, whereas the original code fragment uses the `stringify` function without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` function is called
