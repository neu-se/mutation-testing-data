  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which has a different output than `sin` for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the sine function from the `Math` library, which has a different output than `sin` for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(x + 1)` is the sine function applied to `x + 1`, which has a different output than `sin(x)` for the same input.

DONE.
