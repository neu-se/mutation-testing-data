  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would not be called, and the `sink` function would not be able to read from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which could cause the stream to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `true` as the first argument, which could cause the stream to behave differently.

DONE.
