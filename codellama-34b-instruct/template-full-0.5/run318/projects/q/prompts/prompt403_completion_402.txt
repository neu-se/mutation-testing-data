```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value, while `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that adds a fulfillment and rejection handler to a promise, while `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(null, reason => { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that adds a fulfillment and rejection handler to a promise, while `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason. The `null` argument is used to indicate that the promise should be resolved with
