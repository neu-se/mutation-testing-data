  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!cb` expression would always return `false`, even if the `cb` function was called with an error argument. In the original code, the `cb` function is only called with an error argument if the `ended` variable is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would always be called with `null` arguments, even if the `ended` variable is `true`. In the original code, the `cb` function is only called with `null` arguments if the `ended` variable is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would always be called with an error argument, even if the `ended` variable is `true`. In the original code, the `cb` function is only called with an
