  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` property is not defined on the `result` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isDone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isDone` property is not defined on the `result` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isResolved` property is not defined on the `result` object.

DONE.
