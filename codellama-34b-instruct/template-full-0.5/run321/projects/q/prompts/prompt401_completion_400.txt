  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which would change the behavior of the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `then` method with a different `this` context, which could affect the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `then` method with a different `this` context, which could affect the behavior of the method.

DONE.
