  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `undefined` is not an array, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the array. If the array is empty, the comparison would return `true`, otherwise it would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `undefined` is not an element in the array, so the comparison would always return `false`.

DONE.
