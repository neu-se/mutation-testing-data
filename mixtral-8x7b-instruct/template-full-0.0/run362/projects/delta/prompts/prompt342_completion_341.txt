 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek(1).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the second operation in the iterator instead of the next one, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data manipulation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to move forward, potentially skipping an operation, and then accesses the `insert` property, which may cause incorrect data manipulation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `retain` property instead of the `insert` property, potentially causing incorrect data manipulation or an error if the current operation is not an insertion.

DONE.
