  Sure, here are my three answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different pattern in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[\w-]+\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different pattern in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/(?!index)\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different pattern in the URL.

DONE.
