  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function returns a different line number than the original `captureLine` function, which could cause the filtering to be less effective or even create false positives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+ 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the `line` variable, regardless of whether it was 0 or not, which would cause the filtering to be less effective or even create false positives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const captureLine = (line) => line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `line` variable, regardless of whether it was 0 or not, which would cause the filtering to be less effective or even create false positives.

DONE.
