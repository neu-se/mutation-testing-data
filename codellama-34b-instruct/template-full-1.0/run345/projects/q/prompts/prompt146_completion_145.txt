  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`"__minimumStackCounter_"`
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of a single underscore at the end of the property name would create a new property instead of referring to the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`"_minimumStackCounter_"`
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of a single underscore at the beginning of the property name would create a new property instead of referring to the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`"_maximumStackCounter_"`
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of a different property name would allow the code to continue executing without encountering the `object_defineProperty` method.

DONE.
