  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would not be called, and the promise would not be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called with `null` as the argument, and the promise would be rejected with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called with an empty function as the argument, and the promise would be rejected with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
