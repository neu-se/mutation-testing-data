  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always return `true` for the `if` statement, while the new code fragment `0` would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always return `true` for the `if` statement, while the new code fragment `2` would always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always return `true` for the `if` statement, while the new code fragment `-1` would always return `false`.

DONE.
