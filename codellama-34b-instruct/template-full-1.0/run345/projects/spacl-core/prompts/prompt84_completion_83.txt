  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the new elements, whereas `map` returns a new array with the results of the function call for each element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with the elements of the original array that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` returns a new array with the results of the function call for each element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value by iterating over the elements of the original array and applying the function to each element, whereas `map` returns a new array with the results of the function call for each element in the original array.

DONE.
