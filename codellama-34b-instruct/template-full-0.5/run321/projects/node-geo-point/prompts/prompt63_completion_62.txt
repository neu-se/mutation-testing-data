  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `φ2` is dependent on `φ1`, and the replacement with `φ1` would cause the calculation to use the same value for both `φ1` and `φ2`, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `φ2` is dependent on `φ1`, and the replacement with `φ2 + 90` would cause the calculation to use a different value for `φ2`, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `φ2` is dependent on `φ1`, and the replacement with `Math.PI` would cause the calculation to use a constant value for `φ2`, leading to a different result.

DONE.
