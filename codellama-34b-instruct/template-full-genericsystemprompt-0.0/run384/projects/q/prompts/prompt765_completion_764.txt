  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("Buggy code");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Buggy code", which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Buggy code");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Buggy code", which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("Buggy code");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "Buggy code", which would trigger the fulfillment handler instead of the rejection
