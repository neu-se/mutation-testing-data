  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the function to return the incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be adding the real and imaginary parts together, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be subtracting the real part from the imaginary part, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
