  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` is not a valid method, so it would return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a valid method, but it would not return all resolved promises, only the first fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `settled` is not a valid method, so it would return an error.

DONE.
