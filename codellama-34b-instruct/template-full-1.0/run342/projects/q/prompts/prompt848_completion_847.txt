  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with the argument `true`, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with a different `this` context, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with a `null` `this` context, which could affect its behavior.

DONE.
