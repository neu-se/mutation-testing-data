 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { "value": false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of \_\_esModule to false, which could affect how the module is imported and used in other parts of the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "Complex", { "value": Complex, "writable": true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the Complex property writable, allowing it to be overwritten in other parts of the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "Complex", { "value": null });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the Complex property to null, which could cause errors in other parts of the application that rely on the Complex object.

DONE.
