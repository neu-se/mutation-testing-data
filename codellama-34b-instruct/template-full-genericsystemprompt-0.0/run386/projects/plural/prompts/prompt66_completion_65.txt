  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule with the same match and result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule with a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos', true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule with a different result and a third argument that would cause the rule to be applied in a different way.

DONE.
