  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, the `laterQueue` is used to store tasks that need to be executed later, and the order in which these tasks are executed may be important. By using `unshift` instead of `push`, the tasks would be executed in reverse order, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the program.
