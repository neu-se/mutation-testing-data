  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory in the archive, whereas the original code fragment only includes the contents of the `src` directory if the `recursive` option is set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, { recursive: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the contents of the `src` directory from the archive, whereas the original code fragment only excludes the contents of the `src` directory if the `recursive` option is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, { exclude: ['**/*.js'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude all files with a `.js` extension in the `src` directory and its subdirectories from the archive, whereas the original code fragment does not exclude any files based on their extension.

DONE.
