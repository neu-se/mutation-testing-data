  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(sinθ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` expects a value between -1 and 1, while `sinθ` can have a value greater than 1, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(cosθ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` expects a value between -1 and 1, while `cosθ` can have a value greater than 1, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(sinθ, cosθ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` expects two values, while `sinθ` and `cosθ` are a single value, leading to an error.

DONE.
