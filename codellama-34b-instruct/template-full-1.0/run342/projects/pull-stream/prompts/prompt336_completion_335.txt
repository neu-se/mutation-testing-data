  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` and `end` arguments are swapped, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` condition is negated, which could cause the program to enter the wrong branch of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? data : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator is used to return `data` if `end` is truthy, and `null` otherwise. This could cause the program to behave differently depending on the value of `end`.

DONE.
