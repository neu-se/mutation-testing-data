  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` has a higher precedence than the `+` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `Complex * (0 + 1)`, which is equal to `Complex * 1`, and therefore the output would be `Complex` instead of `Complex+1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used for concatenation when one of the operands is a string, so the expression would be evaluated as `'Complex' + 1`, which results in the string `'Complex1'` instead of the number `Complex+1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex + (1 ? 2 : 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional operator `? :` has a higher precedence than the `+` operator, so
