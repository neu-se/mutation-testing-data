 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the 're' part of the complex number with Infinity, whereas the original code fragment checks if either part is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the sum of the 're' and 'im' parts of the complex number with Infinity, whereas the original code fragment checks if either part is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / z['re']
