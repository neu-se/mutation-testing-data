Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the third argument to the first argument, potentially altering the expected input for the `pull` function and leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value being passed by adding 1 to the second argument, which could lead to unexpected results if the second argument is not intended to be a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected third argument with `null`, which could cause the `pull` function to behave incorrectly or throw an error if it relies on that argument being defined.

DONE.
