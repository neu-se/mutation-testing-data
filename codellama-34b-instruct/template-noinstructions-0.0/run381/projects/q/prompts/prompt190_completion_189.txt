  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first capture group of the regex instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the third capture group of the regex instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the fourth capture group of the regex instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect.

DONE.
