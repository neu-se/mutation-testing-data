  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `retDelta.chop()`, which removes any trailing retain ops from the delta, while the new code fragment would delete the first op in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `retDelta.chop()`, which removes any trailing retain ops from the delta, while the new code fragment would retain the first op in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(new Delta())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `retDelta.chop()`, which removes any trailing retain ops from the delta, while the new code fragment would add a new, empty delta to the end of the delta.

DONE.
