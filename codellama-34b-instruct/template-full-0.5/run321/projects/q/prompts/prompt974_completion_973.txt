  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nmapply` function expects an object as the first argument, but `undefined` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nmapply` function expects an object as the first argument, but `null` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nmapply` function expects an object as the first argument, but `1` is not an object.

DONE.
