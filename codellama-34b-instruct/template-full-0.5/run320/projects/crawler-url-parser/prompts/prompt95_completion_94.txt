  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://www.example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would use a different base URL than the one provided in the `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + "?query=param"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a URL with a query parameter, which would affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a null value instead of a base URL, which would cause it to use a different default value for the base URL.

DONE.
