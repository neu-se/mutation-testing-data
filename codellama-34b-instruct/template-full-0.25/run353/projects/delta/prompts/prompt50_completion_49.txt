  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which is used to determine the type of embed to use.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which is used to determine the type of embed to use.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which is used to determine the type of embed to use.

DONE.
