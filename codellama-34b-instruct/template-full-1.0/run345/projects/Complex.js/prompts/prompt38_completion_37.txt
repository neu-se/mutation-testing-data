  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an AND (`&&`) operation, while the new code fragment is an OR (`||`) operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 !== _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an AND (`&&`) operation, while the new code fragment is a XOR (`!==`) operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 ^ _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an AND (`&&`) operation, while the new code fragment is a bitwise XOR (`^`) operation.

DONE.
