  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = requestTick || flush;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ensure that the `requestTick` function is defined at the global scope, regardless of whether it was previously undefined or not. The `||` operator would return the first operand if it is defined and not nullish, and the second operand otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `setImmediate` function with `flush` as the first argument, and `requestTick` would be set to the return value of `setImmediate`. The `setImmediate` function schedules a function to be called at the end of the current JavaScript execution context, which is before the next system tick, if there is one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function() { flush(); };
```
This would result in different behavior
