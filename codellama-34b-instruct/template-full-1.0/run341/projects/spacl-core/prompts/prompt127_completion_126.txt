  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment Started the loop from index 0 (the first element), but this modified code fragment starts the loop from index 1 (the second element).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assumed a small positive integer value for `index`, but this modified code fragment causes `index` to be set to the largest possible integer value, which could lead to unexpected and different behavior in the subsequent loop body.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = -Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assumed a positive integer value for `index`, but this modified code fragment sets `index` to a negative infinite value, which could cause the loop to execute indefinitely or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
