  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` is an instance of `Promise`, which is not the same as checking if it is a thenable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` has a `then` method, which is not the same as checking if it is a thenable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` is an instance of `Promise`, which is not the same as checking if it is a thenable.

DONE.
