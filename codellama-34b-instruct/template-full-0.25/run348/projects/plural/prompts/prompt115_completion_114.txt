  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.push('new illness')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new element to the `illnesses` array, which is not intended in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `illnesses` array, which is not intended in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `illnesses` array, which is not intended in the original code.

DONE.
