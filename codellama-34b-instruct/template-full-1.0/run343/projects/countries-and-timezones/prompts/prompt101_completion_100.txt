  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if the timezone is deprecated, whereas the original code checks if it is not deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated || tzs[key].primary
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if the timezone is not deprecated or if it is the primary timezone, whereas the original code only checks if it is not deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated === false
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if the timezone is not deprecated, whereas the original code checks if it is not deprecated by using the negation operator.

DONE.
