  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `cb()` is a function call with no arguments.

DONE.
