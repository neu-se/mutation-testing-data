  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0 && b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `a` and `b` are `0`, while this new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` are non-zero. If `a` is non-zero while `b` is `0`, the original code would return `0`, while the new code would return `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `a` and `b` are `0`, while this new code fragment only checks if `b` is non-zero. If `a` is zero and `b` is non-zero, the original code would return `0`, while the new code would return `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) == 0 && Math.abs(b) == 0
