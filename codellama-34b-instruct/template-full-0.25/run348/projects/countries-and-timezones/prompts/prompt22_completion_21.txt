  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add an extra hour to the `dstOffset`, which would cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract an extra hour from the `dstOffset`, which would cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the `dstOffset`, which would cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be incorrect.

DONE.
