  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` returns a promise that is resolved with the argument, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the argument if it is a thenable or a promise, or the argument itself if it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved after a delay, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the argument, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the argument if it is a thenable or a promise, or the argument itself if it is not.

DONE.
