  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an empty object value.

DONE.
