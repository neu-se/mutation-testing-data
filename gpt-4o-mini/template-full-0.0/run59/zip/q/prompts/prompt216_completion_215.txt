Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of coercing the value into a promise, it would immediately reject the promise with the given value, leading to a promise that is always in a rejected state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return fulfill(value + " modified");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value by appending " modified" to it before fulfilling the promise, which changes the resolved value compared to the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the native Promise implementation to resolve the value, which may not handle non-promise values in the same way as the original `coerce` function, potentially leading to different promise states or behaviors.

DONE.
