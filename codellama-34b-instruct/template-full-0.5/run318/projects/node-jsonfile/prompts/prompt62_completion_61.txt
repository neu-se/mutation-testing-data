  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(0)` would return a new string that is a copy of the original string, whereas `content` would return the original string object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would return a new string that is the original string in uppercase, whereas `content` would return the original string object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('')` would return an array of single characters that make up the original string, whereas `content` would return the original string object.

DONE.
