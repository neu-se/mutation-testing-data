  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function() {
  throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with an array of promises, while the modified code fragment would reject the promise with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function() {
  return promises.filter(function(promise) {
    return promise.isFulfilled();
  });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with an array of promises, while the modified code fragment would resolve the promise with an array of only the fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function() {
