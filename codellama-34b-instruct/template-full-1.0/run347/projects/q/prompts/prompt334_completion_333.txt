  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `inspect`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `inspect` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is not a function, so the `()` operator would throw an error instead of returning the `state` property of `inspect`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.prototype` is not a function, so the `()` operator would throw an error instead of returning the `prototype` property of `inspect`.

DONE.
