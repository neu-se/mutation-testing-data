  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(min)` would always return 0, whereas `min` could be any integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil(min)` would always return 1, whereas `min` could be any integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(min)` would always return the absolute value of `min`, whereas `min` could be any integer.

DONE.
