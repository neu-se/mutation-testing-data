 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the string being passed to the bootstrap function is now "promises" instead of "promise". This change may cause the bootstrapping process to fail or behave unexpectedly, depending on how the `bootstrap` function is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value is being passed as the first argument to the bootstrap function instead of the expected string "promise". This change may cause the bootstrapping process to fail or behave unexpectedly, depending on how the `bootstrap` function is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
definition, "promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments passed to the bootstrap function has been changed. The `bootstrap` function may rely on the first argument being the library definition and the second argument being the string "p
