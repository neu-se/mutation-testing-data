  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` is the total number of operations in the iterator, while `this.peekLength()` is the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.offset` is the current offset within the current operation, while `this.peekLength()` is the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index].length` is the length of the current operation, while `this.peekLength()` is the length of the current operation minus the current offset.

DONE.
