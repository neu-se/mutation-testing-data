  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because at this point in the code, `a` has been defined as `Math.abs(x)`, so the code would be calculating the square root of `a * a` which would always result in `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the square root of `1 - a` which would always result in `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a-1)*(a+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the square root of `(a-1)*(a+1)` which would always result in `a-1`.

DONE.
