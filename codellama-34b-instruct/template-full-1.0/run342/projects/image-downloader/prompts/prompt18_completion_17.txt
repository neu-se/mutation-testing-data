  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the undecoded basename of the URL, rather than the decoded basename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, url.port
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the port number of the URL, rather than the pathname and basename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, pathname.replace(/[a-z]/ig, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any letters from the pathname, rather than using the undecoded basename.

DONE.
