  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true` initially, and the `!` operator would invert that value to `false`, causing the `trackRejection` function to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true` initially, and the `!==` operator would check if the value is not equal to `true`, which would evaluate to `false`. The `trackRejection` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true` initially, and the `===` operator would check if the value is equal to `false`, which
