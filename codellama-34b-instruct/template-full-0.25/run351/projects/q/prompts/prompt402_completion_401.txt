  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of throwing it, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the rejection reason instead of being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with the rejection reason as the message, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the new error instead of being rejected with the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q.reject(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the rejection reason instead of throwing it, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the rejection reason instead of being rejected with the original reason.

DONE.
