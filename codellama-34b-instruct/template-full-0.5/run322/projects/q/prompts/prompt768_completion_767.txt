  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop)` would create a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's fulfillment value or rejection reason, but with no callback function to handle the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Additionally, the `noop` function would be called with the rejection reason, which could potentially cause unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would
