 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new empty array, whereas the original code fragment reuses the `array` variable passed to the `spread` function. This could lead to issues if the original `array` variable is modified before the yielded promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the value of `this` in the context of the `spread` method, which might not be the expected array. The original code fragment explicitly passes the resolved array to the callback, ensuring the correct context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the keys of the `value` object instead of the resolved array. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the `fulfilled` callback, as it would receive an array of keys instead of the expected array of values.
