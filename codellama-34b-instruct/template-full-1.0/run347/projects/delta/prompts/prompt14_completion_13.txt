  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, in the same order as that provided by a `for...in` loop (the order of the properties is undefined and can vary across browsers). By calling `reverse()` on this array, the order of the property names is reversed, which can affect the behavior of the `reduce()` method used in the `compose()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. By calling `sort()` on the array of property names, we can change the order of the properties, which can affect the behavior of the `reduce()` method used in the `compose()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
