  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `void 0` are different values, and the callback would be called with a different first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` and `void 0` are different values, and the callback would be called with a different first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` and `void 0` are different values, and the callback would be called with a different second argument.

DONE.
