  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `pendingCount` variable that was not being updated when a promise was rejected. As a result, the `deferred.reject(rejection)` line would be executed multiple times, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `pendingCount` variable that was not being updated when a promise was rejected. As a result, the `deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress })` line would be executed multiple times, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `pendingCount` variable that was not being updated when a promise was rejected. As
