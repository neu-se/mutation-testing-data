  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the element is the last element in the array, while the modified code fragment is checking if the element is the second-to-last element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the element is the last element in the array, while the modified code fragment is checking if the element is the second-to-last element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the element is the last element in the array, while the modified code fragment is checking if the element is the second-to-last element in the array.

DONE.
