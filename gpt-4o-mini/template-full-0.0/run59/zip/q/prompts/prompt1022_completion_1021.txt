Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being dispatched from "post" to "get", which may not match the intended operation of invoking a method with a callback, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument "extraArg" to the array being dispatched, which could cause the receiving method to behave unexpectedly or throw an error due to an unexpected number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument to an empty array, effectively removing any arguments that were supposed to be passed to the method, which could lead to the method being called without the necessary parameters.

DONE.
