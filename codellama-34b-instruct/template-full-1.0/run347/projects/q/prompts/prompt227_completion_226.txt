  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in the message array always being pushed, even if the promise has been resolved. This would cause the promise to never be resolved and would result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in the message array never being pushed, which would allow the promise to be resolved. However, this would also remove the ability to retrieve the value of the resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in the message array only being pushed if it has a length greater than 0. This would allow the promise to be resolved and would also ensure that the promise's value is not overwritten with an empty array.

DONE.
