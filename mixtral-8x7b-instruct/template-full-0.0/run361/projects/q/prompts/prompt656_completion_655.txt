 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a built-in object that provides access to the arguments passed to a function, while `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of an array would cause the `array_reduce` function to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve([])` creates a new promise that is resolved with an empty array, which would cause the `array_reduce` function to skip processing any elements in the input array.

DONE.
