  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value of `op.retain` is `null` or not, while this replacement checks if the value is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value of `op.retain` is not `null`, while this replacement checks if the value is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value of `op.retain` is not `null`, while this replacement checks if the value is equal to `null`.

DONE.
