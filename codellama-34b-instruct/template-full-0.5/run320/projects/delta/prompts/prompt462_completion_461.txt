  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `rest` except the first one, whereas `rest` returns a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.splice(1)` would remove the first element of `rest` and return a new array containing the remaining elements, whereas `rest` returns a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(0, 1)` would return a new array containing the first element of `rest`, whereas `rest` returns a reference to the original array.

DONE.
