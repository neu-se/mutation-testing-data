  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes and returns a portion of the array, whereas `delete` only removes the key without returning anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes and returns the first element of the array, whereas `delete` only removes the key without returning anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of the array, whereas `delete` only removes the key without returning anything.

DONE.
