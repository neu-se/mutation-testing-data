Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(',').slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter from '/' to ',', causing the path segments to be split incorrectly, which may lead to malformed regex generation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').map(part => part.trim())
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a trimming operation on each segment, which could alter the expected path structure and potentially allow for invalid paths to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').filter(part => part.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out empty segments, which could lead to a valid regex being generated even when the original path specification contained empty segments, thus bypassing the error check for empty segments.

DONE.
