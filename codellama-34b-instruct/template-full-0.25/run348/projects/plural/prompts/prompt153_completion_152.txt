  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length, num
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` would return the length of the string, rather than the string itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `num` would be passed as the first argument to the `plural` function, rather than the second argument, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `num + 1` would be passed as the first argument to the `plural` function, rather than `num`, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
