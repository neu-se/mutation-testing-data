Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value from an empty array to an array containing a single `null` value, which could affect any subsequent operations expecting an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of an empty array would lead to errors in code that expects an array, as it would not have the array methods available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["unexpected"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value to an array containing a string "unexpected", which could lead to incorrect assumptions or errors in any code that processes the keys of the promised object.

DONE.
