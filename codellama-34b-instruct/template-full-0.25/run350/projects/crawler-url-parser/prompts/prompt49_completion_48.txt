  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl) + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the base URL and the path of the current URL, which would result in a different URL than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl) + parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the base URL and the pathname of the current URL, which would result in a different URL than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl) + parsedUrl.pathname + parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the base URL, the pathname, and the search query of the current URL, which would result in a different URL than the original code.

DONE.
