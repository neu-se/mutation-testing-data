  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.reject` would always reject the promise, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.resolve` would always resolve the promise, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.notify(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.notify` would always notify the promise, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
