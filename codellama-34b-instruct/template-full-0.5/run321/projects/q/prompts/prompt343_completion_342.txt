  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with the fulfilled value, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the fulfilled value, but it would not be passed to the `fulfilled` function, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, which would be caught and passed to the `rejected` function, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
