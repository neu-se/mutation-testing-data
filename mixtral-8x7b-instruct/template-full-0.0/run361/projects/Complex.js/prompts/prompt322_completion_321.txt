 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the real part of the complex number, instead of the original variable 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the result with a constant value, making it unrelated to the original input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness to the result, making it unpredictable and inconsistent.

DONE.
