  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to be rotated is multiplied by twice the angle, instead of the angle, as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to be rotated is added to the angle, instead of multiplying it, as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.Max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to be rotated is set to the maximum of the two angles, instead of multiplying them, as expected.

DONE.
