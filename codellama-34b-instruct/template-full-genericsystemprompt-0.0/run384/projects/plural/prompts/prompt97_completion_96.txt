  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is also different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is also different.
