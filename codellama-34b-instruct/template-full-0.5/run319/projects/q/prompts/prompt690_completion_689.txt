  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments object to the `array_slice` function, rather than the `arguments` object, which would result in a different array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments object to the `array_slice` function, starting from the second element, rather than the first element, which would result in a different array being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments object to the `array_slice` function, starting from the third element, rather than the first element, which would result in a different array being returned.

DONE.
