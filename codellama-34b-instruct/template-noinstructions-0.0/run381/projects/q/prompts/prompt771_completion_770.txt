  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `all` and `allSettled` are different methods in the Q library, and they have different behavior when it comes to handling rejected promises. `all` will reject the promise as soon as any of the input promises are rejected, while `allSettled` will wait for all promises to settle before resolving the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Q(promises).allResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `
