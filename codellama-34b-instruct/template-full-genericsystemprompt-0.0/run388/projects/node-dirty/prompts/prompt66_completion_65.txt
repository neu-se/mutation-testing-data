  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would immediately close the write stream, whereas `destroy()` would only close the stream after all data has been written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would close the stream with an error, whereas `end()` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('Test data')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` would write data to the stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` would not.

DONE.
