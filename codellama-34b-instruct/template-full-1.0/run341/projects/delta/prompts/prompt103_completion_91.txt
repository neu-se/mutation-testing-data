  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(function(op) { return op + 1; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to each element in the array, causing the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(function(op) { return op % 2 === 0; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include elements in the array that are even numbers, causing the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(function(op) { console.log(op); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log each element in the array to the console, rather than returning a new array with the same elements, causing the test suite to fail.

DONE.
