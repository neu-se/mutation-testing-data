  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `chop()` method on the `delta` object, while this new code fragment calls the `chop()` method on the result of `concat(rest)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `chop()` method, which removes all attributes and embeds from the delta, while this new code fragment calls the `delete()` method, which removes a specific number of characters from the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `chop()` method, which removes all attributes and embeds from the delta, while this new code fragment calls the `retain()` method, which retains a specific number of characters in the
