  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero'](0))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not being called with the correct argument. The original code fragment called `isZero` with `this['im']`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. However, in this option, `isZero` is being called with `0`, which is a real number. This would cause the `isZero` method to return `false` even if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, leading to incorrect behavior in the `div` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero'](1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with the wrong argument. The original code fragment called `isZero` with `this['im']`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. However, in this option, `isZero` is
