  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would not pass the array of arguments as a single argument to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the array of arguments starting from the second element, instead of from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat([1, 2, 3])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the array of arguments concatenated with the array [1, 2, 3], instead of just the array of arguments.

DONE.
