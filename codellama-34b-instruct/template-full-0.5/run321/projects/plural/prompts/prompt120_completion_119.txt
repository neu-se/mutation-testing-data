  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toLowerCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function returns the word as is, while this new function would return the word in lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function returns the word as is, while this new function would return the word in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function returns the word as is, while this new function would return the word with its characters reversed.

DONE.
