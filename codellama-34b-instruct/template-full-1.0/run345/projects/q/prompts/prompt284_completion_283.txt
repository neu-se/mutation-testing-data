  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that would reject the promise with the given reason, whereas `resolve` is a function that would resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"something else"
```
This would result in different behavior because "something else" is a string literal that does not refer to any variable or function, and would thus return an error when `progressListener(progress)` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null value that does not refer to any object, and would thus return `undefined` when `progressListener(progress)` is called.

DONE.
