  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that queues a function to be executed after the current call stack has cleared, while `setTimeout` is a function that queues a function to be executed after a specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` with a delay of 1 millisecond would execute the `flush` function after the current call stack has cleared, while `setImmediate` would execute the `flush` function immediately after the current call stack has cleared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve().then(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve().then(flush)` would execute the `flush` function asynchronously, while `setImmediate` and `setTimeout` would execute the `flush` function synchronously.

DONE.
