 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjusted longitude value would be decreased by 1, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to be in a different location than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjusted longitude value would be randomly generated, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to be in a completely different location than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'not a number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjusted longitude value would be a string, which would cause an error when trying to create a new GeoPoint.

DONE.
