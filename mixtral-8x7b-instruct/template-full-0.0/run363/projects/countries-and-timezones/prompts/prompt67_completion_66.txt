 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would now return the `options.country` instead of the actual country object. This could cause issues if the `options.country` is `undefined` or a different object than the expected country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now tries to access a non-existent property in the `countries` object. This would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return `undefined` instead of the actual country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id].name
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now returns the `name` property of the country object instead of the entire country object. This could cause issues if other parts of the codebase rely on the full country object and not just its name.

DONE.
