Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly resolve the promise with the reason instead of rejecting it, leading to a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill the promise with the reason instead of rejecting it, which is not the intended behavior for a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected, but it would not properly handle the rejection in the context of the original promise, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
