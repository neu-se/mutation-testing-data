  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `a` is not the same as the variable `b` that is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `NULL` is not the same as the variable `b` that is used in the original code fragment, and it is also not a valid JavaScript variable name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `undefined` is not the same as the variable `b` that is used in the original code fragment, and it is also not a valid JavaScript variable name.

DONE.
