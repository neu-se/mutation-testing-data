  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `errback` is a function that handles errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is a function that handles success, whereas `errback` is a function that handles errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of handling it.

DONE.
