  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `cos(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad)`. This would result in different behavior because `cos(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad)` is always positive, while `point2Rad` is signed, so the sign of the result would change in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `sin(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad)`. This would result in different behavior because `sin(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad)` is always positive, while `point2Rad` is signed, so the sign of the result would change in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `+cos(point2Rad)`. This would result in different behavior because `+cos(point2Rad)` is always positive, while `point2Rad` is signed, so the sign of the result would change in some cases.

DONE.
