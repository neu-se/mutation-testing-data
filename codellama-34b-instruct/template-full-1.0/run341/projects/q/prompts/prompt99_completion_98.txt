  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (;index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate indefinitely, throwing a maximum call stack size exceeded error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate indefinitely, causing an endless loop that blocks the event loop and hangs the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run only once, ignoring the remaining iterations.

DONE.
