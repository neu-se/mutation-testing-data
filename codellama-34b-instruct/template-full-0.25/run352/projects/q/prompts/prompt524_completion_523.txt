  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may not be defined in the current scope. Replacing it with `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may not be defined in the current scope. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may not be defined in the current scope. Replacing it with an empty object would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
