  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes a capturing group for the line number, which would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the regular expression matches the input string, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` method returns the index of the first match, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

DONE.
