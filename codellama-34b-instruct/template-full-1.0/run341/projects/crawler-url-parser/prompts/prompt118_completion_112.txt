  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the value of `currentUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, regardless of the value of `currentUrl`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to null, regardless of the value of `currentUrl`.

DONE.
