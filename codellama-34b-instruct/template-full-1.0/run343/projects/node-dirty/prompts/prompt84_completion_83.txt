  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\r
```
This would result in different behavior because `\r` is a carriage return character, which is different from the newline character `\n` that was originally used. This change would cause the `readStream` to terminate each line at a different position, potentially resulting in data corruption or inconsistencies in the stored values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\t
```
This would result in different behavior because `\t` is a tab character, which is different from the newline character `\n` that was originally used. This change would cause the `readStream` to terminate each line at a different position, potentially resulting in data corruption or inconsistencies in the stored values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\u0000
```
This would result in different behavior because `\u0000` is the Unicode code point for the NULL character, which is different from the newline character `\n` that was originally used. This change would cause the `
