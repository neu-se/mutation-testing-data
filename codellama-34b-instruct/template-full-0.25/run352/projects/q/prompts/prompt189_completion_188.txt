  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a string instead of a number, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they are internal frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `null` for all stack lines, even if they are internal frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined` for all stack lines, even if they are internal frames.

DONE.
