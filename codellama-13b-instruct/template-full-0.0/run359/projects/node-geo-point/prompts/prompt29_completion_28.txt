  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values of the second point are swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values of the first point are swapped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the latitude and longitude of the second point is randomized.

DONE.
