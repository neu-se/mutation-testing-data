  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to be called on the `Policy` instance, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `Policy` instance with no arguments, which would cause an error if the method expects arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `Policy` instance with the correct arguments, but it would still cause the method to be called on the wrong object and with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
