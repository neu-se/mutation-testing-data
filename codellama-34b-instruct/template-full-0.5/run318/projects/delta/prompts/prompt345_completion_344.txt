  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData, opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.invert` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.invert` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment passes only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.invert` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment passes the arguments in the reverse order.

DONE.
