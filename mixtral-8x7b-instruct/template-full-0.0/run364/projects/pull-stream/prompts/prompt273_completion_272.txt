 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null equality instead of checking if the value is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.constructor.name !== 'Function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the constructor name instead of using the 'typeof' operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream.hasOwnProperty('constructor') || stream.constructor.name !== 'Function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it also checks if the 'constructor' property exists, which could be the case for objects created using object literals or other constructors.

DONE.
