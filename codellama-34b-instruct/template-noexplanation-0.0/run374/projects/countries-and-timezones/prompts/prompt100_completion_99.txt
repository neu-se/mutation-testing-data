  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This code fragment will return an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object, which is the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This code fragment will return an array of values representing the values of the `tzs` object, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(tzs)
```
This code fragment will return an array of key-value pairs representing the entries of the `tzs` object, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
