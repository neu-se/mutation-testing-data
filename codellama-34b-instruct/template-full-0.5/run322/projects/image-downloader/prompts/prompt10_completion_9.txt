  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the value of `options.dest`, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the value of `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of `options.dest` to uppercase, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the case of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the directory name of the value of `options.dest`, whereas the original code fragment would return the full path of the file including the filename.

DONE.
