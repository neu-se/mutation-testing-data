Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to the `pull` function from the second element of the `ref` array to the first element, potentially altering the intended behavior of the function when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected second argument with `undefined`, which may lead to unexpected results or errors in the `pull` function, as it would not be passing a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected second argument with `null`, which could cause the function to behave differently, especially if the subsequent logic relies on the presence of a valid argument.

DONE.
