  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `src` string with an empty string, which would change the type of the expression from a string to a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `src` string, which could be different from the original value of `src`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the uppercase version of the `src` string, which could be different from the original value of `src`.

DONE.
