  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex.ZERO;
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would always return zero, regardless of the inputs, which would cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex.ONE;
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would always return one, regardless of the inputs, which would cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would return a reference to the current instance, regardless of the inputs, which would cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
