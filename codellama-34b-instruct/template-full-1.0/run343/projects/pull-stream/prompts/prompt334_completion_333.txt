  Sure, here are three options for replacing the `end` statement in the `through` function with a buggy code fragment:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called twice, once with `end` and once with `data`, which could potentially cause a callback to be called twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with `undefined` instead of `end`, which could potentially cause the callback to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with `null` instead of `end`, which could potentially cause the callback to be called with the wrong argument.

DONE.
