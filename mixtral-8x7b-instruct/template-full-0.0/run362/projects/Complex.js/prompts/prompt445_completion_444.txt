 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places
```
This would result in different behavior because the default value of 10 is not used when `places` is provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a base of 2 instead of 10, potentially changing the rounding behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it squares the `places` value instead of raising 10 to the power of `places`.

DONE.
