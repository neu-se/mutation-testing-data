  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the iterator has no more elements, while the new code fragment is checking if the iterator has more elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the iterator has no more elements, while the new code fragment is checking if the iterator is at the last element of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index === this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the iterator has no more elements, while the new code fragment is checking if the iterator is at the end of the `ops` array.

DONE.
