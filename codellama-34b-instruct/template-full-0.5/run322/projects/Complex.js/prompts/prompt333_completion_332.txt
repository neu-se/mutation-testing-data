  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with -1, while this new code checks for equality with 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with -1, while this new code checks for equality with Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with -1, while this new code checks for inequality with 0.

DONE.
