  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` would return `null` instead of a string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.someNonExistentProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` would throw an error if the property does not exist on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.someProperty = 'someValue'
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` would include the new property and its value in the resulting string.

DONE.
