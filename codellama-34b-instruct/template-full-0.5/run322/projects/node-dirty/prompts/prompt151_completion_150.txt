  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err` is passed as an argument to the callback function, but `null` would not be passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err` is passed as an argument to the callback function, but `undefined` would not be passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err` is passed as an argument to the callback function, but `new Error()` would create a new error object and pass it as an argument.

DONE.
