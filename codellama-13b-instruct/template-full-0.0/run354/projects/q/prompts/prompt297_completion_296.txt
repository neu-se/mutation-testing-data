  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return `x` instead of `y`, which is the value that the `race` method is expecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return `undefined` instead of `y`, which is the value that the `race` method is expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return `null` instead of `y`, which is the value that the `race` method is expecting.

DONE.
