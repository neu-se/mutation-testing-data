  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(atReport, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would prevent the `rejectionHandled` event from being emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(atReport, 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the promise at the specified index with the value `1`, which would cause the `rejectionHandled` event to be emitted with the wrong promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(atReport, 1, atReport);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the promise at the specified index with the value `atReport`, which would cause the `rejectionHandled` event to be emitted with the wrong promise
