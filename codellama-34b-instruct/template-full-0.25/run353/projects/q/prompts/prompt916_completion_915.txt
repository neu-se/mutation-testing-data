  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than resolving it with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with a message, rather than being resolved or rejected.

DONE.
