  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "at " prefix from the stack line, which is used to identify the function name and file location in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the file location and function name from the stack line, which is used to identify the location of the error in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the function name and file location from the stack line, which is used to identify the location of the error in the code.

DONE.
