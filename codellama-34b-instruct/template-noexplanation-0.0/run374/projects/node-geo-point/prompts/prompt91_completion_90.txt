  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This modification will cause the bearing calculation to be off by 180 degrees, which is a significant difference in the context of geographic coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This modification will cause the bearing calculation to be double the actual value, which will result in a significant error in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 90
```
This modification will cause the bearing calculation to be off by 90 degrees, which is a significant difference in the context of geographic coordinates.

DONE.
