  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` returns a timezone object, while `getCountry` returns a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` option is set to `true`, which would return a different set of countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allTimezones` option is set to `true`, which would return a different set of timezones.

DONE.
