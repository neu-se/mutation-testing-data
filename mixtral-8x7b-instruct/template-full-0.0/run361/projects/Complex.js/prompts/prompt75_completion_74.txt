 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` as a block-scoped variable using `let` instead of using the global `var` keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
const i = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` as a constant using `const` instead of using the global `var` keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window.i = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the value to the global `window` object, which can be accessed from other parts of the code, potentially causing unexpected side effects.

DONE.
