  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is a function that returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, whereas `cosh` is a missing function in the context of the given code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(1 - 1 / c^2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the difference of 1 and the reciprocal of `c^2`, whereas `cosh(a) + Math.cos(b)` calculates the sum of the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and the cosine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the function for computing the arccosine of a number, whereas `atanh` is the function for computing the hyperbolic arctangent of a number.

DONE.
