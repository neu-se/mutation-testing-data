  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is not being checked before calling the `cb` function. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with an incorrect value for the `ended` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is being checked before calling the `cb` function. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with the correct value for the `ended` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is being checked before calling the `cb` function, but the `cb` function is being called with a different value for the `ended` parameter. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with an incorrect value for the `ended` parameter.

DONE.
