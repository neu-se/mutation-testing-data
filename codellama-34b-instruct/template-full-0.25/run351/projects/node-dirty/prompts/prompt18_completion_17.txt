  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `cbs` is a reference to the original array. If the test case relies on the original array being modified, it would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.concat([])` creates a new array by concatenating `cbs` with an empty array, whereas `cbs` is a reference to the original array. If the test case relies on the original array being modified, it would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(Boolean)` creates a new array by filtering out falsy values from `cbs`, whereas `cbs` is a reference to the original array. If the test case relies on the original array being
