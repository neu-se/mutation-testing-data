  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `!hasStacks || !promise.stack || error !== Object(error) || error === null ||  error.stack` 
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the specified variables are truthy, while the new code checks if they are falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `!hasStacks && !promise.stack && typeof error !== "object" && error !== null && !error.stack` 
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if all the specified variables are truthy, while the new code checks if they are all falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `hasStacks || promise.stack || error === Object(error) || error === null || !error.stack` 
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if any of the specified variables is falsy, while the new code checks if all of them are truthy.

DONE.
