  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, so the original code would always execute the `onRejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `onFulfilled` function if there was only one promise in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `onFulfilled` function if the array was not empty.

DONE.
