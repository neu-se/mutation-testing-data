  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a reference to the `then` method of the promise, which is not the same as `this.all`, which is a reference to the `all` method of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` is a reference to the `catch` method of the promise, which is not the same as `this.all`, which is a reference to the `all` method of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.finally` is a reference to the `finally` method of the promise, which is not the same as `this.all`, which is a reference to the `all` method of the promise.

DONE.
