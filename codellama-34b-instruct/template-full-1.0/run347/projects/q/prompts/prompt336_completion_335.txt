  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function on the result of calling `inspect` on the `promise` object, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(inspect({state: "rejected"}));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `state` property to "rejected", regardless of the actual state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect({state: "rejected"})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `state` property to "rejected", regardless of the actual state of the promise, and it would not call the `inspect` function on the `promise` object.

DONE.
