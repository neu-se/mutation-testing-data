Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends data to the destination file instead of overwriting it, which could lead to unexpected results if the file already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest)).on('finish', () => resolve({ filename: 'unknown' }));
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves with a hardcoded filename 'unknown' instead of the actual destination filename, which could confuse the caller about where the data was written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest)).on('close', () => reject(new Error('Stream closed unexpectedly')));
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with an error when the stream closes, instead of resolving it, which would prevent successful completion of the operation.

DONE.
