Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `null` to each country instead of the actual country object, leading to incorrect data being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, {}) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `getCountry` with an empty options object instead of the provided `options`, potentially altering the output based on the default behavior of `getCountry`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options) || {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object if `getCountry` returns a falsy value (like `null`), which changes the expected output from potentially `null` to an empty object.

DONE.
