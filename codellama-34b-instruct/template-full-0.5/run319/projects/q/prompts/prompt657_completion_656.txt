  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the second element, instead of starting from the first element as in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the first element, but would only include the first element (i.e., the function's `this` binding) in the resulting array, instead of including all the elements as in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the second element, but would only include the second element in the resulting array, instead of including all the elements starting from the second element as in the original code fragment.
