  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`. If `end` is a truthy value other than `true`, such as a non-empty string or a non-zero number, the original code fragment would execute the `cb(end === true ? null : end)` line, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is not strictly equal to `true`. If `end` is a truthy value other than `true`, such as a non-empty string or a non-zero number, the original code fragment would execute the `cb(end === true ? null : end)` line, while this new code fragment would execute the `acc = data; sink(source)` line.
