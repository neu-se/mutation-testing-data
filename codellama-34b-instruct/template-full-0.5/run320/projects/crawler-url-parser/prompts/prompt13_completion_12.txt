  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches URLs that start with `//`, while the new one matches URLs that start with `http://` or `https://`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches URLs that start with `//`, while the new one matches URLs that start with `http://` or `https://`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches URLs that start with `//`, while the new one matches URLs that start with `ftp://`.

DONE.
