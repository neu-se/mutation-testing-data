 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the result for the case when the base is fully imaginary would always be a complex number with a real part of 0, regardless of the exponent's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result for the case when the base is fully imaginary would always be a complex number with a real part of 1, regardless of the exponent's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result for the case when the base is fully imaginary would always be the same as the base's real part, regardless of the exponent's value.

DONE.
