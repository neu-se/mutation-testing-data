  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value 42, regardless of the actual value of `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "hello", rather than the actual value of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, rather than the actual value of `args`.

DONE.
