  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the other iterator instead of the this iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss or double-count certain operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null value into the ops array, which is not a valid operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the next operation from the this iterator without advancing it, potentially causing the algorithm to miss or double-count certain operations.

DONE.
