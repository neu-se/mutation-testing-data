  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is reversed, so it would replace "e" with "a" instead of "a" with "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'o') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is different, so it would replace "a" with "o" instead of "a" with "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'i') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is different, so it would replace "a" with "i" instead of "a" with "e".

DONE.
