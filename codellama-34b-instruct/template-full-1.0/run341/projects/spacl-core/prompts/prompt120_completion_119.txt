  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx` is a parameter of the `query` method, and `null` is not a valid value for that parameter. Using `null` would cause the `matches` method to throw an error, which would result in the rule always being considered non-matching, effectively disabling the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `ctx` parameter of the `query` method. Using `undefined` would cause the `matches` method to throw an error, which would result in the rule always being considered non-matching, effectively disabling the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid value for the `ctx` parameter of the `query` method. Using `<PLACEHOLDER>`
