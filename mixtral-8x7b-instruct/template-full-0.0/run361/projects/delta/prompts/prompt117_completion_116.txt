 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the `insert` property of `elem` by 1, which is unnecessary and doesn't change the behavior of the original code. However, if `elem.insert` is a getter function, this change would result in different behavior since it now accesses the property value instead of invoking the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
elem['insert']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `insert` property of `elem` using bracket notation instead of dot notation. If there is a custom getter or setter for the `insert` property, this change could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
elem.delete || elem.insert
