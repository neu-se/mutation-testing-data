  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` and `next` are different methods in the `OpIterator` class. While `peek` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, `next` returns the next operation and advances the iterator. Using `peek` instead of `next` in the buggy code fragment would cause the iterator to stay in the same position, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` and `thisIter` are different iterators. While `thisIter` iterates over the operations in the original delta, `otherIter` iterates over the operations in the other delta. Using `otherIter.next()` would cause the iteration to advance in the other delta, rather than the original delta, resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
