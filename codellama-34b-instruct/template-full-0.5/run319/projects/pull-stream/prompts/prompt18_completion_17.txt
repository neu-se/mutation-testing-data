  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is being incremented by 1, which would change the value of the variable and potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is being decremented by 1, which would change the value of the variable and potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is being multiplied by 2, which would change the value of the variable and potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
