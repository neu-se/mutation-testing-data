  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the `reason` argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called with the `reason` argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called with the `reason` argument, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
