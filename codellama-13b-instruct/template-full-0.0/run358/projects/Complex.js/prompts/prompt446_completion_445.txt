  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or halfway to an even integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or halfway to an even integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.trunc` function rounds towards zero, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or halfway to an even integer.

DONE.
