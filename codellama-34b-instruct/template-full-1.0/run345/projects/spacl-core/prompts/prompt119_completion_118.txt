  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `path` string to uppercase, which could cause the `path.match()` method to fail if the regular expression is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating the `path` string with `'foo'` would change the value of the `path` variable, which could affect the outcome of the `path.match()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `path[1]` would return the second character of the `path` string, which could cause the regular expression to fail if it is expecting the first character to be a specific value.

DONE.
