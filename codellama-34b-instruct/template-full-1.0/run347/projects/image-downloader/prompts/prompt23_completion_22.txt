  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join()` function to return the current working directory instead of the actual path to the destination file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join()` function to return the current working directory instead of the actual path to the destination file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join()` function to return a path that is relative to the current file instead of the actual path to the destination file.

DONE.
