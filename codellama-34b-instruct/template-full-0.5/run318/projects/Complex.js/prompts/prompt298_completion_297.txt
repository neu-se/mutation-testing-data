  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add an extra `1` to the value of `b`, which would cause the `sinh` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of `b`, which would cause the `sinh` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract `1` from the value of `b`, which would cause the `sinh` function to return a different value.

DONE.
