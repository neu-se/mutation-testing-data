  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the modified code increments it by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the modified code decrements it by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `i` to index into the `ops` array, while the modified code uses `j`.

DONE.
