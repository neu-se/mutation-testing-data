  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with the incorrect number of items in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Simulated error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted with a simulated error, whereas the original code would not emit any error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_close` event would be emitted even if the write stream is not actually closed, whereas the original code would not emit this event until the write stream is actually closed.

DONE.
