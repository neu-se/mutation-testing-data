  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the operation name "get" instead of "post", which could cause the method to return a different value or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the operation name "set" instead of "post", which could cause the method to return a different value or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the operation name "delete" instead of "post", which could cause the method to return a different value or throw an error.

DONE.
