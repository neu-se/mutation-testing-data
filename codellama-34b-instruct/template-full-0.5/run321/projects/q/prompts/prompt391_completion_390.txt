  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called when the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called when the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with an empty object instead of the actual value.

DONE.
