  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an empty string, while the new code fragment would return null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an empty string, while the new code fragment would return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 'abc';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an empty string, while the new code fragment would return the string 'abc'.

DONE.
