  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` executes a provided function once per element in the array, whereas `reduce` produces a new array or a value other than an array from an initial array and an accumulator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function, whereas `reduce` performs a reduction of the array and returns a value other than an array or a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` extracts a section of an array and returns a new array, whereas `reduce` performs a reduction of the array and returns a value other than an array or a new array.

DONE.
