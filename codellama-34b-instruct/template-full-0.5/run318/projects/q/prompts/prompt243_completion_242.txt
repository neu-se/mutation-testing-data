  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and `undefined` is a primitive value. The `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the two operands must be of the same type and have the same value. In this case, `resolvedPromise` is an object, and `undefined` is a primitive, so they will never be strictly equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and `null` is a primitive value. The `==` operator checks for loose equality, which means that the two operands are converted to the same type before comparison. In this case, `resolvedPromise` is an object, and `null` is a primitive, so they will never be loosely equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
