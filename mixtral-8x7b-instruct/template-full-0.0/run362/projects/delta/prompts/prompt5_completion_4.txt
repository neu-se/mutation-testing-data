 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes[key] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would keep keys with undefined values instead of removing them, which is the original purpose of the `keepNull` flag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delete attributes[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove keys with null values, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
keepNull && attributes[key] === null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would keep keys with null values only if `keepNull` is true, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in detecting unintended behavior and potential bugs in the code. DONE.
