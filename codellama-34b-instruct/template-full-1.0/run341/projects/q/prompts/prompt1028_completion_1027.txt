  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    nodeback(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the result value to the nodeback function instead of passing `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    nodeback();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the nodeback function with no arguments instead of passing `null` as the first argument and the result value as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    nodeback.(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the nodeback function with the result value as the first argument instead of passing `null` as the first argument.

DONE.
