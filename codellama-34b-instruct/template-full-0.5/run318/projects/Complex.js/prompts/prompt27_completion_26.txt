  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the error message to be different, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the error message to be different, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ '1'` would cause the error message to be different, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
