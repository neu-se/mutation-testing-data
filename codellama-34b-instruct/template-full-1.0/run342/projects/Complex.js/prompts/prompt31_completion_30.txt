  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the result of the `logHypot` function by a factor of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root operation would change the result of the `logHypot` function by a factor of 0.5.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function would convert the value of `b` to a number, which could change the result of the `logHypot` function if `b` is not already a number.

DONE.
