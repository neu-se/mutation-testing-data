  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid number and will likely cause an error in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY
```
This would result in different behavior because `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is a special value that represents a number that is larger than any other number, and will likely cause an error in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid number but a very small distance, and will likely cause an error in the calculation.

DONE.
