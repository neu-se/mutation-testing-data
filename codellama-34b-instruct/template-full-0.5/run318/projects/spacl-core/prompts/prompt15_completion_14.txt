  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, whereas `match` returns the matched substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').length
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, and `length` returns the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a substring starting from the specified index, whereas `match` returns the matched substring.

DONE.
