  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string on forward slashes, which could produce a different array of strings than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(/\//g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string on forward slashes and also remove any empty strings from the resulting array, which could produce a different array of strings than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(/\./g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string on periods, which could produce a different array of strings than the original code.

DONE.
