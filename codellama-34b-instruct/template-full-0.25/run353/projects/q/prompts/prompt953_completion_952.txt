  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the function call is successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the result of the function call, rather than the `fail` method being called on the promise returned by `fapply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then`
