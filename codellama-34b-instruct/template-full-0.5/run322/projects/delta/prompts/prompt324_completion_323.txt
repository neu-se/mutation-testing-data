  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the base index, which would cause the slice to start at a different position than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the length to the base index, which would cause the slice to start at a different position than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the base index, which would cause the slice to start at a different position than the original code.

DONE.
