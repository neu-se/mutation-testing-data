  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this replacement only checks for the presence of the string "http".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes('://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this replacement only checks for the presence of the "://" substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match(/^(?!localhost)\w+:/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this replacement only checks for the presence of a word character followed by a colon, excluding the string "localhost".

DONE.
