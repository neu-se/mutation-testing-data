  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.retain;
const otherData = otherOp.retain;
let transformedData: Op['retain'] =
    typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null
        ? otherData
        : length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformedData` variable would be assigned a different value based on the type of `otherData`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.retain;
const otherData = otherOp.retain;
let transformedData: Op['retain'] =
    typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null
        ? otherData
        : thisData;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformedData` variable would be assigned a different value based on the type of `otherData` and the value of `thisData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp
