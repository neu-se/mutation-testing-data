  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not called, which means that the `'drain'` event will not be emitted, even if the queue is drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument `1`, which would cause the `'drain'` event to be emitted with a different set of arguments than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 'foo'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different set of arguments than the original code fragment. The `'drain'` event would be emitted with the argument `'foo'`, which is a string
