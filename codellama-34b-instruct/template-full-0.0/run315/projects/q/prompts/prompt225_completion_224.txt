  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to `promiseDispatch` starting from the second argument, instead of passing all the arguments as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to `promiseDispatch`, instead of passing all the arguments as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to `promiseDispatch` starting from the third argument, instead of passing all the arguments as is.

DONE.
