  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could cause the diffing algorithm to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the minimum of the two iterator lengths, which could cause the diffing algorithm to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sum of the two iterator lengths, which could cause the diffing algorithm to produce different results.

DONE.
