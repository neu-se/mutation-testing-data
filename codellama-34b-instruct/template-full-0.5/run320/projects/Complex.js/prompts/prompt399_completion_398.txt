  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` and `acos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and `asin` is not the inverse function of `cosh`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` and `acos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and `atan` is not the inverse function of `cosh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acosh']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, and it is not the inverse function of `cosh`.

DONE.
