  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the functions depend on the specific order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, "extra argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the function call, which could cause issues if the functions are not designed to handle extra arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed, null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value has been added to the function call, which could cause issues if the functions are not designed to handle null values.

DONE.
