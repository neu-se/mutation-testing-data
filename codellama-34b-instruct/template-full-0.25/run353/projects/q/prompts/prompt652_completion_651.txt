  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the second argument instead of the third, potentially including the `name` argument in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the third argument instead of the second, potentially excluding the `name` argument in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the second argument and return only one argument, potentially including the `name` argument in the resulting array.

DONE.
