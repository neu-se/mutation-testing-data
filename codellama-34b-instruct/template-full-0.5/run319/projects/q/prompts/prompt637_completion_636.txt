  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" operator is used to delete a property from an object, while the "remove" operator is not a valid JavaScript operator and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "key"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" operator is used to delete a property from an object, while the concatenation of the "delete" operator with the string "key" would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" operator is used to delete a property from an object, while the subscript operator would attempt to access a property with the name "key" from the "delete" object, which is not a valid object.

DONE.
