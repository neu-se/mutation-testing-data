Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the intended `object` would cause the dispatch method to operate on a null reference, likely resulting in a runtime error or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties or methods on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the intended `object` would lead to similar issues as with `null`, where the dispatch method would fail to find the expected properties or methods, potentially causing a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of the intended `object` would cause the dispatch method to treat the string as an object, which may lead to incorrect method calls or property accesses, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
