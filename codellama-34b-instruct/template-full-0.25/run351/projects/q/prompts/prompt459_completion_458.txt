  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while the original code uses the original array. This could cause the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, 1), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes the first element of the array, while the original code removes the promise from the array. This could cause the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop(), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, while the original code removes the promise from the array. This could cause the `unt
