  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code recursively calls itself until the `flushing` variable is set to `false`, while the new code would only call itself once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a `MessageChannel` to schedule the next tick, while the new code would use the `setTimeout` function to schedule the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code flushes the queue immediately after the next tick is scheduled, while the new code would flush the queue after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.

DONE.
