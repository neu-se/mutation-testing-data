  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a reference to the resolved value of the promise, while `null` is a literal value that is not related to the promise. If the promise is fulfilled with a non-null value, the behavior of the code would be different.
