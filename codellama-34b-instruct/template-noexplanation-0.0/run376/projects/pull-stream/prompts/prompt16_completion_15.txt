  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This change will cause the switch statement to always fall through to the default case, which may result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This change will cause the switch statement to always fall through to the default case, which may result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This change will cause the switch statement to always fall through to the default case, which may result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
