  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the asterisk is a wildcard character in regular expressions, and the code is likely using a regular expression to match and extract the contents of parentheses. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a literal asterisk, the regular expression will match any string that contains an asterisk, rather than just the contents of parentheses.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '('
```
This would result in different behavior because the opening parenthesis character "(" is used to
