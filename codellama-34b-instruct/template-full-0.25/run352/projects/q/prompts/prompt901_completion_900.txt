  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` which rejects the promise with the provided error, while this code fragment rejects the promise with a new error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` which rejects the promise with the provided error, while this code fragment resolves the promise with the provided error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` which rejects the promise with the provided error, while this code fragment notifies the promise with the provided error.

DONE.
