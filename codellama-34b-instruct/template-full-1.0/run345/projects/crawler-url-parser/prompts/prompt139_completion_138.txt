  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `default.` part of the path, instead of replacing it with `/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove everything after the last `/` in the path, instead of just the `default.` part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(0, pageurl_path.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the path, instead of just the `default.` part.

DONE.
