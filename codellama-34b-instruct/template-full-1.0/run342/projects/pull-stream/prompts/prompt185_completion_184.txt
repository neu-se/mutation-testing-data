  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the value `true` to be returned, but `array.length` is a different value that may not be what the function is meant to return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the value `true` to be returned, but `array[i++]` is a different value that may not be what the function is meant to return.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the value `true` to be returned, but this new code fragment checks for the value `i >= array.length`, which may not be what the function is meant to return.

DONE.
