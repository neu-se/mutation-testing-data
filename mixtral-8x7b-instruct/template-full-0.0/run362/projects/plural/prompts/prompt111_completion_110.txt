 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'||'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require two pipes in a row to match the alternation in the regular expression, which is unlikely to occur in the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[|]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a literal pipe character instead of using it as an alternation operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the meaning of the regular expression to match the beginning of the string, rather than using the pipe as an alternation operator.

DONE.
