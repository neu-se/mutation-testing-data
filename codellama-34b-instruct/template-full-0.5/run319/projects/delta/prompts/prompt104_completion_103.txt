  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function filters out every other element in the array, while the new predicate function filters out every element that has an even index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function filters out the first element in the array, while the new predicate function filters out every element that has an index greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function filters out every element that has a retain property with a value of 0, while the new predicate function filters out every element that has a retain property with a value of 0 and also has a length property with a value of 0.

DONE.
