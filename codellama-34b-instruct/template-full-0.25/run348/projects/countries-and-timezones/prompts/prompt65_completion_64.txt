  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country with the given ID to null, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return null instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country with the given ID to an empty object, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { id: id, name: 'Unknown' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country with the given ID to an object with the same ID and a name of 'Unknown', which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object than the expected one.

DONE.
