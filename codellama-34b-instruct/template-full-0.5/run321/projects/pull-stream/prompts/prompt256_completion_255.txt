  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.pipe(values)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pipe` returns a new stream, so `_read` would be assigned a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.map(values)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array, so `_read` would be assigned a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.filter(values)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array, so `_read` would be assigned a different value than the original code.

DONE.
