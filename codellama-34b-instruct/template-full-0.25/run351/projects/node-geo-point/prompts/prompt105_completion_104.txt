  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is increased by 1, which would cause the tiles to be larger and the map to be zoomed in further.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is decreased by 1, which would cause the tiles to be smaller and the map to be zoomed out further.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom + 0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is increased by 0.5, which would cause the tiles to
