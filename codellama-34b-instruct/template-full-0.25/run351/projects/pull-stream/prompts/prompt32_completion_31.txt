  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply` will call the `pull` function with the `ref` array as its arguments, whereas the original code fragment `pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])` calls the `pull` function with the `read` variable as its first argument and the elements of the `ref` array as its subsequent arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes 4 arguments to the `pull` function, whereas this modified code fragment passes 5 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4], ref[5])
```
This would result
