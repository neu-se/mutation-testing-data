  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `verb`, which means that the `query` method would return `true` if the action is explicitly denied, instead of `false` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator concatenates the value of `verb` with the string `'x'`, which means that the `query` method would return `true` if the action is explicitly allowed, instead of `false` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts the value of `verb` to lowercase, which means that the `query` method would return `true` if the action is explicitly allowed, instead of `false` as intended.

DONE.
