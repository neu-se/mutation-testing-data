  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a single slash, which matches any single character. The buggy code fragment is also a single slash, but it matches any single character that is not a slash. This would cause the test to fail if the input string contains a slash, but pass if the input string does not contain a slash.
