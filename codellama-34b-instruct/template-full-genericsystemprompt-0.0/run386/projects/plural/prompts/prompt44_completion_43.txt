  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the word instead of the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last three characters of the word instead of the last two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last four characters of the word instead of the last two characters.

DONE.
