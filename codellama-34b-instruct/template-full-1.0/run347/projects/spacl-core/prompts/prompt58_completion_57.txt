  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because `\\$1` would be replaced with the literal string `"$1a"`, instead of the captured group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `\\$1` would be replaced with the literal string `"$11"`, instead of the captured group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1' + '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because `\\$1` would be replaced with the literal string `"$1$1"`, instead of the captured group.

DONE.
