Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an iterator of the keys in the `urlMap` instead of the values, leading to incorrect processing of the URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs (tuples) from the `urlMap`, which would not match the expected structure of the original code that processes only the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().filter(url => url.type === 'internal')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the values to only include those with a type of 'internal', potentially omitting other URLs that should be processed, thus altering the final output.

DONE.
