Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using `sin` instead of `cos` would change the calculation of the distance, leading to incorrect results as it would incorrectly apply the sine function where the cosine function is required.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the cosine calculation with a constant value of `1` would result in a fixed distance calculation, ignoring the actual geographical coordinates of the points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.random()` would introduce a random factor into the distance calculation, leading to unpredictable and incorrect distance results between the two geographical points.

DONE.
