  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `null` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with `null` as the argument, instead of the original `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with `undefined` as the argument, instead of the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with the string `"foo"` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with the string `"foo"` as the argument, instead of the original `value`.

DONE.
