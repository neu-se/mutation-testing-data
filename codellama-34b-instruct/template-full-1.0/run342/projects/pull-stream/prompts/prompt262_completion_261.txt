  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the read function is called with `true` as the first argument, it will return an error, but the callback function is not handling the error properly, so it will result in a no-op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the read function is called with `true` as the first argument, it will return an error, but the callback function is not handling the error properly, so it will result in a no-op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('read error')
```
This would result in different behavior because when the read function is called with `true` as the first argument, it will return an error, but the callback function is not handling the error properly, so it will result in a no-op.

DONE.
