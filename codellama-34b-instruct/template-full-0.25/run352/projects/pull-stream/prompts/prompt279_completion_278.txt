  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` would return a different value than `prop`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop * 2` would return a different value than `prop`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.length` would return a different value than `prop`, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
