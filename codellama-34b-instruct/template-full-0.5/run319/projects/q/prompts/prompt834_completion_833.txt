  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `progressed` callback for the `then` method, while the new code fragment uses `progress`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `progress` callback for the `then` method, while the new code fragment uses `progressed`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `progress` and `progressed` callbacks for the `then` method, while the new code fragment does not use either of them.

DONE.
