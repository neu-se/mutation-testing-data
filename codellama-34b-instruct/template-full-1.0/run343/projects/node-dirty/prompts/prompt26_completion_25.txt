  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error("Async error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with an error instead of undefined, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(undefined, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with two arguments instead of one, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(otherVal);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with a different value than the one that was set, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
