  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned the variable `baseIndex`, which is incremented in the loop. Replacing it with `0` would cause the loop to run indefinitely, potentially leading to a stack overflow or other runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned the variable `baseIndex`, which is incremented in the loop. Replacing it with `-1` would cause the loop to never execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned the variable `baseIndex`, which is incremented in the loop. Replacing it with `baseIndex - 1` would cause the loop to execute one fewer times, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

DONE.
