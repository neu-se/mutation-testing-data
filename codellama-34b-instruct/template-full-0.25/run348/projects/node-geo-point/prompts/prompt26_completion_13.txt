  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is used to convert degrees to radians, but multiplying the value by 2 would result in a different value that is not equivalent to the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is used to convert degrees to radians, but adding 1 to the value would result in a different value that is not equivalent to the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is used to convert degrees to radians, but subtracting 1 from the value would result in a different value that is not equivalent to the original.

DONE.
