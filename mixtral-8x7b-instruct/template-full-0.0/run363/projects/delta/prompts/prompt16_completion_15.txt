 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat empty objects and null values differently than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if `b` is an object, but only if it is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat arrays and other non-object types differently than the original code fragment.

By introducing these changes, you can evaluate how the test suite handles different edge cases and whether the tests cover these scenarios effectively. DONE.
