```
!_has_illegal_chars
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```

```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr.replace(/(http|https):\/\//, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is used to remove the `http` or `https` protocol from the `currentUrlStr` before passing it to the `_has_il
