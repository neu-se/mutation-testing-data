  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method is used to resolve a promise with a value, while the `reject` method is used to reject a promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is used to notify progress listeners of the promise's progress, while the `fulfill` method is used to resolve a promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is used to resolve a promise with a value, while the `fulfill` method is used to resolve a promise with a value.

DONE.
