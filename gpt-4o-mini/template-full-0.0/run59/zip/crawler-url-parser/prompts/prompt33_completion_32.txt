Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!localhost)\w+:/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for URLs that start with `//`, allowing URLs like `//example.com` to be treated as valid, which could lead to incorrect parsing of relative URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!\w+:)/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any URL that does not start with a protocol (like `http:` or `https:`) to be treated as valid, potentially leading to incorrect handling of URLs that should be considered relative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!\w+:).*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match any string that does not start with a protocol, which could incorrectly classify valid absolute URLs as relative, leading to incorrect URL resolution.

DONE.
