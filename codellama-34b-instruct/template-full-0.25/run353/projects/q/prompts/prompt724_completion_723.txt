  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `null` in this case. This means that the new promise will be fulfilled with the value `null`, regardless of the state of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `null` in this case. This means that the new promise will be fulfilled with the value `null`, regardless of the state of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method returns a new promise that is resolved with
