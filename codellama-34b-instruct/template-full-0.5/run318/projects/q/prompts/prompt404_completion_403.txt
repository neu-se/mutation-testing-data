  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method expects a reason to be passed, and passing `null` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `null` reason, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method expects a reason to be passed, and passing `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected with an `undefined` reason, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method expects a reason to be passed, and passing a string value would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
