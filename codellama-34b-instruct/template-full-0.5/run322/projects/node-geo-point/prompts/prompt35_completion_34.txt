  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the negative of the latitude of the first point, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a constant value of pi instead of the latitude of the first point, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
