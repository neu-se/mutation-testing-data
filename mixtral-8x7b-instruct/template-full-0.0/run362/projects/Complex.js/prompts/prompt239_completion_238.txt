 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the imaginary part of the result when the real part of the input is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp * 0.5
