Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive `null` instead of the actual attributes of `baseOp`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute inversion or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty object instead of the actual attributes would result in the `invert` function treating the attributes as non-existent, which could lead to unexpected results in the attribute transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `insert` property of `baseOp` instead of its `attributes`, which could cause the `invert` function to operate on the wrong data type or structure, leading to incorrect behavior in the transformation logic.

DONE.
