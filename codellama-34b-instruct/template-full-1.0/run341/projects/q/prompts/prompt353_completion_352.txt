  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with `null` instead of the expected exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with `exception`, instead of being rejected with the expected exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with `exception`, instead of being rejected with the expected exception.

DONE.
