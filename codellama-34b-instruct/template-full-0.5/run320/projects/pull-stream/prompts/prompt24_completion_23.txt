  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, `ref[1]` is accessed, but in the mutated code, `ref[2]` is accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, `ref[1]` is accessed, but in the mutated code, `ref[length - 1]` is accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, `ref[1]` is accessed, but in the mutated code, `ref[0]` is accessed.

DONE.
