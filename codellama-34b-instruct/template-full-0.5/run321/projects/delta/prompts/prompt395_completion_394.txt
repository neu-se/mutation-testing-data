  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different value than `thisOp.delete`, and would change the behavior of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `thisOp.delete`, and would change the behavior of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!thisOp.delete` is a different value than `thisOp.delete`, and would change the behavior of the `if` statement.

DONE.
