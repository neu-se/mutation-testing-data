  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbrt` computes the cube root of a number, while `sqrt` computes the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `log` computes the natural logarithm of a number, while `sqrt` computes the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `random` generates a random number between 0 and 1, while `sqrt` computes the square root.

DONE.
