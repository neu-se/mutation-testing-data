  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` parameter is a string, while this code checks if it is not a string. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` parameter is not a string, and could potentially lead to errors if the function relies on the `options` parameter being a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'str
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` parameter is equal to the string `'str'`, while this code checks if it is not equal. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` parameter is not equal to `'str'`, and could potentially lead to errors if the function relies on the `options` parameter being equal to `'str'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if
