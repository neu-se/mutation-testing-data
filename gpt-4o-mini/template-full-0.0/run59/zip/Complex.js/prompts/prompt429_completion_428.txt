Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the base of the power calculation from 10 to 2, which would affect the scaling of the complex number's real and imaginary parts, leading to incorrect rounding behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses Euler's number (approximately 2.718) instead of 10 as the base for the power calculation, which would yield a different scaling factor for the rounding operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(places), 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the absolute value of `places` instead of the default value of 10, which could lead to unexpected results when `places` is negative or zero, potentially causing incorrect rounding of the complex number.

DONE.
