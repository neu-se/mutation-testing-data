  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns the progress value, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (exception) { return reject(exception); }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function returns a rejected promise with the same exception as the original `_rejected` function, whereas `_rejected` returns a rejected promise with a new exception.

DONE.
