  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code calls the callback with both the error and the accumulated value, which could cause the callback to be called twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code calls the callback with the accumulated value and null, which could cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code calls the callback with the error and the data, which could cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
