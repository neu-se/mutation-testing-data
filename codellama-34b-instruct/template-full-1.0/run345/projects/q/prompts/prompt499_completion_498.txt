  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!name
```
This would result in different behavior because `!name` will evaluate to `true` if `name` is not only `null`, but also if it is `undefined`, an empty string, `0`, `NaN`, or any other falsy value. In contrast, the original code fragment will only evaluate to `true` if `name` is `null` or `undefined`, but not if it is any other falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof name === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof name === "undefined"` is a more explicit check for whether `name` is `undefined`, and it will not be affected by other falsy values. In contrast, the original code fragment will evaluate to `true` if `name` is `null`, `undefined`, or any other falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name == null
```
This would result in different behavior because
