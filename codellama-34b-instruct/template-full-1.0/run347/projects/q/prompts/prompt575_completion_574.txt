  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is not a function and therefore cannot be bound to the `continuer` function. The original code uses `this.resolved.bind` which correctly references the `resolved` method on the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not a function and therefore cannot be bound to the `continuer` function. The original code uses `this.deferred.bind` which correctly references the `deferred` method on the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise` is a constructor and cannot be bound to the `continuer` function. The original code uses `this.Promise.bind` which correctly references the `Promise` constructor on the `Q` object.
