  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, throw Error("Testing mutations")]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is no longer passed to the `dispatch` method, and an error is thrown instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat("Mutated")]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is concatenated with the string "Mutated", which will change the value of the arguments passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["Mutated name", args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` parameter is replaced with the string "Mutated name", which will change the name of the method being called.

DONE.
