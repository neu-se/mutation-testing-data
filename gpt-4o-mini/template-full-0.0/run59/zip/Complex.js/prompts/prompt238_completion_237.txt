Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the imaginary part of the square root from being dependent on the imaginary component `b` to being dependent on the real component `a`, which could lead to incorrect results for complex numbers where `b` is significant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the absolute value of `b`, which would incorrectly affect the calculation of the imaginary part of the square root, potentially leading to an incorrect magnitude and angle for the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the imaginary component `b` by 2, which would incorrectly scale the imaginary part of the square root, leading to an inaccurate representation of the complex number's square root.

DONE.
