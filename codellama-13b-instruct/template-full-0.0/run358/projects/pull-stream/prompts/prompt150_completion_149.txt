  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called, which would cause the callback to be called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value != null` expression is evaluated, which would cause the callback to be called with the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the value of `_value`, which would cause the callback to be called with the value of `_value`.

DONE.
