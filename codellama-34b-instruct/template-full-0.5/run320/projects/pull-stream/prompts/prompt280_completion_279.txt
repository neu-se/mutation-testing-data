  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper(data)` returns a value that is not necessarily a number, but the new code fragment `mapper(data) + 1` will always return a number, which could cause the tests to pass even if the mapper function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper(data)` returns a value that is not necessarily a number, but the new code fragment `mapper(data) * 2` will always return a number, which could cause the tests to pass even if the mapper function is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper(data)` returns a value that is not necessarily a
