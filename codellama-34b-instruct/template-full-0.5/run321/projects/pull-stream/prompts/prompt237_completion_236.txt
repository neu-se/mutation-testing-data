  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `cb` is a function that is expected to be called with a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string, and `cb` is a function that is expected to be called with a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing, and `cb` is a function that is expected to be called with a function that takes one argument and returns a value.

DONE.
