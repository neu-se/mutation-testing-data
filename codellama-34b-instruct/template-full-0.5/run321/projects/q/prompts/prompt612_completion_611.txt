  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to retrieve the value of the property with the name "key1" instead of "key".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to retrieve the value of the property with the name "key" and the value "value" instead of just the value of the property with the name "key".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this.key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to retrieve the value of the property with the name "key" from the current object instead of from the object passed as the first argument to the `get` method.

DONE.
