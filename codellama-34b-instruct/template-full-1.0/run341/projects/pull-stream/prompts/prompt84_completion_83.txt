  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
break
```
This would result in different behavior because the `break` statement would exit the enclosing loop immediately, whereas the original code fragment would continue to execute the loop until the condition `loop` is no longer true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continue` statement would skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration, whereas the original code fragment would continue to execute the loop until the condition `loop` is no longer true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would cause an error to be thrown when the `read` function is called, whereas the original code fragment would pass a value that is not `undefined` and therefore would not throw an error.

DONE.
