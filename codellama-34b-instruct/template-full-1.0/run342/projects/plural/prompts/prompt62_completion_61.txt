  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(octopus|virus|alga|bacterium)$/, function(w) { return w + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a rule for "bacterium" that is incorrect. The replacement rule uses a regular expression to match "bacterium" at the end of a word, and then adds an "i" to the end of the word. This would produce "bacterii" instead of "bacteria" as the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(criterion|judgment)$/, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has no rule for "criterion" or "judgment". The replacement rule uses a regular expression to match these words at the end of a sentence, and then adds an "s" to the end of the word. This would produce "criterions" or "judgments"
