  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ended` is the opposite of `ended`, so it would result in the opposite conditional behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which would cause the `if` condition to fail, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stop
```
This would result in different behavior because `stop` is not a defined variable or function, so it would throw a reference error, which would cause the code to fail in a different way than if the `ended` variable was used.

DONE.
