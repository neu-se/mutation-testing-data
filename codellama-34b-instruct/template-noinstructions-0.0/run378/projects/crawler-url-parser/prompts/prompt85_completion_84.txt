  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `()` after `trim`, which would cause the `trim` method to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `()` after `trim`, which would cause the `trim` method to not be called. Additionally, the `1` argument would cause the `trim` method to remove only the first character of the text, rather than all whitespace characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `()` after `trim`, which would cause the `trim` method to not be called. Additionally, the `2` argument would cause the `trim` method to remove only the first two characters of the text, rather than all
