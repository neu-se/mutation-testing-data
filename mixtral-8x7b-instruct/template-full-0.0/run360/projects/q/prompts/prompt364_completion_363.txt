 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function would return `null` instead of the original promise value, potentially causing issues in the rest of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function would always return the number `42`, regardless of the original promise value, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the rest of the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new fulfilled promise, so the `_fulfilled` function would return a promise instead of the original promise value. This could cause issues in the rest of the promise chain, especially if the next link in the chain is not expecting a promise.

DONE.
