  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because `.resume()` does not accept any arguments, while the original code fragment `.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>)` expects an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.resume(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because `.resume(true)` will resume the stream, but `.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>)` will only resume the stream if the argument is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because `.pause()` will pause the stream, while `.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>)` will resume the stream.

DONE.
