  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the pluralization rule to words that end in "ics" if the word is not already plural, while the modified code fragment would always add an "s" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is already plural or not.
