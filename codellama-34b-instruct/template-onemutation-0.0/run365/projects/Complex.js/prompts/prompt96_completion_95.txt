  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument for the `parser_exit` function, while the modified code fragment includes an argument of `1`, which would cause the function to exit with an error code of 1.
