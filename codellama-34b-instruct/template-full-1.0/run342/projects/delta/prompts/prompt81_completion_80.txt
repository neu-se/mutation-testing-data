  Option 1:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the beginning of the array instead of at the end.

Option 2:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last op instead of adding the new one.

Option 3:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply a function to each op in the array instead of adding a new one.

DONE.
