  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFile` and `writeFile` are different functions with different logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFile` and `readFileSync` are different functions with different logic, and `readFileSync` does not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFile` and `writeFileSync` are different functions with different logic, and `writeFileSync` does not return a promise.

DONE.
