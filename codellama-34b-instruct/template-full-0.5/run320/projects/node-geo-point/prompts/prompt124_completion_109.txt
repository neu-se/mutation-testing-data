  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the `point` variable instead of the latitude, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude of the `point` variable, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude of the `point` variable by 2, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
