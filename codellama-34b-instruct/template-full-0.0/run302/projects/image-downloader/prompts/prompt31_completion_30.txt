  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with a parameter of 10 would remove the first 10 characters from the URL, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method would check if the URL starts with "http" instead of "https".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('ftp')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method would check if the URL starts with "ftp" instead of "https".

DONE.
