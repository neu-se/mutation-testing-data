  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
always(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `done` method is called, the `always` method is called immediately, causing the promise to be fulfilled or rejected without considering the result of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `done` method is called, the `reject` method is called immediately, causing the promise to be rejected regardless of the result of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `done` method is called, the `resolve` method is called immediately, causing the promise to be fulfilled regardless of the result of the promise.

DONE.
