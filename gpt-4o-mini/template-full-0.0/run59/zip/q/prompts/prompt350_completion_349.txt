Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `self` would cause the promise to not have access to its own context, potentially leading to errors when trying to resolve or reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` instead of `self` may refer to a different context depending on how the function is called, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `self` would mean that the promise does not have a valid reference to its own context, which could lead to failures when trying to access properties or methods on the promise object.

DONE.
