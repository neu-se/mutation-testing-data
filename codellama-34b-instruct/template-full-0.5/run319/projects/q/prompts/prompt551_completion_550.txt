  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the promise would be incremented by 1, which could change the outcome of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the promise would be decremented by 1, which could change the outcome of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the promise would be doubled, which could change the outcome of the program.

DONE.
