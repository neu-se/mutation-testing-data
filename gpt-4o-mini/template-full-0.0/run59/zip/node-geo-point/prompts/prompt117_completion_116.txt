Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the destination point as the coordinates (0, 0), regardless of the input `coordinate`, leading to incorrect distance and bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ latitude: this.latitude + 1, longitude: this.longitude + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the latitude and longitude by adding 1 degree to each, which would yield an incorrect destination point based on the original coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the latitude of the current object for the destination calculation, ignoring the longitude and thus producing an invalid destination point.

DONE.
