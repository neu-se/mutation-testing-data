  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This will cause the regular expression to search for the pattern in the string, rather than matching it. This will result in a different behavior than the original code, and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This will cause the regular expression to replace the pattern in the string with a new string, rather than matching it. This will result in a different behavior than the original code, and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This will cause the regular expression to split the string into an array of substrings, rather than matching it. This will result in a different behavior than the original code, and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

DONE.
