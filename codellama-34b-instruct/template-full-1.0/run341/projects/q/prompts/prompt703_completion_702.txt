  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` expects an array as its first argument, but `arguments` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a constant expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `arguments` is a special object that contains all the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` can only be applied to properties of objects, while `arguments` is a special object that contains all the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
