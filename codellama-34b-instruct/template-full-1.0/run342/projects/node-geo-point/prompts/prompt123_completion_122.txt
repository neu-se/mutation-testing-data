  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateBearing` would be calling itself recursively, causing a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateBearing` would be using the `GeoPoint` object as the coordinate, rather than the `point` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateBearing` would be using the sum of the latitude and longitude as the coordinate, rather than the `point` parameter.

DONE.
