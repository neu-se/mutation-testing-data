  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
