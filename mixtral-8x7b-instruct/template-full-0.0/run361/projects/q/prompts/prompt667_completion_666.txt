 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would receive an empty array as its argument, instead of the expected arguments, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be passed as the second argument to the `array_slice()` function, which is not the intended behavior. This would cause unexpected results or errors depending on the context in which the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function would be passed as the second argument to the `array_slice()` function, which is not the intended behavior. This would cause unexpected results or errors depending on the implementation of the `array_slice()` function.

DONE.
