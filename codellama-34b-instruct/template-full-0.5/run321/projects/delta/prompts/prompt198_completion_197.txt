  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the last operation in the delta is now one less than before, which could cause the code to miss the last operation in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the first operation in the delta is now at position 0, which could cause the code to consider the first operation as the last operation in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the last operation in the delta is now one more than before, which could cause the code to consider a non-existent operation as the last operation in some cases.

DONE.
