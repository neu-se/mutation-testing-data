Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!clobber
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of the `clobber` option, causing the function to throw an error when `clobber` is true and delete the file when `clobber` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
clobber === 'true'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `clobber` is the string 'true', rather than a truthy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `clobber` is set to a non-string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
preserveTimestamps
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `preserveTimestamps` option instead of `clobber`, causing the function to delete the destination file only when timestamps are being preserved, rather than when the `clobber` option is enabled.

DONE.
