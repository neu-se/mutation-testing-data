  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then()` would create a new promise that resolves to the return value of the callback function, whereas `object` would simply return the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.catch()` would create a new promise that resolves to the return value of the callback function, whereas `object` would simply return the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.finally()` would create a new promise that resolves to the return value of the callback function, whereas `object` would simply return the original promise.

DONE.
