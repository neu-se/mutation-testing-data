Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the "get" operation instead of the intended "post" operation, which would lead to unexpected results when invoking methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", name);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes only the `name` instead of an array containing both `name` and `args`, which would cause the method invocation to fail due to missing arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [name, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the "apply" operation instead of "post", which would change the way the function is invoked and could lead to incorrect handling of the arguments.

DONE.
