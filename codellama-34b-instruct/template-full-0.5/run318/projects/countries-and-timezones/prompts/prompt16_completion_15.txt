  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current timezone to the `all` array instead of the `current` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(aliasTz.c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the aliased timezone to the `current` array instead of the current timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(tz.r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `r` property of the timezone object to the `current` array instead of the current timezone.

DONE.
