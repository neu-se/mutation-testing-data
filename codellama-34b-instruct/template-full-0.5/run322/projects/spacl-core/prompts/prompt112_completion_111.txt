  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, whereas the original code fragment `const verb of verbs` iterates over the values of the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the `verbs` object, whereas the original code fragment `const verb of verbs` iterates over the values of the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the `verbs` object, whereas the original code fragment `const verb of verbs` iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object.
