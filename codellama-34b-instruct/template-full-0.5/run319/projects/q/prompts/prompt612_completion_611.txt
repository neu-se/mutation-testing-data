  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be accessing the next key in the object instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be accessing the previous key in the object instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be accessing a different key in the object, based on the current key multiplied by 2.

DONE.
