  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'delete' operations would not be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority && otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because priority would be ignored, and 'delete' operations would be preferred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete' || otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because 'delete' operations would not be skipped, and empty operations would be considered.

DONE.
