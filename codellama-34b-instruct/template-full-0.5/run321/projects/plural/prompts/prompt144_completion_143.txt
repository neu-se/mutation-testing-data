  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` variable is a function that returns the plural form of a word, whereas `rule[0]` is a string that represents the singular form of the word. By replacing `rule[0]` with `rule[1]`, the code would be testing the plural form of the word instead of the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is undefined, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the singular form of the word to lowercase, which could cause the test to fail if the word is not already in lowercase.

DONE.
