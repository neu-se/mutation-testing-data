  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be incremented by one, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss a character in the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be decremented by one, potentially causing the diff algorithm to skip a character in the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be multiplied by two, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss or repeat characters in the comparison.

DONE.
