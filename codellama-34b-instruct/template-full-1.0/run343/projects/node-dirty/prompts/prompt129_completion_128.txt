  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `cork` argument to `0`, effectively disabling corking for the `_writeStream`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `cork` argument to `-1`, which is an invalid value for corking.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the `cork` argument entirely, causing the `_writeStream` to default to corking for each chunk.

DONE.
