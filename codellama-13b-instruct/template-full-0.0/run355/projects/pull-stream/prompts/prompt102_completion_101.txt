  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the data to the console, while the modified code fragment logs the data to the console and then returns it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the data to the console, while the modified code fragment logs the length of the data to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the data to the console, while the modified code fragment logs the string representation of the data to the console.

DONE.
