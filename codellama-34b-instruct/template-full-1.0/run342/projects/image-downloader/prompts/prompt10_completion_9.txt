  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + '.png'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would append the string '.png' to the original `options.dest`, resulting in a different path being used for the destination file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would reverse the characters in the `options.dest` string, potentially resulting in a different path being used for the destination file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/[^\/]+/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would remove any characters that are not a forward slash from the `options.dest` string, potentially resulting in a different path being used for the destination file.

DONE.
