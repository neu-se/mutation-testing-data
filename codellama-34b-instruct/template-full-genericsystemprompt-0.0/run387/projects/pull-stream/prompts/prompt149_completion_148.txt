  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the object, while `object` is the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values of the object, while `object` is the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs of the object, while `object` is the object itself.

DONE.
