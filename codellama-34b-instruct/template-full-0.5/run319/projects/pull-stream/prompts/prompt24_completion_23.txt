  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` is the first element of the `ref` array, while `ref[1]` is the second element. Using `ref[0]` would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[2]` is the third element of the `ref` array, while `ref[1]` is the second element. Using `ref[2]` would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[3]` is the fourth element of the `ref` array, while `ref[1]` is the second element. Using `ref[3]` would cause the function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
