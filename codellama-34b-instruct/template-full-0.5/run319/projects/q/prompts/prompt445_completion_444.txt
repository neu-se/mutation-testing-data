  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not trigger the `process.emit` function, which is used to handle unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the `process.emit` function with the wrong event type, which could cause confusion and errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, which could cause the promise to be reported as unhandled multiple times.

DONE.
