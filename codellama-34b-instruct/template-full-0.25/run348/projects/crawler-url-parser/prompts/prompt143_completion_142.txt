  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original code.

DONE.
