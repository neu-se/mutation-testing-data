  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the negation operator (`!==`) instead of the equality operator (`===`). This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated === false
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the equality operator (`===`) instead of the negation operator (`!==`). This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This code fragment uses the negation operator (`!`) to invert the value of the `deprecated` variable. If `deprecated` is `true`, this will return `false`, and if `deprecated` is `false`, this will
