  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method is called on the `RegExp` object, which would cause the `RegExp` object to be evaluated as a boolean value, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exec()` method is called on the `RegExp` object, which would cause the `RegExp` object to be evaluated as a boolean value, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `RegExp` object, which would cause the `RegExp` object to be evaluated as a string, resulting in a different outcome.

DONE.
