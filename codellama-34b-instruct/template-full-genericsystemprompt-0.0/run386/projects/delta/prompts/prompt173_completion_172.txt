  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to always read one more character than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the code to always read one fewer character than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the code to always read twice as many characters as it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
