  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.forget()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.forget()` is a function that forgets the deferred promise, whereas `defer` is a deferred promise that needs to be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve()` is a function that resolves the deferred promise, whereas `defer` is a deferred promise that needs to be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject()` is a function that rejects the deferred promise, whereas `defer` is a deferred promise that needs to be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
