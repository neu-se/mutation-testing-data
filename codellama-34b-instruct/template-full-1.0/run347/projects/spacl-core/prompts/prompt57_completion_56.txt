  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([e.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any letter "e" in addition to the literal characters ".$".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the case of the matched characters, potentially matching more than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the literal character ".", not the escaped version of "$" which is what we are trying to match.

DONE.
