  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, and the `predicate` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one less time than it should, and the `predicate` function would not be called for the last iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute two more times than it should, and the `predicate` function would be called twice for the last iteration.

DONE.
