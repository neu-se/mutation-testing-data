  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[message]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to access the property `message` of the object `deferred`, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise[message]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to access the property `message` of the object `promise`, which is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to call a function `message()` that is not defined.

DONE.
