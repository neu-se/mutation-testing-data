  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, regardless of the value of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is falsy, regardless of the value of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `?:` evaluates the expression `abort` and returns `true` if it is truthy, and `false` if it is falsy.

DONE.
