  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove the last element of the array, whereas the original code fragment `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would leave the array unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` would remove the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would leave the array unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` would remove the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would leave the array unchanged.

DONE.
