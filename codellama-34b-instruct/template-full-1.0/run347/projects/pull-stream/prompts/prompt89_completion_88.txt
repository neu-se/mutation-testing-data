  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
> test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop(test)` would evaluate to `false`, whereas `prop(> test)` would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
^ test
```
This would result in different behavior because `^` is the bitwise XOR operator, and `prop(^ test)` would result in the bitwise XOR of `test` with a random number, which would likely produce a different value and result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, and `prop(!test)` would evaluate to `false` if `test` evaluates to `true`, and vice versa.

DONE.
