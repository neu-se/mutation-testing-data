  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while the replaced code fragment checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere or if it is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && !this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while the replaced code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere and is also a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || (this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the
