  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This change will cause the `floor` method to always round up, rather than down, which may cause unexpected behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This change will cause the `floor` method to always round down, rather than up, which may cause unexpected behavior in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This change will cause the `floor` method to always round to the nearest even number, which may cause unexpected behavior in some cases.

DONE.
