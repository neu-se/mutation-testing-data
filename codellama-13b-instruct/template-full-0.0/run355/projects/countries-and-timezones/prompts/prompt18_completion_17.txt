  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `id` to the `all` array, while the buggy code fragment pushes the `id` to the `current` array. This would cause the test to fail, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of bug.
