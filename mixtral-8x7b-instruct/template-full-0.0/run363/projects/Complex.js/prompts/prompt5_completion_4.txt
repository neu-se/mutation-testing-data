 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(x) * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result would be changed, which is not equivalent to the original `Math.exp(-x)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh(x)` is not equivalent to `-x` for negative `x` values, unlike `Math.exp(-x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0.5 * (Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x))
```
This would result in different behavior because it is the actual definition of `sinh(x)`, which is not equivalent to `-x` for negative `x` values, unlike `Math.exp(-x)`.

DONE.
