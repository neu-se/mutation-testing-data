  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function returns a URL object with the URL string as the `url` property, but replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a string literal would cause the `Map` to store a string key instead of a URL object, which would likely cause errors elsewhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` would now contain a key with the value `null`, which is unlikely to match any URL strings used in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` would now contain a key with the value `undefined`, which is unlikely to match any URL strings used in the code.

DONE.
