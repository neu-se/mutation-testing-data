  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextType
```

This would result in different behavior because `nextType` is not a method of `OpIterator`, whereas `peekType` is. This would cause the code to throw an error when the loop is entered for the first time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.nextType
```

This would result in different behavior because `nextType` is not a method of `OpIterator`, whereas `peekType` is. This would cause the code to throw an error when the loop is entered for the first time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekType() === 'insert'
```

This would result in different behavior because `this.peekType()` returns a boolean value, whereas `peekType` is a function that returns a string. This would cause the loop to condition to be different from the original code fragment, potentially entering the loop in different scenarios.

DONE.
