  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is concatenated with the string "foo", which would change the value of the `verb` variable and potentially alter the behavior of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb - "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is subtracted by the string "foo", which would change the value of the `verb` variable and potentially alter the behavior of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb * "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is multiplied by the string "foo", which would change the value of the `verb` variable and potentially alter the behavior of the `query` method.

DONE.
