  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the predicate function, which is expected to be a function that takes an `Op` object and an index as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation should be included in the filtered array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => void
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the predicate function, which is expected to be a function that takes an `Op` object and an index as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation should be included in the filtered array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the predicate function, which is expected to be a function that takes an `Op` object and an index as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether
