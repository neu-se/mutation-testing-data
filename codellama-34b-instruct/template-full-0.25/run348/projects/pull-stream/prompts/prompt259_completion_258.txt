  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that returns a stream, but `nextStream()` would call the function and return the result of the function, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function is called with the `null` and `function` arguments, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
