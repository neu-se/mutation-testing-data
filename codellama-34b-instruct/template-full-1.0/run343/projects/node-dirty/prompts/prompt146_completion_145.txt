  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'error'` is a different event name and the callback for `'drain'` would not be called, leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'end'` is a different event name and the callback for `'drain'` would not be called, leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'close'` is a different event name and the callback for `'drain'` would not be called, leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
