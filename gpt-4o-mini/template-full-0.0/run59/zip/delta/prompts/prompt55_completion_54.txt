Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any object (including non-array objects) to pass the check, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the `ops` parameter is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `ops` is not null or undefined, but would not verify if `ops` is an array, allowing non-array types to be incorrectly accepted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an instance of the Array class, which may not work correctly in environments with multiple execution contexts (like iframes), leading to false negatives for array checks.

DONE.
