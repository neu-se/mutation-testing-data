  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not equal to `null`, which is what the original code fragment is checking for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not equal to `null`, which is what the original code fragment is checking for.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not equal to `null`, which is what the original code fragment is checking for.

DONE.
