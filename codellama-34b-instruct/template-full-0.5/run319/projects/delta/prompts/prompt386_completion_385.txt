  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the minimum of the two lengths, while this code would use the sum of the two lengths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the minimum of the two lengths, while this code would use the maximum of the two lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() || otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the minimum of the two lengths, while this code would use a boolean value based on whether either length is non-zero.

DONE.
