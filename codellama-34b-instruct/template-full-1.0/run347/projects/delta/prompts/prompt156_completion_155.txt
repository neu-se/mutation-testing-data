  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `otherIter` cursor, potentially skipping over the next iteration of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `thisIter` cursor, potentially skipping over the next iteration of the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let delta = 0;
while (index < end && iter.hasNext()) {
  let nextOp;
  if (index < start) {
    nextOp = iter.next(start - index);
  } else {
    nextOp = iter.next(end - index);
    ops.push(nextOp);
  }
  index += 1;
}
return new Delta(ops);
```
This would result
