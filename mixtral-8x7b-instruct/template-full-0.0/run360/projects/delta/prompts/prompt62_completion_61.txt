 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any>[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty array, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'length'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'length', whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the given object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(attributes as any).concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `concat` method on the `attributes` object, which would result in a runtime error if `attributes` is not an array. `Object.keys` would not produce this error.

DONE.
