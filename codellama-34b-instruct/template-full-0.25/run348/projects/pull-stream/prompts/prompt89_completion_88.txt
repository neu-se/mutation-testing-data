  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test` is a function, and adding 1 to a function would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test` is a function, and it does not have a property called `foo`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test` is a function, and calling it with the argument `1` would result in a different return value than calling it with no arguments.

DONE.
