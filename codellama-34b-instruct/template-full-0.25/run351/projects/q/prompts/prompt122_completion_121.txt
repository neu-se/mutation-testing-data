  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over the properties of the `object` and would instead throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the properties of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over the properties of the `object` and would instead throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the properties of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the properties of an empty object, which would not include the properties of the original `object`.

DONE.
