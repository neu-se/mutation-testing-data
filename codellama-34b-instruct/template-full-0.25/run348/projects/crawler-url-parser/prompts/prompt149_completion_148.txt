  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 0
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings, and then filters out any empty strings from the array. However, the buggy code fragment uses the `split` method with a different separator, which would result in a different array of substrings being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 1
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out any empty strings from the array, but the buggy code fragment filters out any strings with a length of less than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(
