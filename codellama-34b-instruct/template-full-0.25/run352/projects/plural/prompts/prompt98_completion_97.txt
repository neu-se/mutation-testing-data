  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches any character, not just the letter "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/e/, 'a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/e/` matches any character, not just the letter "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/[aeiou]/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[aeiou]/` matches any vowel, not just the letter "a".

DONE.
