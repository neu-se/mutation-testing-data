  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(<PLACEHOLDER, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(<PLACEHOLDER, 1)` would return a different slice of the `args` array than `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice(1)` would modify the `args` array in place, whereas `array_slice(<PLACEHOLDER, 1)` would not modify the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove and return the last element of the `args` array, whereas `array_slice(<PLACEHOLDER, 1)` would return a slice of the array without modifying it.

DONE.
