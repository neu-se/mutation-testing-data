  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `i > len` is never true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition `i <= len` is true when `i` is equal to `len`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition `i >= len` is true when `i` is equal to `len`.

DONE.
