  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with only one argument, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with only one argument, which would cause an error.

DONE.
