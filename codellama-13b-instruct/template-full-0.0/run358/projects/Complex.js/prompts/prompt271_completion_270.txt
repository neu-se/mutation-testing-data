  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the argument of the complex number in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['re'], this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the argument of the complex number in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], this['re']) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the argument of the complex number in a different way and adds Ï€ to the result.

DONE.
