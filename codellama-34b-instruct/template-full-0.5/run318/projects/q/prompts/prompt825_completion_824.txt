  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("something went wrong");

});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of the promise, but instead of returning a new promise, it returns a rejected promise. This would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `onUnhandledError` function.
