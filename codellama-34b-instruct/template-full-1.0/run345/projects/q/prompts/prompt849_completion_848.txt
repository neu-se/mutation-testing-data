  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally resolve the promise, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally reject the promise, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(update);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally notify the promise, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
