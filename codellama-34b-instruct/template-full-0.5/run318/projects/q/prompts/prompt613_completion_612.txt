  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `post` is a method that sends a message to a value in a future turn, while `get` is a method that gets the value of a property in a future turn. Using `post` instead of `get` would cause the code to send a message to the value instead of getting its property, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets the value of a property in a future turn, while `get` is a method that gets the value of a property in a future turn. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to set the value of the property to `undefined` instead of getting its value, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in
