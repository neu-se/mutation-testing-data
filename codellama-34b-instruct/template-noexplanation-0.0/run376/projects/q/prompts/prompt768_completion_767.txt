  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `then` method to handle the promise's resolution. The `noop` function is used as the fulfillment and rejection handlers, which means that the promise's value or reason will be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return promise;
}, noop)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses an anonymous function as the fulfillment handler. The function returns the promise, which means that the promise's value will be passed through to the next promise in the chain. The rejection handler is still `noop`, which means that any rejection will be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, function () {
    return promise;
})
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but
