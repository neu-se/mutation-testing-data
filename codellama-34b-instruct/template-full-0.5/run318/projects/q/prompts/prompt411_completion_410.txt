  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be different from the original value, which could cause issues in the code that uses the result of the `inspect` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be different from the original value, which could cause issues in the code that uses the result of the `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be different from the original value, which could cause issues in the code that uses the result of the `inspect` method.

DONE.
