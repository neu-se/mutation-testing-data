  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, while this new code calculates the distance plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, while this new code calculates the distance multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, while this new code calculates the distance minus one.

DONE.
