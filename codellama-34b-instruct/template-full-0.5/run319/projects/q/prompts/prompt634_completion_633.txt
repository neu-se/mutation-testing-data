  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to return a rejected promise, which would trigger the `catch` block in the `Q.get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to return a fulfilled promise with the value `42`, which would not trigger the `catch` block in the `Q.get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000).then(() => {
    throw new Error("Test error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that is resolved after a delay of 1 second, and then throws an error. This would trigger the `catch` block in the `Q.get` method.
