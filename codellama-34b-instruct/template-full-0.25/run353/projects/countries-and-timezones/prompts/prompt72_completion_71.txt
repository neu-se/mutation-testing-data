  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an additional argument, which could affect its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could affect its behavior.

DONE.
