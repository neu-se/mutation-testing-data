  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the type of `rule[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the type of `rule[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].includes(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the type of `rule[0]`.

DONE.
