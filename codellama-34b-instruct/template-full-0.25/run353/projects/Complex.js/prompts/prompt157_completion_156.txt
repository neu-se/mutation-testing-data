  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `this` and `z` being zero, while the new code only checks for `this` being zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `this` and `z` being zero, while the new code checks for either `this` or `z` being zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && !z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `this` and `z` being zero, while the new code checks for `this` being zero and `z` not being zero.

DONE.
