 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.toString()` returns a string representation of the `cb` function, rather than invoking the function as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cb
```
This would result in different behavior because if `cb` is not a number, attempting to divide by it would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number, whereas the original code invokes the `cb` function.

These mutations would help to ensure that the test suite covers edge cases and checks for the correct types of arguments. DONE.
