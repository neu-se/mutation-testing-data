  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `next.promise` with the value of `head`, but this new code resolves it with the value of `tail`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(ends.promise.get("tail"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `next.promise` with the value of `head`, but this new code resolves it with the value of `tail`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `next.promise` with the value of `head`, but this new code resolves it with a rejected promise.

DONE.
