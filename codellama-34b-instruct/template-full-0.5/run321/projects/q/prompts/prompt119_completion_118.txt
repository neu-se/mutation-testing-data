  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.bind(null)` is a function that returns a new function with the `this` context bound to `null`, whereas `uncurryThis` is a function that returns a new function with the `this` context bound to the original function's `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype.call.bind(uncurryThis)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.call.bind(uncurryThis)` is a function that returns a new function with the `this` context bound to `uncurryThis`, whereas `uncurryThis` is a function that returns a new function with the `this` context bound to the original function's `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(Object.create(null))
```
This would
