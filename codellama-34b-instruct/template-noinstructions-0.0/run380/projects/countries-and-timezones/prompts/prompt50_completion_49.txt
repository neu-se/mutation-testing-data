  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter, which would return a timezone object with the given name, but it would not memoize the timezone object in the `timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter and the `deprecated` option set to `true`, which would return a timezone object with the given name, but it would not memoize the timezone object in the `timezones` object and would return a deprecated timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter and
