 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { setTimeout(flush, 1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a delay of 1ms instead of being executed in the next iteration of the event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { while (true) {} }
