  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the dot product of the two vectors, which is not the same as the dot product of the sine of the vectors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the dot product of the cosine of the first vector and the sine of the second vector, which is not the same as the dot product of the sine of the vectors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad + point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the sum of the two vectors, which is not the same as the dot product of the sine of the vectors.

DONE.
