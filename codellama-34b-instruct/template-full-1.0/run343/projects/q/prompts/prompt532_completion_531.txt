  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in a `TypeError` because `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in a `TypeError` because `undefined` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the function returns nothing, which means that `then` is called with an empty array, which means that `then` is called again with an empty array, and so on.

DONE.
