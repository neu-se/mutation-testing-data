  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to always return the same value, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a value that is the sum of the latitude of the two input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * φ2
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a value that is the product of the latitude of the two input coordinates.

DONE.
