  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any policies with a null name, which could cause the `query` method to return `null` for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map the policies to their lowercase names, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => acc + policy.name.length, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the policies to their total name length, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results for some inputs.

DONE.
