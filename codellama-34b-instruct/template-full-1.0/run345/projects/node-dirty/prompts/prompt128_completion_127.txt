  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork()` would allow data to be written to the write stream immediately, rather than waiting for the stream to be corked. This could cause the application to write data to the file stream before it was intended, potentially leading to errors or data corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the write stream, preventing any further writes from being made. This could cause the application to fail to write data to the file stream, potentially leading to errors or data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('invalid data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the write stream would receive invalid data, potentially leading to errors or data corruption.

DONE.
