  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method takes a positive integer as an argument, and passing in `-1` would cause the iteration to go in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next value in the iteration without advancing the iteration, while the `next` method advances the iteration and returns the next value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `previous` method returns the previous value in the iteration, while the `next` method returns the next value.

DONE.
