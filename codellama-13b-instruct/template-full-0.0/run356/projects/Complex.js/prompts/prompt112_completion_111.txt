  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number instead of leaving it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of leaving them unchanged.

DONE.
