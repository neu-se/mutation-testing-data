  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getName()` method is not defined for the `policy` object, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` or return `undefined`. In contrast, the original code fragment `policy.name` accesses the `name` property of the `policy` object, which would return the actual name value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the concatenation of the `name` property and the string "foo". In contrast, the original code fragment `policy.name` returns the actual name value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name && "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "foo" if the `name` property of the `policy` object is truthy, and `undefined` otherwise. In contrast, the original code fragment `policy.name` returns the
