  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string or an object with a `toString` method, but `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string or an object with a `toString` method, but `undefined` would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string or an object with a `toString` method, but `42` is a number and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
