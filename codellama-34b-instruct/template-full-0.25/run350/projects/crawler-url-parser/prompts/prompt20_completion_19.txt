  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^http:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with "//", while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with "//", while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^ftp:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with "//", while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with "ftp://".

DONE.
