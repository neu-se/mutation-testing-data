  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].attributes = newOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `attributes` property of `newOp` to the `attributes` property of the previous operation, rather than to the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].retain = newOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `retain` property of `newOp` to the `retain` property of the previous operation, rather than to the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].delete = newOp.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `delete` property of `newOp` to the `delete` property of the previous operation, rather than to the current operation.

DONE.
