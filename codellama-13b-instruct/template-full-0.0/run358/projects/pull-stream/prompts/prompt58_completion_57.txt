  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `done` is undefined, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `false` if `done` is undefined. This could potentially cause the `sink` function to behave differently if the `done` callback is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `done` is null, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `false` if `done` is null. This could potentially cause the `sink` function to behave differently if the `done` callback is set to null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `done` is false, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `false` if `done`
