  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```swift
args.value = callback;
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.value` would be overwritten with `callback` instead of being passed as an argument to `callback.apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```swift
result = callback(args.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` would be assigned the return value of `callback` called on `args.value` instead of being the result of `callback` applied to `self` and `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```swift
callback = args.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` would be overwritten with `args.value` instead of being called with `self` and `args`.

DONE.
