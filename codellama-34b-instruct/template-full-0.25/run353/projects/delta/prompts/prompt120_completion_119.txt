  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is a different property than `elem.delete`, and it may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.insert` is a different property than `elem.delete`, and it may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.length` is a different property than `elem.delete`, and it may have a different value.

DONE.
