 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value && value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider an object with a `then` property, even if it's `null` or `undefined`, as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof value === 'object' && value.hasOwnProperty('then')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any object with a `then` property, even if it's not a function, as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Promise]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider objects that are instances of the built-in `Promise` constructor as promises, and not other promise-like objects.

DONE.
