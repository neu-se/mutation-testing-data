Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, causing the code to execute the optimization when the last operation is not equal, which could lead to incorrect concatenation of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are any operations in the delta instead of checking if the last operation is equal, potentially skipping the optimization when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check the type of the next operation in `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations based on their types rather than their equality.

DONE.
