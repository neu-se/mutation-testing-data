  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is the resolved value of the promise, while `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.rejected` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been rejected, while `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.isFulfilled` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been fulfilled, while `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise has been fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
