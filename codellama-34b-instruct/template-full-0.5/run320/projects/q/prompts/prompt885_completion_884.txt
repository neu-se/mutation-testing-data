  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed a function that was defined elsewhere in the code, while this replacement pushes `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed a function that was defined elsewhere in the code, while this replacement pushes an empty function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed a function that was defined elsewhere in the code, while this replacement pushes a function that is defined in the `deferred` object.

DONE.
