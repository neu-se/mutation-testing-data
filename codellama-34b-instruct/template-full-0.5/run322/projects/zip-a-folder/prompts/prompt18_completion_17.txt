  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator is used instead of the bitwise OR operator, which would result in a different permission check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the X_OK constant is used instead of R_OK or W_OK, which would result in a different permission check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the F_OK constant is used instead of R_OK, W_OK, or X_OK, which would result in a different permission check.

DONE.
