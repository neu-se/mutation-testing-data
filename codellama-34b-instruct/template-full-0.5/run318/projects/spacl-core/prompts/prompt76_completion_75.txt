  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `rule` variable was defined, but the new code fragment would always evaluate to `false` because `rule` is being set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `rule` variable was defined, but the new code fragment would always evaluate to `false` because `rule` is being set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `rule` variable was defined, but the new code fragment would always evaluate to `true` because `rule` is being set to a non-zero value.

DONE.
