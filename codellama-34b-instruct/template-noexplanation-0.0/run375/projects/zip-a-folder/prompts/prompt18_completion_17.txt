  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This code fragment will check if the file has both read and write permissions, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This code fragment will check if the file has either read or write permissions, but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This code fragment will check if the file has read, write, or execute permissions, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
