  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `countryId` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, options + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `options` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property would be set to `true`, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
