  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the accumulated value, while the new code fragment calls the callback with both the error and the accumulated value. This could cause the callback to be called with unexpected arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `reduce` function.

DONE.
