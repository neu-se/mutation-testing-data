  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromPromise` method is used to wrap a function that returns a promise, while the `fromCallback` method is used to wrap a function that takes a callback as its last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromiseSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromPromiseSync` method is used to wrap a function that returns a promise and is synchronous, while the `fromPromise` method is used to wrap a function that returns a promise and is asynchronous.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromNodeCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromNodeCallback` method is used to wrap a function that takes a Node.js-style callback (i.e. with a signature of `(error, result)`) as its last argument, while the `fromPromise` method is used to wrap a
