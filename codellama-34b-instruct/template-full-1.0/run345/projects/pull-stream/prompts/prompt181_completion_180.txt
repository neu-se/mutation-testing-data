  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not the same as the `onAbort` function that was originally passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not the same as the `onAbort` function that was originally passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function() {}` is not the same as the `onAbort` function that was originally passed as an argument.

DONE.
