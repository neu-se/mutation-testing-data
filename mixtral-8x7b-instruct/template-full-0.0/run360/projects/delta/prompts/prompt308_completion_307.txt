 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.eachLine(predicate, newline);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would recursively call `eachLine` instead of applying the provided predicate to the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
predicate(line, {}, i + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the `i` variable before passing it to the predicate, causing the line numbers to be off by one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
predicate(line, {}, i - 1);
