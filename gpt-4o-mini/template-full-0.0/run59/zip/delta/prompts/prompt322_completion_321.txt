Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the slice, potentially skipping the first element and including additional elements that were not intended to be part of the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty slice, which would lead to no operations being processed in the subsequent loop, effectively ignoring the intended operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adjusts the starting index to one before the intended position, potentially including an unintended element in the slice and altering the logic of the operation processing.

DONE.
