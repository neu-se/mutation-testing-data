  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` keyword takes a number representing the amount of time to delay the promise resolution, but `defer(1)` would delay the resolution by only 1 millisecond, which is much less than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `deffer` is a typo of `defer`, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is an expression that evaluates to `undefined`, and it would result in the promise not being delayed at all.

DONE.
