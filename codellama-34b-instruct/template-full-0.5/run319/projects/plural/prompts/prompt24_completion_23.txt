  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the first two characters of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the first two characters of the word and then adds the letter 'e' to the end of the word.
