  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment never threw an error, whereas this modified code fragment would always throw an error whenever `Q` is called. This would cause any tests that use `Q` to fail, potentially revealing weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 1 / 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment never divided by zero, whereas this modified code fragment would always divide by zero whenever `Q` is called. This would cause any tests that use `Q` to fail, potentially revealing weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment never resolved with `null`, whereas this modified code fragment would always resolve with `null` whenever `Q` is called. This would cause any tests that use `Q`
