  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array than the original code, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array than the original code, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array than the original code, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with incorrect arguments.

DONE.
