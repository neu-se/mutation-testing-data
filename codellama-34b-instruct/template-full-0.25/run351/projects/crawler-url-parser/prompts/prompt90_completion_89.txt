  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href) || href.includes("http://")

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href) || href.includes("https://")

This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `href.includes("https://")` would cause the code to treat URLs with the "https://" protocol as invalid, even if they are otherwise valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp
