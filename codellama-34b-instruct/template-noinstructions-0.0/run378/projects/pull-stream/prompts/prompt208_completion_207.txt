  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would pass the `aborted` error to the callback, while the new code fragment `null` would pass a `null` error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would pass the `aborted` error to the callback, while the new code fragment `undefined` would pass an `undefined` error instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would pass the `aborted` error to the callback, while the new code fragment `new Error('aborted')` would pass a new error object with the message 'aborted' instead.

DONE.
