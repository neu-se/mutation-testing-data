  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.username
```
This would result in different behavior because `username` is a valid property of a URL object, but it is not used in the `Map` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `href` is a valid property of a URL object, but it is not used in the `Map` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.url` is the URL of the base URL, which is used in the `Map` instance.

DONE.
