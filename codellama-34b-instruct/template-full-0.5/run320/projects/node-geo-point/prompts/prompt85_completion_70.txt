  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the destination point instead of the source point, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + π
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a constant value to the latitude, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude by a constant value, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
