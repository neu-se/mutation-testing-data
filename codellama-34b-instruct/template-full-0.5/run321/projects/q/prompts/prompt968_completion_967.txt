  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and `args` is not an array, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `apply` on `null` with `args` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and `args` is not an array, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `apply` on `undefined` with `args` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is not a function, and `args` is not an array, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `apply` on `this` with `args` as an argument.

DONE.
