Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `delta` object without calling the `chop` method, which may lead to an unprocessed or unmodified `delta` instead of the expected chopped version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.slice();
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a shallow copy of the `delta` object instead of the modified version, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the state of the `delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.push({}); 
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty object to the `delta`, altering its contents and structure, rather than returning the processed `delta` as intended.

DONE.
