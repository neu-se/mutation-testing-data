  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single value, while `data + 1` is a new value that is one greater than `data`. This change would cause the program to behave differently when the `test` function is called with a value that is one greater than the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single value, while `data * 2` is a new value that is twice the value of `data`. This change would cause the program to behave differently when the `test` function is called with a value that is twice the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single value, while `data - 1` is a new value that is one less than `data
