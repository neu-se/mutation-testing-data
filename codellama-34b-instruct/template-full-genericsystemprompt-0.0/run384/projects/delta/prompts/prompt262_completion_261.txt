  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is a different variable than `thisOp`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `thisOp.attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

DONE.
