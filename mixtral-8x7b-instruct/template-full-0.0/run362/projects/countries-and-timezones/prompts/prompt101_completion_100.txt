 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key in tzs
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key exists in the object, rather than checking the `.deprecated` property of the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].hasOwnProperty('deprecated')
