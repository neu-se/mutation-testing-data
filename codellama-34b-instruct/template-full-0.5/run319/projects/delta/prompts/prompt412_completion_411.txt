  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the iterator, and adding 1 to it would cause the iterator to skip over the next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the iterator, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the iterator to return a shorter length than the actual length of the next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the iterator, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the iterator to return a length that is twice the actual length of the next op.

DONE.
