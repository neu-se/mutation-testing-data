Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] of this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this._data.entries()` returns an iterator of key-value pairs, which may not be handled correctly in the existing loop, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in this._data)
```
This would result in different behavior because using a `for...in` loop iterates over the keys of the `Map` object as strings, which is not the intended behavior since `this._data` is a `Map` and should be iterated using its own methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys()` returns an iterator of keys only, meaning that `val` would be `undefined` in the loop, leading to incorrect processing of values.

DONE.
