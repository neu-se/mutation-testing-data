  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.define
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property that is an object with a `define` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.require
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property that is an object with a `require` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.define && define.amd.require
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property that is an object with both a `define` and a `require` property.

DONE.
