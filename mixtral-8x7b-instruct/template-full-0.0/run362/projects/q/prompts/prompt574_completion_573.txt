 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generator` object would be set to `null`, causing issues when the `continuer` function attempts to call methods on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this, [arguments]
