Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat `null` as a valid object, allowing the function to proceed with `null` as if it were an object, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `a` is a string, allowing any non-string value (including objects) to pass through, which could lead to incorrect handling of valid object inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow arrays to be treated as valid inputs, rejecting all other object types, which could lead to loss of functionality for valid object inputs that are not arrays.

DONE.
