  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `places` is not equal to zero, while this code fragment checks if `places` is greater than zero. This could cause the `ceil` method to return a different value if `places` is a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `places` is not equal to zero, while this code fragment checks if `places` is greater than or equal to zero. This could cause the `ceil` method to return a different value if `places` is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `places` is not equal to zero, while this code fragment checks if `places` is not equal to zero and not equal to
