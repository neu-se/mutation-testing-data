  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `type` function on the second element of the `rule` array, which is not the same as calling `type` on the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the `rule` array, which is not the same as returning the result of calling `type` on the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `rule` array, which is not the same as returning the result of calling `type` on the first element.

DONE.
