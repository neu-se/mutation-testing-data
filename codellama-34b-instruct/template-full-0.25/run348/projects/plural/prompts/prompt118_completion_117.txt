  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics", while this new code fragment applies the rule to all words that end in "ics" and adds an "s" to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics", while this new code fragment applies the rule to all words that end in "ics" and replaces the "ics" with "ices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ies') })
```
This would result in
