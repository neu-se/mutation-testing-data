 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is falsy, it will always set `loop` to false, and the function will stop processing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always set `end` to the value of `abort`, potentially stopping the processing of data or not propagating errors correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will force the loop to stop, potentially stopping the processing of data or not propagating errors correctly.

DONE.
