  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method would remove 10 characters from the beginning of the `url` string, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).endsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith` method would check if the `url` string ends with the substring 'https', which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).includes('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method would check if the `url` string contains the substring 'https', which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
