Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the data to the callback instead of the actual `data`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the data by the consumer of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(!end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the `end` value before passing it to the callback, potentially causing the callback to be invoked with an incorrect `end` status, which could lead to unexpected results in the processing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it recursively calls `next` with the same `end` and `cb` parameters, potentially leading to an infinite loop if the conditions for termination are not met, instead of proceeding with the original callback.

DONE.
