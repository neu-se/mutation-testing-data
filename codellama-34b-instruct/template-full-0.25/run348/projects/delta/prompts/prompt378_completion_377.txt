  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta, while this code always returns true if the next operation is a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta, while this code always returns true if the next operation is an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta, while this code always returns true if the next operation is a retain.

DONE.
