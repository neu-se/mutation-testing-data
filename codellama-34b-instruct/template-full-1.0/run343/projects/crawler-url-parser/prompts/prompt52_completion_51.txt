  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` returns a `Url` object with the `auth` property set to `null`, whereas the original code fragment uses the `auth` property to format the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strict` parameter is set to `false`, which means that the parser will not throw an error if the URL is not formatted correctly. In the original code fragment, the `strict` parameter is set to `true`, which means that the parser will throw an error if the URL is not formatted correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, { strict: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strict` parameter is set to `false`, which means that the parser will not throw an error if the URL
