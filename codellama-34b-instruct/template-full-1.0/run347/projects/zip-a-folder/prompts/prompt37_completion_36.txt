  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob()` function, so if `src` is a glob, it will return `false`, and if `src` is not a glob, it will return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(src).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of all the keys in an object, and `.length` returns the number of elements in an array. This code would return the number of keys in the `src` object, which may not be the same as the number of globs it contains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.glob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `glob` property of the `src` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the result of the `isG
