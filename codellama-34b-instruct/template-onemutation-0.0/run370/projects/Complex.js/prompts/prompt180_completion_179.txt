  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if the complex number is infinite, while the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is zero. Using `isInfinite` instead of `isZero` would cause the `pow` method to return a different result for certain inputs.

DONE.
