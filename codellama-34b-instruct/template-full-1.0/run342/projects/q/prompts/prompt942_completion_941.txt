  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array-like object and does not have a `length` property, unlike the original value of `arguments` which is a parameter object that does have a `length` property. If the code that was expecting an array-like object with a `length` property was replaced with `null`, it would likely throw a TypeError when trying to access the `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number and does not have a `length` property, unlike the original value of `arguments` which is a parameter object that does have a `length` property. If the code that was expecting an array-like object with a `length` property was replaced with `0`, it would likely throw a TypeError when trying to access the `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because
