  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to wait for all promises to be rejected before resolving the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to resolve the returned promise immediately if any of the promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to wait for only one promise to be rejected before resolving the returned promise.

DONE.
