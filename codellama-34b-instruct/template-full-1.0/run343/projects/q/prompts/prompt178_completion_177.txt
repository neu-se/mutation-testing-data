  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module2.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not be able to find the correct module and would return a value that is not expected by the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(modules.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not be able to find the correct module and would return a value that is not expected by the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(window.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not be able to find the correct module and would return a value that is not expected by the program.

DONE.
