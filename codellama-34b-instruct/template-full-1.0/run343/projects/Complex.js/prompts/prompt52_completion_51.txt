  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[' really complex']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a property called ' really complex', which does not exist on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(Math.sqrt(b)));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the square root of b, which is positive by definition, and then take the arctangent of the result, which is always between -90 and 90 degrees. The original code fragment, on the other hand, takes the arctangent of b as-is, which can result in values outside of this range.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square b before taking the arctangent, which would result in a different range of values.

DONE.
