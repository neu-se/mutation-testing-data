  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, places || 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the EPSILON constant is never used in the calculation, and the result would always be 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the EPSILON constant is never used in the calculation, and the result would always be 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 0, 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the EPSILON constant is never used in the calculation, and the result would always be 10.

DONE.
