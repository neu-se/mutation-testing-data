 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses 1 as the argument for cosh, instead of the correct value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the real part by 2, which is not equivalent to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the cosine function instead of the cosh function, which are different mathematical operations.

DONE.
