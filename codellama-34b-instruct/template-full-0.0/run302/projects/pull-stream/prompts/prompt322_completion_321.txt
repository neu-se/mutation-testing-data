  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of the return value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(ended, data)` would be called regardless of the return value of `test`. Additionally, the `ended` variable is not defined in the original code, so this change would result in a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb
