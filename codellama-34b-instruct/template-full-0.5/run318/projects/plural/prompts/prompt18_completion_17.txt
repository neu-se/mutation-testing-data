  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to ignore case when matching the pattern in the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match the pattern in the input string across multiple lines.

DONE.
