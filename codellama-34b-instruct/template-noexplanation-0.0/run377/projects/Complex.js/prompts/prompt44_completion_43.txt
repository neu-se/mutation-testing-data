  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `a` and `b` are not equal, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `a` and `b` are equal, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `a` is greater than `b`, which is a different condition than the original behavior.

DONE.
