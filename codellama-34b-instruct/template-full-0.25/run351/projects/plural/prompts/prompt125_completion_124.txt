  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toLowerCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as is, while this new code fragment returns the word in lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as is, while this new code fragment returns the word without its first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b
