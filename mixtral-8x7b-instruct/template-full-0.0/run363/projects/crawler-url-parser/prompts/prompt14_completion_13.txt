 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the entire fragment part (starting with '#') instead of just the part after '#'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.split('#')[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the string at '#' and returns the first part, instead of just removing the part after '#'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.substr(0, currentUrlStr.indexOf('#'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the substring from the beginning of the string to the position of '#', instead of just removing the part after '#'.

DONE.
