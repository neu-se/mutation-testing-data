  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'people'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "person".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'people'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "person".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'people'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "person".

DONE.
