  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while the modified code checks if it has more than one key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while the modified code checks if it has no keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length < 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while the modified code checks if it has fewer than 10
