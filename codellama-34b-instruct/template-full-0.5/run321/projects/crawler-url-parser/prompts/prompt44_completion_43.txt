  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would not be parsed correctly, and the `baseUrl` variable would not be set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` variable would be set to `null`, and the URL would not be parsed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` variable would be set to `undefined`, and the URL would not be parsed correctly.

DONE.
