  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the real part of the number, regardless of whether it is positive or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the imaginary part of the number, regardless of whether it is positive or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the number, regardless of whether it is positive or negative.

DONE.
