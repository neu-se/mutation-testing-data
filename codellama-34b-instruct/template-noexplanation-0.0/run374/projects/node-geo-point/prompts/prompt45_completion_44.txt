  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 1 : r
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it will have the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 0 : r
```
This code fragment will always return 0, regardless of the value of `r`. This is a buggy code fragment that will cause the `calculateDistance` method to always return 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? r : 0
```
This code fragment will return 0 if `r` is greater than 1, and `r` otherwise. This is a buggy code fragment that will cause the `calculateDistance` method to return 0 if the distance is greater than 1, and the distance otherwise.

DONE.
