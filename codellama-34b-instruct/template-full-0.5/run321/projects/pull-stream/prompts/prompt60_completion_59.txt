  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = function (err, cb) {
  if('function' == typeof err)
    cb = err, err = true
  abort = err || true
  if(read) return read(abort, cb || function () {})
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink.abort` function is now defined twice, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = function (err, cb) {
  if('function' == typeof err)
    cb = err, err = true
  abort = err || true
  if(read) return read(abort, cb || function () {})
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink.abort` function is now defined with a different name, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = function (
