  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` argument would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `{}` argument would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, { country: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `{ country: null }` argument would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return an object with a `country` property set to `null` instead of the expected country object.

DONE.
