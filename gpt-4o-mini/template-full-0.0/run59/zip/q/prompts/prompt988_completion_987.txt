Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from a "post" request (which typically implies sending data) to a "get" request (which typically implies retrieving data), potentially altering the intended interaction with the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends an empty array instead of the `nodeArgs`, which means that the callback will not receive any of the intended arguments, likely leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument ("extraArg") to the array being sent, which could change how the receiving function processes the arguments, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

DONE.
