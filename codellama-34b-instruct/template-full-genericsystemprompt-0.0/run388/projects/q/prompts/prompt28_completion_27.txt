  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
