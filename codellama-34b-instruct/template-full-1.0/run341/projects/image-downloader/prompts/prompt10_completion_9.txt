  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now refer to the `src` option, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now refer to the `filename` property of the `dest` option, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now refer to the directory name of the `dest` option, which is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
