  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the string "(module.js:" is present in the stack trace, which would not be the case if the code was modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the string "(node.js:" is present in the stack trace, which would not be the case if the code was modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(main.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the string "(main.js:" is present in the stack trace, which would not be the case if the code was modified.

DONE.
