  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would result in the `if` statement being executed, while the new code fragment would result in the `else` statement being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would result in the `if` statement being executed, while the new code fragment would result in the `else` statement being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would result in the `if` statement being executed, while the new code fragment would result in the `else` statement being executed.

DONE.
