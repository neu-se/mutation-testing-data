  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `read` function. This will likely cause the code to behave differently than expected, as the `nextStream` function is intended to be called as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called with a null error and a function that will be called with the error and data. This will likely cause the code to behave differently than expected, as the `nextStream` function is intended to be called with a stream and a callback.
