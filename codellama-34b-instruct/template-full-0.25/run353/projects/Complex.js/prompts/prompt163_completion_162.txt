  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero, but this replacement code returns `Complex['NAN']` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when the divisor is zero, but this replacement code returns `Complex['INFINITY']` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when the divisor is zero, but this replacement code returns a complex number with both real and imaginary parts equal to zero instead.

DONE.
