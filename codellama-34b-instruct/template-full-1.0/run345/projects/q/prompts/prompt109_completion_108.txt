  Sure, here are three answers for the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop now iterates over the array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.length); i < this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop now iterates over a random selection of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop now iterates over every other element in the array.

DONE.
