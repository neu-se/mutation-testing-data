Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `value` parameter, which means the property will not be set to the intended value, potentially leading to undefined behavior or leaving the property unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"update", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an incorrect operation name ("update" instead of "set"), which may not be recognized by the dispatch method, leading to a failure in setting the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the `key` and `value` parameters, which would attempt to set the property using the value as the key and the key as the value, likely resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
