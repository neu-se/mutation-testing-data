  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved after a specified delay, while `this.dispatch` is a method that sends a message to a value in a future turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved after a specified timeout, while `this.dispatch` is a method that sends a message to a value in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.sendTo
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.sendTo` is a function that sends a message to a value in a future turn, while `this.dispatch` is a method that sends a message to a value in a future turn.

DONE.
