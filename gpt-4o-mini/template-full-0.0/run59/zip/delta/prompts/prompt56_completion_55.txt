Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the constructor to assign the instance's `ops` property to itself, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect initialization of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the constructor to always initialize `this.ops` to an empty array, regardless of the input, thus ignoring any valid `ops` provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to the same outcome as using `null`, causing the constructor to always initialize `this.ops` to an empty array, thus failing to handle valid input correctly.

DONE.
