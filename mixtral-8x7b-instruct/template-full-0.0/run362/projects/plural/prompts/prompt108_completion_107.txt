 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 1 instead of the original word, which can cause tests to fail if the expected result is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase()}
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the word to uppercase, which can cause tests to fail if the expected result is a word in lowercase or camelCase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return rules[0][1](w) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always applies the first rule in the `rules` array, regardless of whether it matches the word or not. This can cause tests to fail if the expected result is different from the first rule's result.

DONE.
