  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` computes the arccosine function, which is the inverse of the cosine function, while `Math.abs` computes the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of the x coordinate of the complex number, which is not always the same as the sine of the complex number itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the complex number itself, which is not always the same as the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
