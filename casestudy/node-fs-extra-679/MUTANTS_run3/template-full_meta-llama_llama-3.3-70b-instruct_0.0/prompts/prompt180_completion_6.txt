Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent => path.dirname(destParent)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition in the if statement, instead of checking if the current directory is the root, it checks if the parent directory of the current directory is the same as the current directory, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the root directory ('/'), which means the condition in the if statement will always be true if the current directory is the root, and the function will stop recursing prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd
```
This would result in different behavior because it gets the current working directory instead of parsing the destParent to get the root directory, which could lead to incorrect results if the current working directory is not the same as the root directory of the destParent.

DONE.
