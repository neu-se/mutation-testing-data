  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform a promise that expects an empty array into a promise that expects an array with at least one value, which could lead to a runtime error if the promise is not fulfilled with an array of that length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform a promise that expects a non-empty array into a promise that expects an empty array, which could lead to a runtime error if the promise is fulfilled with a non-empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform a promise that expects an empty array into a promise that expects an array with a length greater than zero, which could lead to a runtime error if the promise is fulfilled with an empty array.

DONE.
