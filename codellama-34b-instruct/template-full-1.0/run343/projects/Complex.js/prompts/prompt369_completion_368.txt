  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * cos(b) * sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.cos(b)` instead of `cos(b)`, and the constant `2` is added to the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(b) * sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.cos(b)` instead of `sin(b)`, and the constant `2` is multiplied instead of added to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(a) * cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sin(a)` instead of `cos(a)`, and the constant `2` is multiplied instead of added to the result.

DONE.
