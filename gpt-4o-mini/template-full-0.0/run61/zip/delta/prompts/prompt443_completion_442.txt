Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a substring of length 1 from the `insert` property, regardless of the actual length of the string, potentially leading to incorrect data being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty substring from the `insert` property, effectively ignoring the content of the `insert` field and returning an empty object instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to return a substring that is one character longer than the actual length of the `insert` property, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or unexpected results if the length of the string is equal to or less than `length`.

DONE.
