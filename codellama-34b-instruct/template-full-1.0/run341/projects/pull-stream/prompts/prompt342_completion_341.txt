  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` is the logical negation of `abort`, so the code within the `if` statement would be executed if `abort` is `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || null
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort || null` is the logical OR operation on `abort` and `null`, which would evaluate to `null` if `abort` is `false` and to `abort` if `abort` is `true`. In the original code, the value of `abort` is used directly within the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof abort === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof abort === 'function'` is a type check that checks if `abort` is a function. In the original code, `abort` is a boolean
