  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve` method resolves a relative URL against a base URL, whereas the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse` method to parse the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl.resolve(parsedUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method parses a URL string, whereas the original code fragment uses the `URL.resolve` method to resolve a relative URL against a base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl.href + parsedUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method parses a URL string, whereas the original code fragment uses the `URL.resolve` method to resolve a relative URL against a base URL.

DONE.
