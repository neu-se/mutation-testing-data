  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 1, causing the `splice` method to insert the `newOp` object at the wrong position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented by 1, causing the `splice` method to insert the `newOp` object at the wrong position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would always be 0, causing the `splice` method to always insert the `newOp` object at the beginning of the `ops` array, instead of at the correct position based on the current `index` value.

DONE.
