  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) || value.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also consider promises that are fulfilled as "near" values, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) && value.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider promises that are rejected as "near" values, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any object with a `then` method as "near", which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
