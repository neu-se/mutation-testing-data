  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method would always return 0, causing the loop to iterate infinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method would always return -1, causing the loop to never iterate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method would return a value that is one less than the actual length, causing the loop to iterate one fewer times than expected.

DONE.
