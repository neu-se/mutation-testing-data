  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation in the delta, which could cause the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation in the other delta, which could cause the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation in the delta, which could cause the resulting delta to be incorrect.

DONE.
