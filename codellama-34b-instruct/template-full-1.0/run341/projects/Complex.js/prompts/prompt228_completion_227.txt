  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(r - a)` returns the square root of the difference between `r` and `a`, which is not the same as the square root of the sum of `r` and `a` returned by `Math.sqrt(r + a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(r + a)` returns the absolute value of the sum of `r` and `a`, which is not the same as the square root of the sum of `r` and `a` returned by `Math.sqrt(r + a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(r - a)` returns the exponential function of the difference between `r` and `a`, which is not
