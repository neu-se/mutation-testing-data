  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, so `typeof newOp.attributes` would evaluate to `"object"` and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, so `typeof newOp.attributes` would evaluate to `"object"` and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, so `typeof newOp.attributes` would evaluate to `"object"` and the `if` statement would be executed.

DONE.
