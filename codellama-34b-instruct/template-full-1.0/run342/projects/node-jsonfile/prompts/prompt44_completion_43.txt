  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the reviver function is not being called with the correct argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"options"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "options" is not a valid argument for the JSON.parse() method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a valid argument for the JSON.parse() method.

DONE.
