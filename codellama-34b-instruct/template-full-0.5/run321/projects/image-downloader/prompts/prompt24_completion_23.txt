  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(path.extname(options.dest), '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.extname(options.dest)` to get the file extension of the destination path, while the new code fragment uses `options.dest.replace(path.extname(options.dest), '')` to remove the file extension from the destination path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split(path.sep).pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.basename(options.dest)` to get the file name of the destination path, while the new code fragment uses `options.dest.split(path.sep).pop()` to get the file name of the destination path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.dirname(options.
