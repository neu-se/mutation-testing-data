  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being incremented by 1, which could cause the `once` function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being decremented by 1, which could cause the `once` function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which means that the `once` function would not be called, even if the `end` variable is truthy.

DONE.
