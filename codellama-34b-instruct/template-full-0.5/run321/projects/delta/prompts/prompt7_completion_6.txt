  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.filter(attr => attr[key] === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return a new array containing only the attributes that have a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment would return all attributes, including those with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.map(attr => attr[key] === null ? null : attr[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return a new array containing the attributes that have a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment would return all attributes, including those with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.reduce((copy, attr) => {
  if (attr[key] === null) {
    copy[attr] = null;
  }
  return copy;
}, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method
