  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `err` and `acc`, while the new code fragment only checks for `acc`. If `err` is not `null`, the original code would call the callback with `err`, while the new code would call the callback with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `err` and `acc`, while the new code fragment only checks for `err`. If `acc` is not `null`, the original code would call the callback with `err, acc`, while the new code would call the callback with `err, null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
