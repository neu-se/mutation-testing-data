  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `otherIter.peekLength` as a number, but the replacement code uses `otherIter.peekLength()` as a function call, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `otherIter.peekLength` as a number, but the replacement code adds 1 to the value returned by `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could potentially result in a different minimum value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `otherIter.peekLength` as a number, but the replacement code subtracts 1 from the value returned by `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could potentially result in a different minimum value.
