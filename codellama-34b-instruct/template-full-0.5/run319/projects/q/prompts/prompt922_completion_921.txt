  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise, while the replaced fragment would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise, while the replaced fragment would notify the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise, while the replaced fragment would do nothing.

DONE.
