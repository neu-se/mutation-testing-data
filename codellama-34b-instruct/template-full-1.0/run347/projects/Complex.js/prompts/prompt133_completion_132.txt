  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isInfinite` method, which is not defined in the original code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `z` is not equal to the value `Infinity`, which is not the same as checking if `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `isInfinite` property of `z` is truthy, which is not the same as checking if `z` is infinite.

DONE.
