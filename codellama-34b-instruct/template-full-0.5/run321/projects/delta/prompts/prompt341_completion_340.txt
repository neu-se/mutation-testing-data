  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` is a function that returns the next element in the iterator, whereas `next` is a property that returns the next element in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(2)` would return the next two elements in the iterator, whereas `next` would return the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(1, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(1, true)` would return the next element in the iterator, but would also skip over any elements that are marked as "deleted".

DONE.
