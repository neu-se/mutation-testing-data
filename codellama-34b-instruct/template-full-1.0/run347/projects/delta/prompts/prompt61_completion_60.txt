  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attributes !== null &&
  typeof attributes === 'object' &&
  Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the `attributes` object to be not null and not an object if it had zero properties, which would cause the `insert` method to incorrectly execute the branch related to the attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attributes !== null &&
  typeof attributes === 'object' &&
  Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the `attributes` object to be not null and not an object if it had negative properties, which would cause the `insert` method to incorrectly execute the branch related to the attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attributes !== null &&
  typeof attributes === 'object' &&
  Object.keys(attributes).length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider
