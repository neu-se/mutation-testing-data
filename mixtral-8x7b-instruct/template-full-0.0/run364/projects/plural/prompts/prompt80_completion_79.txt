 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different plural form for the word 'goose'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 'gooses' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different plural form for the word 'goose'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'moose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a special case for the word 'goose' and its plural form.

DONE.
