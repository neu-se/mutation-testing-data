  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `this['re']` is the real part. By changing the placeholder to `this['im']`, the code would be testing the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number would change its value, and the code would be testing a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(this['im'])` is a trigonometric function of the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change its value.

DONE.
