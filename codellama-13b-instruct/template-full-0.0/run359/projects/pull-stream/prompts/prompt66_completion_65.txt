  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is equal to `true`, while the buggy code fragment checks if `end` is equal to `null`. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `end` is `null`, but not `true`.
