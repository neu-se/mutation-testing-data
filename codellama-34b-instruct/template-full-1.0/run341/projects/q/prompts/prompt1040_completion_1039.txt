  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` creates a new deferred object with a null value, whereas `Q.defer` is a factory function that returns a new deferred object. If the test suite is not properly checking for null values, this change may result in a failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(undefined)` creates a new deferred object with an undefined value, whereas `Q.defer` is a factory function that returns a new deferred object. If the test suite is not properly checking for undefined values, this change may result in a failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(NaN)` creates a new deferred object with a NaN value, whereas `Q.de
