  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes characters from the end of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the URL contains whitespace at the end.

DONE.
