  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `thisIter` object, which would advance the iterator and return the next value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `previous()` method on the `thisIter` object, which would move the iterator backward and return the previous value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next value in the iterator without advancing it.

DONE.
