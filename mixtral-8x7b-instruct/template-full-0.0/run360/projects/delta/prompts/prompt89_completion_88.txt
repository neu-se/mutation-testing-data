 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this change checks if it is not `undefined`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when `newOp.attributes` is `null` or a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof newOp.attributes === 'undefined'
```

This would cause the following lines to never be executed, potentially causing issues if the `insert` or `retain` properties are used with specific attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
newOp.hasOwnProperty('attributes')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this change checks if the `attributes
