  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `baseOpData`, potentially causing the `invert` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `baseOpData`, potentially causing the `invert` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `baseOpData`, potentially causing the `invert` method to return a different result.

DONE.
