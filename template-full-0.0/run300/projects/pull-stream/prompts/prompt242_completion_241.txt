  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, but this replacement would always pass `null` as the second argument to `cb`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `data` as the second argument to `cb`, but this replacement would pass the length of `data` instead, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `data` as the second argument to `cb`, but this replacement would pass the first element of `data` instead, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
