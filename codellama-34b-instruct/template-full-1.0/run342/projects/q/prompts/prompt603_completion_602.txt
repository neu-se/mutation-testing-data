  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Dummy error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.promise` to be rejected with an error, which could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to throw an unhandled rejection error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.promise` to be resolved with `undefined`, which could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, rather than the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("dummy value")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.promise` to be resolved with the string "dummy value", which could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that resolves to a different value than expected.

DONE.
