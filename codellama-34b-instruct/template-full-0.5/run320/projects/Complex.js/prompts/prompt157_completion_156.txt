  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a * z['re'], b * z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the expected result of the power function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a + z['re'], b + z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the expected result of the power function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a * z['re'] + b * z['im'], a * z['im'] + b * z['re']);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, with the real and imaginary parts swapped, instead of the expected result of the power function.

DONE.
