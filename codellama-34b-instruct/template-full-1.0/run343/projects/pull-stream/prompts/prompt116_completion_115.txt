  Okay, let's get started with the mutation testing.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `acc, null`.

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with both the `err` argument and the `acc` argument. However, in the mutated code, only the `acc` argument is passed to `cb`. This change could potentially cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than it would have been in the original code, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `err, null`.

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with both the `err` argument and the `acc` argument. However, in the mutated code, only the `err` argument is passed to `cb`.
