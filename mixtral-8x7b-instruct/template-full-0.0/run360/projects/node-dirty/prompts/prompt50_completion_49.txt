 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the internal `_data` Map, bypassing any potential caching or other behavior implemented by the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.set(key, val, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value instead of retrieving it, potentially causing unexpected side effects if the `val` or `cb` variables contain unexpected values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.rm(key, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the key-value pair instead of retrieving the value, potentially causing unexpected side effects if the `cb` variable contains an unexpected value.

DONE.
