  Sure! Here are the three options for mutating the PLACEHOLDER in the code snippet provided:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `void`:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(object).dispatch(op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` means nothing, it will just ignore the result of the dispatch call and not perform the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this`:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this).dispatch(op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, so it will perform the dispatch operation on the current object, not the one passed in as a parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with a different object:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(someOtherObject).dispatch(op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the dispatch operation is performed on a different object than the one passed in as a parameter, which could lead to unexpected results.
