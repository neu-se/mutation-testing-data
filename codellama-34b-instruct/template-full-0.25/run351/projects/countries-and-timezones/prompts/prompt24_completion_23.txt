  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` value would be incremented by 1, which could affect the calculation of the `utcOffsetStr` and `dstOffsetStr` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be used instead of the `utcOffset` value, which could affect the calculation of the `utcOffsetStr` and `dstOffsetStr` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs()` function would be applied to the `utcOffset` value, which could affect the calculation of the `utcOffsetStr` and `dstOffsetStr` properties.

DONE.
