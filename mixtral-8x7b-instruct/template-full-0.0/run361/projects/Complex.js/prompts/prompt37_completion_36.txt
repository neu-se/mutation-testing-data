 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the logHypot function would return Math.log(0) when b is 0, which is negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the logHypot function would return Math.log(1) when b is 0, which is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logHypot function would return Math.log(Math.abs(b)) when b is 0, which is 0.

DONE.
