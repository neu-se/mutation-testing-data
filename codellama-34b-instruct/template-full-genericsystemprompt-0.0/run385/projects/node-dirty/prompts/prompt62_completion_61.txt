  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with an error object, which would cause the read stream to emit an error event, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `destroy`, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed without emitting an error event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a null argument, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed without emitting an error event, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `destroy`, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed without emitting an error event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed
