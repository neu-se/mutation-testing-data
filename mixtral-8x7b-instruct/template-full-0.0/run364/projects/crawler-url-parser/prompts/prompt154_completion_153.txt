 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it will match any string ending with a slash, instead of only matching the last part of the URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^\/]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it will match the last part of the URL path, but it will not include the trailing slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^\/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it will match one or more characters that are not a slash at the end of the URL path, which will also exclude the trailing slash.

DONE.
