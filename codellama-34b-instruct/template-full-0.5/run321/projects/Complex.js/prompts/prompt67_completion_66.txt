  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the length of the array is exactly 2, while the mutated code is checking if the length is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the length of the array is exactly 2, while the mutated code is checking if the length is greater than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the length of the array is exactly 2, while the mutated code is checking if the length is exactly 1.

DONE.
