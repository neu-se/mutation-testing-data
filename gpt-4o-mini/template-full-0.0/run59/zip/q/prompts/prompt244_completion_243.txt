Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ state: "fulfilled", value: resolvedPromise.value }
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `resolvedPromise` has a `value` property, which may not exist, leading to a potential runtime error or incorrect state representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ state: "rejected", reason: resolvedPromise.reason }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly assumes that `resolvedPromise` has a `reason` property, which would misrepresent the state of the promise if it is not rejected, leading to confusion in the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ state: "pending", progress: progressListeners.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new property `progress` that counts the number of progress listeners, which is not part of the original promise state representation and could mislead users about the promise's status.

DONE.
