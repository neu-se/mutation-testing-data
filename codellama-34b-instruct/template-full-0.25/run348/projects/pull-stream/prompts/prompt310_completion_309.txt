  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the `test` function, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is short-circuiting the evaluation of the `test` function, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is short-circuiting the evaluation of the `test` function, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `data`.

DONE.
