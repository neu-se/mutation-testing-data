  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the `options.dest` path, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the parent directory of the `options.dest` path, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base name of the `options.dest` path, which may not be intended.

DONE.
