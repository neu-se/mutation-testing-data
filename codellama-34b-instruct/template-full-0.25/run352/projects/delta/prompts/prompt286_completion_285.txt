  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the code to skip over the first character of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the code to start at the wrong position in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 2, which would cause the code to skip over the first two characters of the string.

DONE.
