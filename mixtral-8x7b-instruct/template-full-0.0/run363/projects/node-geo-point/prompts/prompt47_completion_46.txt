 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the bearing as if the starting point is at the equator, regardless of the actual latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the current object instead of the latitude of the first point, which would cause incorrect calculations when the current object's latitude is different from the first point's latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the calculation of the bearing, making the results unpredictable and unreliable.

DONE.
