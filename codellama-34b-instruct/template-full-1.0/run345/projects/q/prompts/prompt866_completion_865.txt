  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called with the `deferred` object as an argument, so the `then` method would not be able to use it to resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with the `deferred` object as an argument, but it is not the correct argument for the `then` method to use. The `then` method would still be called, but it would not be able to use the `deferred` object to resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with an empty object as an argument, so the `then` method would not be able to use it to resolve the promise.

DONE.
