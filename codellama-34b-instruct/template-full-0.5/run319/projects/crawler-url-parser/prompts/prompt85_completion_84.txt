  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because `html()` returns the HTML contents of the element, while `text()` returns the text content. In this case, `html()` would return the HTML code inside the `<a>` tag, which may include other elements or attributes, while `text()` would return only the text content of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').trim();

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop('href').trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop('href')` returns the value of the `href` property, while `text
