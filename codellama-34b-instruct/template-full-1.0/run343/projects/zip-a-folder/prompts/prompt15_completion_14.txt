  Based on the given code snippet, the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with different code fragments to analyze and test the behavior of getter methods in TypeScript. The below given code fragments are the possible answers: 

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```{error: 'error', level: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}```
This would result in different behavior because the new error object would be different from the previous one, and it would have a level value of COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed, which would cause error values to be returned correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```{level: COMPRESSION_LEVEL['medium']}```
This would result in different behavior because the level value in the error object would be updated to COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium, which would result in high compression level not being applied to the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```{error: 'error', level: COMPRESSION_LE
