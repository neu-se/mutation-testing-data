  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to always return the same value, regardless of the input points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to always return the same value, regardless of the input points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude + point2.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to always return a different value, depending on the input points.

DONE.
