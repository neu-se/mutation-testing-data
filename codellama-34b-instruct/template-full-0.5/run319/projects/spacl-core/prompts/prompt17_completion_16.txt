  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `compile` function with the `spec` argument, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.0');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `compile` function with the `spec` and `version` arguments, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.1');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `compile` function with the `spec` and `version` arguments, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
