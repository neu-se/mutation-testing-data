 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, or -1 if no match is found, instead of the index of the start of the string as `indexOf` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split('\n').length
