  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is an object. This would cause the `diff` function to behave differently when `b` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is not null. This would cause the `diff` function to behave differently when `b` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is not undefined. This would cause the `diff` function to behave differently when `b` is undefined.

DONE.
