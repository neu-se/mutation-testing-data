  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone instead of the timezone object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the UTC offset of the timezone instead of the timezone object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.abbreviation
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the abbreviation of the timezone instead of the timezone object itself.

DONE.
