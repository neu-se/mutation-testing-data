  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would remove the first character of the policy name, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name is used as a key in the `Map`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the policy name, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name is used as a key in the `Map`.

DONE.
