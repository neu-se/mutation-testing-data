  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `isInternalFrame` function always return `false`, causing the stack trace to be filtered incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `isInternalFrame` function always return `false`, causing the stack trace to be filtered incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lineNumber >= qEndingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `isInternalFrame` function always return `true`, causing the stack trace to be filtered incorrectly.

DONE.
