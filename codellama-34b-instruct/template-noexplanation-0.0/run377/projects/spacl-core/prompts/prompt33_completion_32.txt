  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the array returned by `split()`, and then accesses the first element of the reversed array using `[0]`. This has the same behavior as the original code fragment, which accesses the last element of the array using `[-1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[1];
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the array returned by `split()`, and then accesses the second element of the reversed array using `[1]`. This has the same behavior as the original code fragment, which accesses the last element of the array using `[-1]`.
