Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic from retrieving the length of the current operation to retrieving its type, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations based on their type rather than their length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it switches the context from the current iterator (`thisIter`) to the other iterator (`otherIter`), potentially causing the code to use the length of operations from the other delta instead of the current one, leading to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the length to be at least 1, which could lead to unintended behavior when the actual length is 0, potentially causing the code to process operations that should not be processed.

DONE.
