  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `mapper`, so if `mapper` is a function, it would return `false` instead of the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `mapper`, which would change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would call the function `mapper` with no arguments, which would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
