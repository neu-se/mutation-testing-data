  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is not an array, so `slice()` would not work on it, and `[].slice.call()` is used to convert `arguments` to an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype` is a more explicit reference to the `slice()` method, and `Array.prototype.slice.call()` is used to convert `arguments` to an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...arguments].slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `...arguments` is used to spread the `arguments` object into an array, and `slice(1)` is used to remove the first element of the array.

DONE.
