  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.attributes = {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `attributes` property of each `Op` object in the `ops` array to an empty object, which would cause the `isEqual` comparison in the `push` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.attributes = null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `attributes` property of each `Op` object in the `ops` array to `null`, which would cause the `isEqual` comparison in the `push` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.attributes = undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `attributes` property of each `Op` object in the `ops` array to `undefined`, which would cause the `isEqual` comparison in
