 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `i` to the length of the `rules` array instead of 0, causing the loop to not execute since `i--` would immediately make `i` less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = rules.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `i` to the length of the `rules` array and then immediately decrements it, causing the loop to not execute since `i` is already less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const i = rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` as a constant, which would cause an error when trying to increment or decrement it in the loop.

DONE.
