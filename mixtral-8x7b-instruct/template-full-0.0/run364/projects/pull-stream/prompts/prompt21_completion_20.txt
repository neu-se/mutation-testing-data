 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is being returned directly, instead of calling the `pull` function with `read` as the argument. This change would bypass the transformation of arguments and the recursive call to `pull`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return read; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `read` variable in an anonymous function, changing the behavior of the returned function. The original code calls `pull` with `read` as the argument, while this change would return a function that returns `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind(null, read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Function.prototype.bind` method to create a new function with `pull` as the target and `read` as the first argument. This change would cause the returned function to always use the initial `read` value
