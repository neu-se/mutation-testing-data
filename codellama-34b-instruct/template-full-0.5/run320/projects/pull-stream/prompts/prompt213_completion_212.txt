  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a non-null value, while `null` is a null value. If the code fragment is replaced with `null`, the `abortCb` function will not be called, even if `aborted` is true, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a defined variable, while `undefined` is an undefined variable. If the code fragment is replaced with `undefined`, the `abortCb` function will not be called, even if `aborted` is true, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a boolean value, while `false` is a boolean value. If the code fragment is replaced with `false`, the `abortCb` function will not be called, even
