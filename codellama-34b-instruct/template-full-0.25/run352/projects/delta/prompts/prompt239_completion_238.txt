  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, while `length + 1` would return the number of characters plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, while `length - 1` would return the number of characters minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, while `length * 2` would return the number of characters multiplied by two.

DONE.
