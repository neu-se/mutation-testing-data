Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` will reject if any of the promises in the iterable are rejected, whereas the original code using `Q` allows for progress notifications without rejecting the entire chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would call the `progressed` callback only when the promise is fulfilled, ignoring progress notifications entirely, while the original code allows for progress notifications regardless of the promise's fulfillment state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` immediately returns a rejected promise, which would not allow for any progress notifications to be sent, whereas the original code allows for progress notifications to be sent even if the promise is not fulfilled.

DONE.
