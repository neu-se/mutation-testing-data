  Sure, here are my answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the basis regardless of the index, which would cause the reduce function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index, which would cause the reduce function to skip every other element in the array and return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly pick an index from the array, which would cause the reduce function to return a random result.

DONE.
