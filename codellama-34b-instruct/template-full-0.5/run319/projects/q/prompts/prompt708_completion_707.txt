  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, which would create a new array containing all the arguments, instead of just the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to the `array_slice` function, which would create a new array containing only the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, starting from the second argument, which would create a new array containing all the arguments except the first one.

DONE.
