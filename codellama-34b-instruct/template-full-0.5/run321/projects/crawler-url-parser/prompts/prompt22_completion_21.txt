  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with `http://`, while this replacement replaces it with `https://`, which could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the `https` protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with `http://`, while this replacement replaces it with `ftp://`, which could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the `ftp` protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with `http://`, while this replacement replaces it with `file://`, which could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the `file` protocol.

DONE.
