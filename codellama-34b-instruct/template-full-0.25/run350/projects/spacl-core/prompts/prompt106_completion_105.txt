  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.doesNotMatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `doesNotMatch` is a different method than `matches`, and it would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, even if the policy does match the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to be called with the `ctx` argument, which is not present in the original code. This could cause the method to return a different value, depending on the implementation of the `matches` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to be called with the `ctx` argument, which is not present in the original code. This could cause the method to return a different value, depending on the implementation of the `matches` method.

DONE.
