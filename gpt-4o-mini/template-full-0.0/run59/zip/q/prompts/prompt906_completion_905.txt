Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow both `null` and `undefined` to pass through, whereas the original check only disallowed `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined && callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to proceed if `callback` is defined and not `null`, which is the opposite of the original intent to throw an error when `callback` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an error if `callback` is not a function, allowing other non-function values (like strings or numbers) to pass through without error, which is not the original intent.

DONE.
