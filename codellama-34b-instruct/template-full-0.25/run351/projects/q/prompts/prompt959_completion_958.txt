  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments, 2)` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from index 2 onwards, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from index 2 onwards, but with the first element of the array being `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(2)` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from index 2 onwards, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from index 2 onwards, but with the first element of the array being `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
