  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(reject(result.value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause an error to be thrown, resulting in a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a fulfilled promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` is an operator that evaluates the given expression and returns `undefined`, whereas `Q` returns a fulfilled promise with the given value.

DONE.
