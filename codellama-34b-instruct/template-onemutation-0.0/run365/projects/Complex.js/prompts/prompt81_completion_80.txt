  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is a minus sign, while the new code fragment checks if it is a plus sign. This would cause the parser to interpret the input string differently and potentially return a different result.

DONE.
