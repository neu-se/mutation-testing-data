  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` returns a new function that is bound to the current `this` value, whereas `this.dispatch` would be called with the `this` value of the `Promise.prototype.bind` method, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(null)` returns a new function that is bound to `null` instead of the current `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(() => {})` returns a new function that is bound to the return value of the arrow function `() => {}`, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
