  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.tail.get("head");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the `end.tail` promise immediately, while the new code fragment would resolve it only when the `head` property of the `end` object is accessed. This could cause the `get` method to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
