  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function would return `true` when the two values are not equal, whereas the original `isEqual` function would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would return `true` when the two values are equal, whereas the original `isNotEqual` function would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function would return `true` when the two values are not equal, whereas the original `isEqual` function would return `false`.

DONE.
