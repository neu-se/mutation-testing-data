  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because if `arguments.length` is greater than 2, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if the `acc` variable is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because if `arguments.length` is less than 2, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, even if the `acc` variable is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `acc` is not undefined, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if `arguments.length` is not 2.

DONE.
