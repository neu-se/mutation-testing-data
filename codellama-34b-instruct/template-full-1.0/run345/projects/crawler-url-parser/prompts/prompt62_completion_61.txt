  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.host` would return the hostname of the URL, while `parsedUrl` would return the entire URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.protocol` would return the protocol of the URL, while `parsedUrl` would return the entire URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.path` would return the path portion of the URL, while `parsedUrl` would return the entire URL object.

DONE.
