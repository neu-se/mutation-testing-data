 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting plural form for words ending in 'y' would be incorrect. The original code fragment `w.length - 2` correctly accounts for the length of 'ies' or 'es' that will be appended, while `w.length - 1` would result in an incorrect plural form for words like 'soliloquy'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.substr(w.length - 1, 1) === 'y' ? w.slice(0, -1) + 'ies' : w + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for words ending in 'y' would not consider whether the letter before the 'y' is a consonant or not. This would result in incorrect plural forms for words like 'cherry' and 'soliloquy'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
