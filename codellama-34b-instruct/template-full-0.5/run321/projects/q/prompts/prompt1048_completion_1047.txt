  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is the opposite of `Q.reject`, and would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and reject it, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject(new Error("Custom error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and reject it with a custom error message, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the original code.

DONE.
