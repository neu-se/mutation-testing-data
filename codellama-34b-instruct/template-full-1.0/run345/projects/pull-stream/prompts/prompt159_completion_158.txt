  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `_value + 1` is a different value than `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `_value * 2` is a different value than `_value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as the original value of `_value`.

DONE.
