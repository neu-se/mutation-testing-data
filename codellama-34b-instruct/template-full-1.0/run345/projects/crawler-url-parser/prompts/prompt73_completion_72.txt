  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the src attribute is used to specify the URL of an image or other media, whereas the href attribute is used to specify the URL of a link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'textContent'
```
This would result in different behavior because textContent returns the text content of an element, including any whitespace, whereas href returns the URL of a link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'innerHTML'
```
This would result in different behavior because innerHTML returns the HTML content of an element, including any child elements, whereas href returns the URL of a link.

DONE.
