  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "PLACEHOLDER" would be passed as an argument to the `definition` function, instead of the original code fragment which was `definition`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would be passed as an argument to the `definition` function, instead of the original code fragment which was `definition`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would be passed as an argument to the `definition` function, instead of the original code fragment which was `definition`.

DONE.
