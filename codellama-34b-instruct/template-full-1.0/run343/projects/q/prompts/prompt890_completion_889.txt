  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q().nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty promise, regardless of the callback's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the callback individually, rather than as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(defer()).nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise with a TypeError, regardless of the callback's behavior.

DONE.
