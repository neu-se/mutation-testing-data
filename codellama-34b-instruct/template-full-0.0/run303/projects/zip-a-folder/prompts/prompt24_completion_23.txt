  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tar` method is not defined in the `archiver` module, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` method is not defined in the `archiver` module, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"gzip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` method is not defined in the `archiver` module, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
