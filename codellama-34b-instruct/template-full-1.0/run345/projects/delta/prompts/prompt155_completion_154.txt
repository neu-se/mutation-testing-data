  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `other` Delta's `ops` array, regardless of whether `otherIter` has a next operation or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the next operation in `otherIter` rather than whether `otherIter` has a next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in `otherIter` rather than a boolean value indicating whether `otherIter` has a next operation.

DONE.
