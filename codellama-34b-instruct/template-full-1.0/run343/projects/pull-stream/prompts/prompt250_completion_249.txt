  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when `read` is called with `abort`, the original code fragment passed the `cb` function as the second argument, which is the callback function that is called when `read` is finished. However, if `undefined` is passed instead, `read` will not have a callback function to call when it is finished, which could cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when `read` is called with `abort`, the original code fragment passed the `cb` function as the second argument, which is the callback function that is called when `read` is finished. However, if `null` is passed instead, `read` will not have a callback function to call when it is finished, which could cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.

```
function() {}
