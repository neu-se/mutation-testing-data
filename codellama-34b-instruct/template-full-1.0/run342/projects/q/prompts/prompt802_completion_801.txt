  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the promise instead of the rejection reason to the onUnhandledError callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null instead of the rejection reason to the onUnhandledError callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass undefined instead of the rejection reason to the onUnhandledError callback.

DONE.
