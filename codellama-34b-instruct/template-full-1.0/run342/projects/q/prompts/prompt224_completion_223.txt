  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(Promise.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object that inherits from `Promise.prototype`, rather than an object that is an instance of `Promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        resolve(messages);
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with an array of all the messages that have been sent to the deferred object, rather than a promise that resolves with the value that was passed to the `Q` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object that does not inherit from any other object, rather than an object that inherits from `Promise.prototype`.

DONE.
