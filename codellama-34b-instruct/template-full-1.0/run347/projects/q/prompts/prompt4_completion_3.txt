  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a function, while this option returns `null`, which would cause errors in the subsequent code that relies on the returned function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER was replaced with throw new Error()");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not throw an error, while this option throws an error with a custom message, which would cause the promise to be rejected, potentially leading to different behavior in the subsequent code that handles the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(() => {
    throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER was replaced with throw new Error()");
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not throw an error, while this option throws an error with a custom message, which would cause the promise to be rejected, potentially leading to different behavior in the subsequent code that handles the promise.
