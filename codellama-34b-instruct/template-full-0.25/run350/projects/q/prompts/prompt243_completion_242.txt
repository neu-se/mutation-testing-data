  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy and `false` if the operand is truthy. In this case, `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, which is truthy, so the resulting expression would be `false` even if the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the operands. In this case, `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, which is not `undefined`, so the resulting expression would be `false` even if the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property of a promise object is set to "ful
