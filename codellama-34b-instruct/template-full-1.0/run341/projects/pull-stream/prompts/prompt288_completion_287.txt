  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is always passed as `null`, even when the `read` function returns data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is always incremented by 1, even when the `read` function returns an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is always applied to the `data` variable, even when the `read` function returns an error.

DONE.
