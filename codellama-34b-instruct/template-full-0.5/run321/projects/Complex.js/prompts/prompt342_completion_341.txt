  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the function to produce different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `b` is a different variable. This change would cause the function to produce different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `sin(a)` is a function call that computes the sine of `a`. This change would cause the function to produce different output for the same input.

DONE.
