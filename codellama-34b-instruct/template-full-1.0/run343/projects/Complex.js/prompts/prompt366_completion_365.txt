  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is evaluated once, while the new code fragment `a + 1` is evaluated twice. This small change can cause unexpected results in some cases, especially if the function is used in a critical section of code that relies on the expected behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is evaluated once, while the new code fragment `a - 1` is evaluated twice. This small change can cause unexpected results in some cases, especially if the function is used in a critical section of code that relies on the expected behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is used in a different context than `b - 1`. The new code fragment `b - 1
