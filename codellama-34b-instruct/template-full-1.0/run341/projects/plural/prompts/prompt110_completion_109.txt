  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.join | games.join | illnesses.join | misc.join
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code concatenates the arrays into a single array before joining them with the `|` character, while this code joins the arrays separately and then concatenates the result with the `|` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{clothes, games, illnesses, misc}.join
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code joins each array individually before concatenating them with spaces, while this code joins the arrays as a single object with the `join` method, which puts the brackets and commas between the arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes | games | illnesses | misc.join
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code concatenates the arrays with spaces, while this code joins them with pipes.

DONE.
