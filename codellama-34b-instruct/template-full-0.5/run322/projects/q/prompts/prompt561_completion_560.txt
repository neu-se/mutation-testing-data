  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks if the given value is an instance of the `StopIteration` class, which is not the case for the `exception` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks if the given value is an instance of the `StopIteration` class, which is not the case for the `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception.value.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks if the given value is an instance of the `StopIteration` class, which is not the case for the `exception.value.message` string.

DONE.
