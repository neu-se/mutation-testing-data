  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a
different result when `a` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, -a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has
a different result when `a` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has
a different result when `a` is 0.

DONE.
