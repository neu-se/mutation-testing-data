  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index + length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the base index plus the length of the slice, while this new code returns the index plus the length of the slice plus the length of the slice. This would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the base index plus the length of the slice, while this new code returns the base index plus the length of the slice plus the length of the slice. This would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the base index plus the length of the slice, while this new code returns the base index plus the length of the slice minus one. This
