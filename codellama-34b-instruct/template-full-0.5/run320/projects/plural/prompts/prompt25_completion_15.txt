  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index, whereas `w.substr` returns a substring of `w` starting from the given index with the given length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` returns a substring of `w` starting from the given index with the given length, whereas `w.substr` returns a substring of `w` starting from the given index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of `w` starting from the given index with the given length, whereas `w.substr` returns a substring of `w` starting from the given index.

DONE.
