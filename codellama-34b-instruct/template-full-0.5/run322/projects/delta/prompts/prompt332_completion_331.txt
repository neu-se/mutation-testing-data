  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different method than `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may have different logic or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is now being passed to `AttributeMap.invert`, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is now being passed to `AttributeMap.invert` with a negated value, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
