  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ics$/i` matches words that end with "ics", but the replacement function returns the word unchanged, so the plural form would be the same as the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ics$/i` matches words that end with "ics", but the replacement function returns the word with "ices" appended to the end, so the plural form would be different from the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ies') })
```
This would result in different behavior
