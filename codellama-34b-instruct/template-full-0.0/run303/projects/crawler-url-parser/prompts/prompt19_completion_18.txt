  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the base URL with "https" instead of "http", which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the base URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the base URL with "ftp" instead of "http" or "https", which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

DONE.
