  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an error with the code 'ENOENT' would not be caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because an error with the code 'ENOENT' would not be caught.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ^= 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because an error with the code 'ENOENT' would not be caught.

DONE.
