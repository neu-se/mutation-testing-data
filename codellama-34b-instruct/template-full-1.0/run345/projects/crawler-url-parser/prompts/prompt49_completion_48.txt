  Thank you for the question. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse('http://not-a-valid-url')
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL passed to `URL.parse` is not a valid URL, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, '#anchor')
```
This would result in different behavior because the fragment identifier '#anchor' is not a valid URL, which would cause the function to return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is not a valid URL, which would cause the function to return `null`.

DONE.
