  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = otherIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current op in the other delta, rather than the length of the current op in the this delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current op in the this delta, rather than the length of the current op in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the minimum of the length of the current op in the this delta and the length of the current op in the other delta, rather than the length of the current op in the other delta.

DONE.
