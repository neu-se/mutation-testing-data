 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from "OR" to "AND", meaning that the multiplication result would only be "Infinity" if both the current complex number and the input complex number are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns "Infinity", regardless of the input complex number, which is not the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity || z['re'] === Infinity || this['im'] === Infinity || z['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the real or imaginary parts of both complex numbers are infinite, rather than checking if either complex number is infinite as a whole.

DONE.
