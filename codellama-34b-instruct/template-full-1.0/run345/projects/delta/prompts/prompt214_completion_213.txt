  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the second operation in the other delta, rather than the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the last operation in the other delta, rather than the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the concat() method to return a delta with only the current delta's operations, rather than adding the other delta's operations to the end of it.

DONE.
