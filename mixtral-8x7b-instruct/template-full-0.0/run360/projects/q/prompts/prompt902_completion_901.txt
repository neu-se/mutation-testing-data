 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs, function(err) { deferred.reject(err); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `fapply` function with an additional callback function, which is not present in the original code. This could cause unexpected behavior if the `fapply` function does not support this usage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `fail` function on the current promise, instead of chaining it to the `fapply` function. This could cause the rejection to be triggered immediately, instead of waiting for the `fapply` function to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(null, deferred.reject);
