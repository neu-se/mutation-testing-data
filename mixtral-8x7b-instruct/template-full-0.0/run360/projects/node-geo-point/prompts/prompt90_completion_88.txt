 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is now being called on the `Math` object, which may have a different implementation or behavior than the original `sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign changes the output of the `sin` function, potentially causing the subsequent calculations to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(Math.PI - θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `sin` function is being modified, which can change the output and affect the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
