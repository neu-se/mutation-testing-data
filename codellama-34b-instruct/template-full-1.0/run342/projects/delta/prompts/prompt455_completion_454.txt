  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` returns an array of removed elements, whereas `slice` returns an array of elements from the specified start index to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns an array of elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, whereas `splice` returns an array of elements from the start index to the end index - 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns an array of elements from the specified start index to
