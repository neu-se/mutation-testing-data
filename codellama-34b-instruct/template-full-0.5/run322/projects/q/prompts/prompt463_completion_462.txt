  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer check if the promise has been reported as unhandled, and would instead check if the promise is in the list of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the first promise in the list of reported unhandled rejections has been handled, instead of checking all promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the list of reported unhandled rejections is non-zero, instead of checking if the promise has been reported as unhandled.

DONE.
