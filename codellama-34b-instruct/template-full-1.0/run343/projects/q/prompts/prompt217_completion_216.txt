  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coerce` function would receive a `null` argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise, even if `value` was a thenable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coerce` function would receive an `undefined` argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise, even if `value` was a thenable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coerce` function would receive a rejected promise, even if `value` was a thenable, and would return a rejected promise.

DONE.
