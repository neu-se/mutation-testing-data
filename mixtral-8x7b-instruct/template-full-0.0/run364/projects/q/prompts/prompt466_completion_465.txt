 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit("rejectionHandled")` function would be called unconditionally, even if the rejection was not actually handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
atReport === unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit("rejectionHandled")` function would only be called if the rejection was the last one in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than if it was simply present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit("rejectionHandled")` function would be called even if the rejection was not present in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which could lead to incorrect reporting of handled rejections.

DONE.
