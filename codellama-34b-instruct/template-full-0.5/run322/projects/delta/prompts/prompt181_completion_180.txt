  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move ahead by `length` steps, which may not be the intended behavior in the context of the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the next `length` elements in the iteration, without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move backward by `length` steps, which may not be the intended behavior in the context of the code snippet.

DONE.
