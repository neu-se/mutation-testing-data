  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1, which would cause the resulting UTC offset string to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset used to generate the UTC offset string would be different from the original, which would cause the resulting UTC offset string to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be decreased by 1, which would cause the resulting UTC offset string to be different from the original.

DONE.
