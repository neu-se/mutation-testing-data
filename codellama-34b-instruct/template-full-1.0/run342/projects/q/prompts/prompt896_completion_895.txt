  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a local variable that refers to the Deferred object, while `defer` is a function that creates a new Deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a Deferred object, while `defer` is a function that creates a new Deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a Deferred object, while `defer` is a function that creates a new Deferred object.

DONE.
