 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would always receive `false` as the first argument, regardless of the value of `ended`. This could cause issues if the `read` function relies on the `ended` value to determine its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended, data, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive an additional argument, `data`, which it may not be expecting. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called immediately with the `ended` value, rather than being called as a callback when the `read` operation is complete. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly or throw an error.

DONE.
