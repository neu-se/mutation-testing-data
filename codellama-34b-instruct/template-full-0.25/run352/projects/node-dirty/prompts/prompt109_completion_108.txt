  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('Error message'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with the message "Error message", whereas the original code would emit an error event with a different message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', 'Error message');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with the message "Error message", whereas the original code would emit an error event with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Error message'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different message than the original code.

DONE.
