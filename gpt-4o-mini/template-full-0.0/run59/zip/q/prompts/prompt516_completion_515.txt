Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the handling of the promise from resolving to handling rejections only, which may lead to unhandled promise rejections not being caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because it executes a callback regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected, which alters the flow of handling the promise's outcome compared to the original `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` expects an array of promises and resolves when all of them are fulfilled, which is fundamentally different from the `then` method that handles a single promise's resolution or rejection.

DONE.
