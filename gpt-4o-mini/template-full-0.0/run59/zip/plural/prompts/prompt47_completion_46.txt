Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'es' instead of 's' to words ending in 'o', which is not the intended pluralization rule for such words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the word before appending 's', which could lead to incorrect plural forms for many words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly applies the pluralization rule for words ending in 'o' by appending 'ies', which is not a valid pluralization for such words.

DONE.
