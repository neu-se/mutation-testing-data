  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would be identical to the original, making it a valid mutation of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp['delete']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a different op in the iteration, which could have different attributes and different consequences in the composition process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iteration to the next op, which could have different attributes and different consequences in the composition process.

DONE.
