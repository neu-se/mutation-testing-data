  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, `!cb` would be falsy, and vice versa. This would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, which would call the `cb` function with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a `null` argument, which is different from the original code where it was called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a `true` argument, which is different from the original code where it was called with no arguments.

DONE.
