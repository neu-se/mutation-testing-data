 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * handler.invert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of the inverted handler, causing unexpected results in the invert and transform methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
handler.delete
