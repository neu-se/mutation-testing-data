  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['arg']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by the argument of the
