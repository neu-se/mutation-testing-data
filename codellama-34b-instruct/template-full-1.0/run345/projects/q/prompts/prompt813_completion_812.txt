  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(this).then(function (response) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `callback.fcall(this)` would effectively do nothing, as it is immediately followed by `then` which would ignore the return value of `fcall`. However, in this modified code, the return value of `fcall` is passed as an argument to `then`, which would cause `then` to wait for the promise to resolve before returning the value.

```
