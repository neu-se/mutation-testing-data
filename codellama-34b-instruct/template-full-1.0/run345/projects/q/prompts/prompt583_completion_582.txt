  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function is not defined in the current scope, and so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that takes a promise or a value and returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the `callback` function.

DONE.
