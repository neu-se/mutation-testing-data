  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"value"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tale"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a typoed property name, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the same value as the `head` property, which would cause an infinite loop.

DONE.
