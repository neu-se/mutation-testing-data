  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = flush;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event is not being triggered, which is necessary for the `MessageChannel` to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function() {
    flush();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event is not being triggered, which is necessary for the `MessageChannel` to function correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function() {
    setTimeout(flush, 0);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event is not being triggered, which is necessary for the `MessageChannel` to function correctly.

DONE.
