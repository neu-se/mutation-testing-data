  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not the same as the `b` variable, and the `a` variable is not defined in the scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is being added to 1, which would change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos()` function is being applied to the `b` variable, which would change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

DONE.
