Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.remoteAddress
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed two arguments to the `trust` function, but this replacement passes only one argument, potentially changing the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.localAddress, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the local address of the connection instead of the remote address, which could lead to different results when evaluating the trust proxy setting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.remoteAddress, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a different second argument to the `trust` function, which could affect the function's logic and lead to different outcomes when determining the trusted proxy.

DONE.
