Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to skip the next operation by advancing it by two instead of one, potentially causing the `line` to miss an operation and not process it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` effectively does nothing, meaning that the current operation is not consumed, which could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect processing of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a negative value to `next` is likely to cause an error or unexpected behavior, as it does not make sense to consume a negative number of operations, potentially leading to runtime exceptions.

DONE.
