  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if (messages)` check would evaluate to `false` even if `messages` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if (messages)` check would evaluate to `false` even if `messages` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is an array, and `messages.promiseDispatch` would be `undefined`, so the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on `resolvedPromise`.

DONE.
