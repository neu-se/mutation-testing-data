  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `=` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `cb` if `ended` is truthy, and `ended` would be assigned the value of `cb` if it is falsy. This would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, which would always call `cb` with the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `=` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `cb` if `ended` is falsy, and `ended` would be assigned the value of `cb` if it is truthy. This would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, which would always call `cb` with the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ? cb : null
```
