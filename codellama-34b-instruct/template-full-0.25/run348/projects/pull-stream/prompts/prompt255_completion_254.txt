  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that takes no arguments, but by adding `()` to the end of it, it would be called immediately, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that takes no arguments, but by adding `null` as an argument, it would be called with a null value, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that takes no arguments, but by adding `undefined` as an argument, it would be called with an undefined value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
