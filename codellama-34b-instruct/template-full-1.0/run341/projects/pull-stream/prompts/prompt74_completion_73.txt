  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the expression evaluates to `true` if `abort` is truthy and `true` is falsy, which means that the function `read` will be called with `true` as its first argument. In this new code, the expression evaluates to `true` if `abort` is falsy and `true` is truthy, which means that the function `read` will be called with `false` as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the expression evaluates to `true` if `abort` is truthy and `true` is falsy, which means that the function `read` will be called with `true` as its first argument. In this new code, the expression evaluates to `null`, which means that the function `read` will be called with `null` as its first argument.
