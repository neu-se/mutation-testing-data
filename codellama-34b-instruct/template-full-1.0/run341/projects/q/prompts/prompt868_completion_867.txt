  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise.

DONE.
