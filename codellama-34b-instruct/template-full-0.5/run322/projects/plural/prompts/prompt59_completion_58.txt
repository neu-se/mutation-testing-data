  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criterion'`, which is the singular form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'criteria'`, which is the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterionz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criterion'`, which is the singular form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'criterionz'`, which is a misspelling of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criterion'`, which is the singular form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'criterion' + 's'`, which is the plural form of the word with an extra 's' at the end.

DONE.
