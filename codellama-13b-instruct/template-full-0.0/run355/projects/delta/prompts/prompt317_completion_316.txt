  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.insert` property is not guaranteed to be a string, whereas the original code fragment assumes that it is a string. This could cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.attributes` property is not guaranteed to be an object, whereas the original code fragment assumes that it is an object. This could cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.retain` property is not guaranteed to be a number, whereas the original code fragment assumes that it is a number. This could cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
