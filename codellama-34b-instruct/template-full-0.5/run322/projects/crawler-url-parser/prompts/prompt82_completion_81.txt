  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the regular expression to remove any characters after a semicolon, which could result in different URLs being extracted from the HTML.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split("=")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the split function to extract the first part of the URL before the equal sign, which could result in different URLs being extracted from the HTML.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').substring(0, $(this).attr('href').indexOf("="))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the substring function to extract the first part of the URL before the equal sign, which could result in different URLs being extracted from the HTML.

DONE.
