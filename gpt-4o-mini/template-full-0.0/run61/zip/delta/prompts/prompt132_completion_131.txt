Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(end - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly retrieves one extra operation than intended, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect slicing of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `null` value to the `ops` array instead of the intended operation, which could lead to unexpected results when processing the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `attributes` of the `nextOp` instead of the `nextOp` itself, which would change the structure of the `ops` array and likely cause errors in subsequent operations that expect `Op` objects.

DONE.
