  
Option 1:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(...) 
```
It result in different behavior because `when` function is used to resolve or reject the promise object for `deferred.resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
Q.resolve(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise before the conditions for the promise object tests are met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
new Q()
```
It result in different behavior because it would create  a new promise object instead of using the existing one.

DONE.
