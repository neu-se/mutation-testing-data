  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is not a valid expression in this context, and would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.writeStream` is not a property of the `Dirty` class, and would result in a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is a stream object, and assigning `true` to it would cause it to be treated as a boolean expression, which would likely result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
