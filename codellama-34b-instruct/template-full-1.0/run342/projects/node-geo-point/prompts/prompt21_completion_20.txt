  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('longitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the properties are swapped, causing the condition to always be false when both properties are present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking for the presence of both properties, and if only one is present, it will return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra check for the presence of a third property 'extra' is added to the condition. If any of the three properties are missing, the condition will return false.

DONE.
