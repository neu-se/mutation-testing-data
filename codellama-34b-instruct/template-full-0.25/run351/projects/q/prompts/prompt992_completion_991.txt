  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the third.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the third argument instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a different variable than `arguments`.

DONE.
