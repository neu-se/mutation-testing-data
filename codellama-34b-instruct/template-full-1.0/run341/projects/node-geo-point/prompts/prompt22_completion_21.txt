  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 "longitude" in object
```
This would result in different behavior because we are checking if the key "longitude" exists in the object, whereas the original code is checking if the object has a property called "longitude".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, "longitude")
```
This would result in different behavior because we are checking if the object has an own property called "longitude", whereas the original code is checking if the object has a property called "longitude" regardless of whether it is an own property or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"longitude" in object && object.longitude !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because we are checking if the key "longitude" exists in the object and that the value of the property is not `undefined`, whereas the original code is only checking if the property exists.

DONE.
