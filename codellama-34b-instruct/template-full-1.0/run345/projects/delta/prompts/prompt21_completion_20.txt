  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a[key], b[key] - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is checking whether `a[key]` is equal to `b[key] - 1`, which is not equivalent to checking whether `a[key]` and `b[key]` are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is checking whether `a[key]` is not equal to `b[key] + 1`, which is not equivalent to checking whether `a[key]` and `b[key]` are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is checking whether `a[key]` is not equal to `b[key
