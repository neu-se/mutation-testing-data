 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty array would be passed as an argument to the `module.exports` function, which might expect an object or another data type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict'; function() { /* empty function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because a strict mode function with no name or parameters would be passed as an argument to the `module.exports` function, which might expect a different type of argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number would be passed as an argument to the `module.exports` function, which might expect a deterministic value or a specific data type.

DONE.
