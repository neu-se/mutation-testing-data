  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method with a regular expression, while the new code fragment uses the `split` method with a string argument. The regular expression version splits the string into an array of substrings, while the string version splits the string into an array of substrings separated by the specified string.

DONE.
