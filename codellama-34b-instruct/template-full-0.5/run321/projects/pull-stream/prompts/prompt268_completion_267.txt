  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `cb` function, which would have caused the stream to continue reading the next chunk. By replacing it with `null`, the stream will stop reading and return `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `cb` function, which would have caused the stream to continue reading the next chunk. By replacing it with `undefined`, the stream will stop reading and return `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `cb` function, which would have caused the stream to continue reading the next chunk. By replacing it with an error, the stream will stop reading and throw an error instead.

DONE.
