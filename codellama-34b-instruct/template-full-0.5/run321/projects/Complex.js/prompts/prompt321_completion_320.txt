  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.tan` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.acos` have different outputs for the same input.

DONE.
