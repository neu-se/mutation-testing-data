  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would take one more argument than it should, creating an incorrect slice of the `arguments` object. This change would cause the `nbind()` method to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would take zero arguments instead of two, creating a slice of the `arguments` object that is empty. This change would cause the `nbind()` method to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would receive `null` instead of an array-like object, causing it to throw an error. This change would cause the `nbind()` method to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
