  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, instead of a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, instead of a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to the value of the `property` property of the `object` object, instead of a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` property.

DONE.
