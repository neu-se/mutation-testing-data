  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is now `null`, which would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is now `undefined`, which would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is now a rejected promise with the reason `"error"`, which would cause the `deferred.resolve` method to be called with a rejected promise, rather than a fulfilled one.

DONE.
