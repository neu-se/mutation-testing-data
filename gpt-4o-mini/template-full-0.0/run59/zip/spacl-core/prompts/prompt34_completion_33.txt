Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it starts slicing from index 0 instead of 1, which includes the first element of the split array (the empty string before the first slash), potentially altering the expected structure of the path segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sorts the resulting array of path segments instead of reversing it, which changes the order of the segments and may lead to incorrect matching behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).map(part => part.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms each segment to uppercase, which could affect the matching process if the matcher is case-sensitive, leading to mismatches with the original path specification.

DONE.
