 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `if` block, even when `b` is not 0, causing incorrect results for non-real complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
oneMinus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, which is not handled in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the imaginary part of the result to 0, even when it should be non-zero. This would cause incorrect results for complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

DONE.
