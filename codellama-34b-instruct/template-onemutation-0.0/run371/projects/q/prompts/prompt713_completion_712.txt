  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the keys of the object, while the `values` method returns an array of the values of the object. Using `values` instead of `keys` would cause the `Q.keys` method to return an array of the values of the object, rather than the keys.
