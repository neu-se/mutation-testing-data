 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is passed as the second argument to `fapply`, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment uses `fail` method to handle rejections, while this change would cause the rejections to be passed directly to `fapply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(null, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` method is used instead of `fail`, and the rejection handler is passed as the second argument to `then`. This would cause the rejections to be handled differently than in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` method is used instead of `fail
