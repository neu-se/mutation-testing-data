  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `name` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `name` string, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `name` string into an array of individual characters, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different value.

DONE.
