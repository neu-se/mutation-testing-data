  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `null` or `undefined`, while this new code fragment only checks for `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `null` or `undefined`, while this new code fragment only checks for `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a value, while this new code fragment checks for the absence of a value.

DONE.
