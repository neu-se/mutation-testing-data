  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would not reset the unhandled rejections list, which would cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections != false
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would reset the unhandled rejections list, which would cause the tests to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would not reset the unhandled rejections list, which would cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
