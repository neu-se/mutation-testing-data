  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would resume the response stream with the value of the `PLACEHOLDER` variable. Replacing it with `res.resume(null);` would resume the response stream with a null value, which could cause the stream to be closed prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would resume the response stream with the value of the `PLACEHOLDER` variable. Replacing it with `res.resume(undefined);` would resume the response stream with an undefined value, which could cause the stream to be closed prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.res
