  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object in the original code is a promise, and the `value` property is not a valid property of a promise. This would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object in the original code is a promise, and the `fulfilled` property is not a valid property of a promise. This would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object in the original code is a promise, and the `rejected` property is not a valid property of a promise. This would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
