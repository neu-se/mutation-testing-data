  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!hasStacks` would negate the `hasStacks` variable, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined` even if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined` if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false`, regardless of the value of `hasStacks`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined` if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false`, regardless of the value of `hasStack
