  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `function (err, result) {}`. This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called with the promise resolution or rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `function (error, result) {}`. This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called with the promise resolution or rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `function (/*...args*/) {}`. This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called with the promise resolution or rejection.

DONE.
