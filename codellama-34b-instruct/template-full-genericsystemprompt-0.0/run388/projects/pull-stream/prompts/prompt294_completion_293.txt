  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the data, even if the stream has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the data, even if the stream has ended, and it would also return the `ended` value as the first argument to the callback, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the data, even if the stream has ended, and it would also return `null` as the first argument to the callback, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
