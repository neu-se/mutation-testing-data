  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the data, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negation of the data, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the data plus one, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

DONE.
