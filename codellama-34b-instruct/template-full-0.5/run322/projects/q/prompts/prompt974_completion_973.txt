  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `nmapply` is expecting an object as the first argument, but `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `nmapply` is expecting an object as the first argument, but `undefined` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `nmapply` is expecting an object as the first argument, but `{}` is an empty object, which may not have the same properties or methods as the original object.

DONE.
