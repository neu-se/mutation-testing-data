  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this code checks if it is not uncompressed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this code checks if it is high.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this code checks if it is medium.

DONE.
