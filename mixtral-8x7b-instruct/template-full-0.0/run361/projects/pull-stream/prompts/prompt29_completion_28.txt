 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] - 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the second argument to a number by performing arithmetic, which may not be the intended behavior and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the loop variable `i` instead of a fixed index `1`, which may lead to accessing a different array element or even an out-of-bounds error if the length of `ref` is less than `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref['1']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a string literal instead of an integer index, which may not be supported by all JavaScript engines or may lead to unexpected results if the array contains non-integer keys.

DONE.
