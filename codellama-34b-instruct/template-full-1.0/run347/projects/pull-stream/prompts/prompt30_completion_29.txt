  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at index 3 instead of index 2, which could cause errors if the array has less than 4 elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the elements at index 1 and index 2, instead of just the element at index 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return ref[2]; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that, when called, returns the element at index 2, instead of just returning the element at index 2 directly.

DONE.
