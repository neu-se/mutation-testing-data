  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will reject the promise, whereas `deferred.notify` will notify the promise of progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(newValue)` will resolve the promise with the new value, whereas `deferred.notify` will only notify the promise of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` will not notify the promise of progress, whereas `deferred.notify` will.

DONE.
