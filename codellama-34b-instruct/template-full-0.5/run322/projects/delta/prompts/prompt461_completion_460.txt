  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the rest of the `ops` array with the `next` element, instead of just the rest of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the rest of the `ops` array with the `next` element in reverse order, instead of just the rest of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)).filter(op => op.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the rest of the `ops` array with the `next` element, but only include operations with a length greater than 0.
