  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\b(?:goose|hippo)\b/i
```
This would result in a different regular expression that would not match any of the words in the original `tools`, `clothes`, `games`, `illnesses`, or `misc` arrays. The new regular expression would only match the words "goose" and "hippo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\b(?:snake|magic)s\b/i
```
This would result in a different regular expression that would match the words "snake" and "magic", but not the words in the original `tools`, `clothes`, `games`, `illnesses`, or `misc` arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\b(ghost|christmas)\b/i
```
This would result in a different regular expression that would match the words "ghost" and "christmas", but
