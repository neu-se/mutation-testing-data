  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which will result in a different distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the sum of the latitudes of the two points instead of the difference, which will result in a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * point2Rad
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the product of the latitudes of the two points instead of the difference, which will result in a different distance calculation.

DONE.
