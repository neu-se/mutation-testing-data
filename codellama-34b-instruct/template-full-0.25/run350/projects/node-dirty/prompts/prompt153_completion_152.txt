  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is a method that unblocks the stream, allowing it to continue writing data, whereas `cork` is a method that blocks the stream, preventing it from writing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a method that closes the stream, preventing any further data from being written to it, whereas `cork` and `uncork` are methods that control the flow of data through the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy` is a method that closes the stream and releases any resources associated with it, whereas `cork` and `uncork` are methods that control the flow of data through the stream.

DONE.
