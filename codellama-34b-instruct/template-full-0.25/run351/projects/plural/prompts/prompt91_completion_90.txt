  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun. The test suite should catch this difference in behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chill'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a different singular noun. The test suite should catch this difference in behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillie'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a different singular noun. The test suite should catch this difference in behavior.

DONE.
