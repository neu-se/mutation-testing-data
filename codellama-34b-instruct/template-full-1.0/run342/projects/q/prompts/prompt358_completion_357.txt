  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` would be bound to the `progressed` method, which would cause the method to be invoked on the `promise` object instead of the `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeStackTraceLong.bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` would be bound to the `makeStackTraceLong` method, which would cause the method to be invoked on the `promise` object instead of the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` would be bound to the `rejected` method, which would cause the method to be invoked on the `promise` object instead of the `deferred` object.

DONE.
