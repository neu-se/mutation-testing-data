  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the offset from the start of the array, while this new code would calculate the offset from the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the offset from the start of the array, while this new code would calculate the offset from the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the offset from the start of the array, while this new code would calculate the offset from the current index multiplied by 2.

DONE.
