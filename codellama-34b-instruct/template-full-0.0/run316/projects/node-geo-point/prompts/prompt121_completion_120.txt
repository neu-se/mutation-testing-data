  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method is not being called, and the `this` keyword is not being used correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method is being called with the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method is being called with the arguments in the wrong order.

DONE.
