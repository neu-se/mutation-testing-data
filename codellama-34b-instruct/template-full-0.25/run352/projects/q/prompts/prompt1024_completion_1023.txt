  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function that takes two arguments, but `null` is not a function and will not be called with any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function that takes two arguments, but `undefined` is not a function and will not be called with any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function that takes two arguments, but `function() {}` is a different function that takes no arguments.

DONE.
