  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the predicate function with the next op's attributes instead of the current op's attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the predicate function with an empty attributes object instead of the current op's attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the predicate function with the peeked op's attributes instead of the current op's attributes.

DONE.
