  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) || urlMap.has(currentUrl.baseurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to consider the base URL of the current URL, which is not currently being considered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && !urlMap.has(currentUrl.baseurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the current URL if it is not the base URL of the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.has(currentUrl.baseurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the current URL if it is the base URL of the current URL.

DONE.
