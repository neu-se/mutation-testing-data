  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments in a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value has been added as the third argument, which could potentially cause issues if the function being called expects a specific type or value for that argument.

DONE.
