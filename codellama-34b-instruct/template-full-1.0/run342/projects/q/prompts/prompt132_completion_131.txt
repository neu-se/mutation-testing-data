  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.prototype.toString`, which is a method that is called on objects to get a string representation, while this replacement uses `Array.prototype.toString`, which is a method that is called on arrays to get a string representation. The resulting string would be different between the two functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function unknown() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.prototype.toString`, which is a built-in JavaScript function, while this replacement uses a new function called `unknown`. The resulting behavior would be undefined and would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
alert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.prototype.toString`, which is a method that is called on objects to get a string representation, while this replacement uses `alert`, which is a method that displays a message in a popup
