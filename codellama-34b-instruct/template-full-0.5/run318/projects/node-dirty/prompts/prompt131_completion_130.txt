  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size()` is a method that returns the number of elements in the queue, while `size` is a property that returns the capacity of the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the queue, while `size` is a property that returns the capacity of the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.capacity
```
This would result in different behavior because `capacity` is a property that returns the maximum number of elements that the queue can hold, while `size` is a property that returns the current number of elements in the queue.

DONE.
