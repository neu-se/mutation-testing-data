  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the execution of the `flush` function by 1000 milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `flush` function, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 0, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to the `flush` function, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
