  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object, but `null` is not an object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object, but `undefined` is not an object and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object with specific properties, but `{}` is an empty object and would not have those properties.

DONE.
