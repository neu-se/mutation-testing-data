  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a constant value, while `callback` is a function that needs to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a constant value, while `callback` is a function that needs to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `callback` is a function that needs to be called.

DONE.
