  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called to flush the queue, while the new code fragment `throw "error"` will throw an error instead of flushing the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called to flush the queue, while the new code fragment `return` will return from the current function instead of flushing the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called to flush the queue, while the new code fragment `undefined` will not have any effect on the queue.

DONE.
