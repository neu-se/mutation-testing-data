  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function is used to parse a URL string, but the `parsedUrl.resolve` method is used to resolve a relative URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.related
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function is used to parse a URL string, but the `URL.related` function is used to get the related URL for a given URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.address
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function is used to parse a URL string, but the `URL.address` function is used to get the address component of a URL.

DONE.
