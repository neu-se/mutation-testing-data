 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, rather than the end using `push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes elements from an array and, if required, inserts new elements in their place, rather than simply adding an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.length = delta.length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because directly modifying the `length` property of the `delta.ops` array would add a new undefined element at the end, instead of adding a new `Op` object.

DONE.
