  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, which means that the `for...of` loop would iterate over a different array than the one being modified by the `push()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.query(path, verb, ctx) === false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the provided predicate function. In this case, it would return an array of rules that have a `query()` method that returns `false` for the given `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule.query(path, verb, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on each element in the
