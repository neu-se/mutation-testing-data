  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` will return a different object than `URL.resolve()`, which could affect the subsequent logic that uses the returned object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedBaseUrlStr` is a URL string, not an object, and it could affect the logic that uses the returned object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl` is a URL object, not a URL string, and it could affect the logic that uses the returned object.

DONE.
