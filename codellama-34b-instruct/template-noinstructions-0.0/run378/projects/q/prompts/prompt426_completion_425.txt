  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return the original value, rather than the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return `null`, rather than the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return `undefined`, rather than the fulfilled value.

DONE.
