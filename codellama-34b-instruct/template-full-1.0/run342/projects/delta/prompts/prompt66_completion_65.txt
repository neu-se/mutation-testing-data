  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to always return the delta object, even if `length` is negative, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to only return the delta object if `length` is even, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to only return the delta object with a probability of `0.01`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
