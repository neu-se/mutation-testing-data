  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `callback` is `undefined`, while this code fragment checks whether it is not `undefined`. If `callback` is not `undefined`, the original code would return `undefined`, but this code would return `callback`. If `callback` is `undefined`, the original code would return `callback`, but this code would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `callback` is a function, while this code fragment checks whether it is not a function. If `callback` is not a function, the original code would return `undefined`, but this code would return an error. If `callback` is a function, the original code would return `callback`, but this code would return `undefined`.
