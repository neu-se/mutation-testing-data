  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns an array of matches, and `=== true` would only be true if the array has a length of 1. In the original code, the `match()` method is used to check if the path starts with a slash, and the result is negated with `=== null` to check if the path does not start with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns an array of matches, and `=== false` would only be true if the array has a length of 0. In the original code, the `match()` method is used to check if the path starts with a slash, and the result is negated with `=== null` to check if the path does not start with a slash.
