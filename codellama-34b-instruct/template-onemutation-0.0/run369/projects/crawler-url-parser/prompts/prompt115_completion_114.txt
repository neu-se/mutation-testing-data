  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` returns an iterator over the keys of the map, while `values` returns an iterator over the values of the map. In this case, the `extract` function is using the `values` iterator to iterate over the values of the map, so replacing it with `keys` would cause the function to iterate over the keys instead, which would likely result in unexpected behavior.
