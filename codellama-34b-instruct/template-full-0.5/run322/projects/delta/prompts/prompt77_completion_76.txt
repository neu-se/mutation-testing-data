  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert && typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `insert` property of `lastOp` is an object, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain && typeof lastOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `retain` property of `lastOp` is an object, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete && typeof lastOp.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `delete` property of `lastOp` is an object, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is an object.

DONE.
