  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) && false
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, even if the `rule.matches` method would have returned `true`. This can help identify cases where the `matches` method is not properly checking the path and context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) || true
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `true`, even if the `rule.matches` method would have returned `false`. This can help identify cases where the `matches` method is not properly checking the path and context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) && path.startsWith('/')
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to only return `true` if the path starts with a forward slash (`/`). This can help identify cases where the `matches` method is not properly checking the path and context.
