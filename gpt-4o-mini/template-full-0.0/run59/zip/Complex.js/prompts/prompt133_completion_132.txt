Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is infinite, which would change the logic of the subtraction operation and potentially allow for cases that should return NaN to return a valid complex number instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass if `this` is not infinite, allowing the operation to proceed even when it should return NaN for `Infinity - Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is infinite, which could lead to incorrect results in cases where both operands are infinite, as it would not trigger the NaN return condition.

DONE.
