 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be resolved, even if the input promise is rejected. This is different from the original code, which forwards the rejection to the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be rejected with the given reason, regardless of the input promise's state. This is different from the original code, which forwards the rejection to the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { setTimeout(function () { resolve(); }, 0); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be resolved asynchronously, even if the input promise is rejected. This is different from the original code, which forwards the rejection to the returned promise.

DONE.
