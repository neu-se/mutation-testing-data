  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a, b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is being called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a, b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is being called with a different argument, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is being called with the arguments in a different order, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
