Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly double the distance, leading to an inaccurate destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a constant value of 100 meters to the distance, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the distance, causing the calculated destination point to be closer than intended.

DONE.
