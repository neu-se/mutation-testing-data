  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would consume twice as many ops as it should, leading to incorrect or incomplete transformation of the other Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `previous` method would consume ops in the opposite order than they were produced, leading to incorrect or incomplete transformation of the other Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would not consume any ops, leading to an infinite loop where the same ops are repeatedly transformed.

DONE.
