  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cosh` are different functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `cosh` are different functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the average of `a` and `b`, while `cosh` calculates the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

DONE.
