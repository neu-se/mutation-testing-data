  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the value to be incremented by 1, which would change the data stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the value to be decremented by 1, which would also change the data stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the value to be multiplied by 2, which would also change the data stored in the database.

DONE.
