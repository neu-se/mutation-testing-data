 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dwarf' in ['dwarf', 'roof']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'dwarf' is a property of the array containing 'dwarf' and 'roof', which would always return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['dwarf', 'roof'].includes(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the word (w) is included in the array containing 'dwarf' and 'roof', which would have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.toLowerCase() === 'dwarf' || w.toLowerCase() === 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts both 'dwarf' and 'roof' to lowercase, making the comparison case-insensitive.

DONE.
