  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => { zipArchive.glob(globPart); });` block to be executed even if `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would always return `false`, causing the `src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => { zipArchive.glob(globPart); });` block to be executed even if `src` is not a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would always return `false`, causing the `src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => { zipArchive.glob(glob
