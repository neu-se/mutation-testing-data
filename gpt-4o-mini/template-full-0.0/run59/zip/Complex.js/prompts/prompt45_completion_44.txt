Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof Array` checks if `a` is an instance of an array, which would not correctly identify the type of `a` as a string, object, or number, leading to incorrect parsing logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof (a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof (a + 1)` coerces `a` into a number if possible, which may lead to unexpected results when `a` is a string or an object, thus affecting the parsing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(a)` returns a string representation of the object's type (e.g., "[object Object]"), which does not match the expected behavior of returning a simple type string like "string" or "number", leading to incorrect parsing decisions.

DONE.
