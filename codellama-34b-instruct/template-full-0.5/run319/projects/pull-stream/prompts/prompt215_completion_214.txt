  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` is a function that takes two arguments, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` only takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` is a function that takes two arguments, but the new code fragment `abortCb && abortCb(aborted)` only takes one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` is a function that takes two arguments, but the new code fragment `cb(aborted, data)` reverses the order of the arguments.

DONE.
