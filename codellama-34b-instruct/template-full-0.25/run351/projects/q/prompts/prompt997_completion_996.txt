  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound `this` value, but the original code does not use `this` in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function immediately with a `this` value of `null`, but the original code does not call the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function immediately with a `this` value of `null`, but the original code does not call the function immediately.

DONE.
