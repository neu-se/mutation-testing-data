  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
        self.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve)
    });
```
This would result in different behavior because the promiseDispatch method is never called, so the dispatch method never returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = [key];
return Q(object).dispatch("get", args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects an array of property values, but instead receives an array of key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).dispatch("get", key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects an array of property values, but instead receives a single key.

DONE.
