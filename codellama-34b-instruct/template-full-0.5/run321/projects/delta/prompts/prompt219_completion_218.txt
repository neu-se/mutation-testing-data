  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to always return an empty delta, even if the two deltas being compared are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to always return an empty delta, even if the two deltas being compared have different lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0] !== other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to always return an empty delta, even if the first operation in the two deltas being compared is not equal.

DONE.
