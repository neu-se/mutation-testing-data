  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(null), null, null, self
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(null)` would return `NaN`, while `this` would refer to the global object, leading to different function calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, this, index, self
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be used instead of `thisp`, leading to a different set of functions being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, null, self
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the `this` value, leading to a different set of functions being called.

DONE.
