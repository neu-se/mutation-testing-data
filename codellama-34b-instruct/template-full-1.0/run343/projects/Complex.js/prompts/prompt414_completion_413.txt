  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is being negated, which would cause the final result to be flipped in the complex plane.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.abs(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is being used instead of `Math.sqrt`, which would cause the final result to be different.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to `Math.sqrt` is being changed, which would cause the final result to be different.

DONE.
