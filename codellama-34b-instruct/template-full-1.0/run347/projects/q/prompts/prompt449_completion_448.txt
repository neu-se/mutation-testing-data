  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise, whereas this modified code fragment returns a promise that is immediately rejected with an Error. This means that any code that depends on the promise being fulfilled will break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise, whereas this modified code fragment returns a promise that is immediately fulfilled with the value `null`. This means that any code that depends on the promise being fulfilled with a specific value will break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return 0; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise, whereas this modified code fragment returns a promise that is immediately fulfilled with the value `0`. This means that any code that depends on the
