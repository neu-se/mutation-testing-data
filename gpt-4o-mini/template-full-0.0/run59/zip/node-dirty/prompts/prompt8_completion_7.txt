Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store `null` in the `_data` map instead of the actual value `val`, leading to a loss of the intended data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing value at the key with the current value stored in the map, effectively making the `set` operation a no-op if the key already exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value being stored by 1, which could lead to incorrect data being saved if the original value was not a number or if the intention was to store the original value as is.

DONE.
