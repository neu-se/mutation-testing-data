 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input is an array instead of an object, potentially causing incorrect behavior in the `fromGeoJSON` and `fromLatLngArray` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(input) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input is an object using the `Object.prototype.toString` method, which might not behave the same way as the original `isObject` function, potentially causing issues in the `fromGeoJSON` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
input => typeof input === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not check if the input is not null, which could cause issues in the `fromGeoJSON` method if a null value is passed as an argument.

DONE.
