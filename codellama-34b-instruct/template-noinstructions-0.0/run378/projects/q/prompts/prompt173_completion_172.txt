  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the line to the `desiredLines` array, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the line from the `desiredLines` array, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.shift(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the line from the `desiredLines` array, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
