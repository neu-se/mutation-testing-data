  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` method is being called with `0` as the first argument, which would likely cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` method is being called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would likely cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` method is being called with an empty object as the first argument, which would likely cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
