  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with any callback function, and therefore would not execute any code in the `then` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with an empty function, which would not execute any code in the `then` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
