  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string with a value one greater than the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string with a value twice the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string with a value one less than the input.

DONE.
