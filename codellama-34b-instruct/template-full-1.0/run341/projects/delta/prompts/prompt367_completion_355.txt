  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code originally had a bug where it was checking if the peek type was equal to 'insert' for the entire while loop, but if it ever encountered a 'delete' operation, it would break out of the loop, even if there were more 'insert' operations after the 'delete'. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `true`, the loop will continue even if it encounters a 'delete' operation, which could result in different behavior if there are any 'insert' operations after a 'delete' in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code originally had a check for `priority === true`, but by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `false`, the check will never pass, which could result in different behavior if there are any operations with the 'priority' attribute set to true in the `ops` array.
