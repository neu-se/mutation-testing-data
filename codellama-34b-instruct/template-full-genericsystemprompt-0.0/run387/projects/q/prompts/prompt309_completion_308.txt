  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would throw an error, whereas `reject` would reject the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise with a reason, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

DONE.
