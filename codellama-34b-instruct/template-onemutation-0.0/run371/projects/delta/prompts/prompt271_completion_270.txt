  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would consider a delete operation as a valid operation to be performed on the current line, while the modified code fragment would skip the delete operation and move on to the next line.
