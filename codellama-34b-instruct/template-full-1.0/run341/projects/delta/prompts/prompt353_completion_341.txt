  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.dup.chop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would duplicate the inverted delta before chopping it, which could result in the modification of the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(inverted.length())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire inverted delta, which could result in the modification of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire inverted delta, which could result in the modification of the original object.

DONE.
