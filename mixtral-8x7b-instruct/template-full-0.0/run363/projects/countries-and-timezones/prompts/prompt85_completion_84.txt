 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the `options` argument, whereas the original code might pass different objects with various properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses an empty object as the `options` argument if it's falsy, whereas the original code might pass `undefined` in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options && options.defaultValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the `defaultValue` property of the `options` object if it's truthy, whereas the original code might pass the entire `options` object.

DONE.
