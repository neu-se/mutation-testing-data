  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to replace the last part of the path, while the new code fragment uses a slash. This would cause the `linkurl_without_last_part` variable to have a different value, which would affect the outcome of the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to replace the last part of the path, while the new code fragment uses a slash. This would cause the `pageurl_without_last_part` variable to have a different value, which would affect the outcome of the `gettype` function.
