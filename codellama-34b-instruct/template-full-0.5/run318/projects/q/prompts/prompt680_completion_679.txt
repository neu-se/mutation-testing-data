  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now 2 instead of 1, which would cause the function to start slicing the `arguments` array from the third element instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now 0 instead of 1, which would cause the function to start slicing the `arguments` array from the first element instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now -1 instead of 1, which would cause the function to start slicing the `arguments` array from the
