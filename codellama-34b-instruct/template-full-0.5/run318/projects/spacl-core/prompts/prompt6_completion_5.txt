  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method, which returns an array of all matches, while the new code uses the `test` method, which returns a boolean indicating whether a match was found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//.exec(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method, which returns an array of all matches, while the new code uses the `exec` method, which returns an array of all matches, but also includes the index of the match in the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//.indexOf(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method, which returns an array of all matches, while the new code uses the `indexOf` method, which returns the index of the first match in the input string.

DONE.
