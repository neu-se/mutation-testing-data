  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value returned by `this.matches`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality between `this.matches` and `false`, which would always evaluate to `false` since `this.matches` is a function and `false` is a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would check for strict inequality between `this.matches` and `true`, which would always evaluate to `true` since `this.matches` is a function and `true` is a boolean value.

DONE.
