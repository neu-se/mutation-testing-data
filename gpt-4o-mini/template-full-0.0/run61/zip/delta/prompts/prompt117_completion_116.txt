Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `elem.insert` is exactly zero, which would not account for any truthy values, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations when `elem.insert` is a positive number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `elem.delete` instead of `elem.insert`, which would incorrectly subtract from the length based on the delete property instead of adding based on the insert property, leading to an inaccurate length calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert && elem.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `elem.insert` is truthy and then accesses its `length` property, which would cause an error if `elem.insert` is not a string or an array, thus breaking the length calculation logic.

DONE.
