  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.length` is a number while `base` is an object, and `Object.keys()` expects an object as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `base[0]` is the first element of the `base` object, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of all the property keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `base` object, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of all the property keys of the object in the order they are added.

DONE.
