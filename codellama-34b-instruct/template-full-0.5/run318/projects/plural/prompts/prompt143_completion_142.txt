  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function that returns the type of a value as a string, while `type.toLowerCase()` would return the lowercase version of the type string. This could cause the pluralization rules to not match the expected output for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof type
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of a value as a string, while `type` is a function that returns the type of a value as a string. This could cause the pluralization rules to not match the expected output for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `type.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the type string, which could cause the pluralization rules to not match the expected output for certain inputs.

DONE
