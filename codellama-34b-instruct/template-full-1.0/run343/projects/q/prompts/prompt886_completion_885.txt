  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `array_slice` function, rather than the full argument list as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first two arguments to the `array_slice` function, rather than the full argument list as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the last argument to the `array_slice` function, rather than the full argument list as in the original code.

Done.
