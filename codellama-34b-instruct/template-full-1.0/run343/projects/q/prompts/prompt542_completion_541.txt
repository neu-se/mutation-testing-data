  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was spreading the array elements as arguments, while this replacement would pass the length of the array as a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was spreading the array elements as arguments, while this replacement would pass a copy of the array as a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was spreading the array elements as arguments, while this replacement would pass a new array with each element incremented by 1.

DONE.
