  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `opData` by 1, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle that increment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.opData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a different property called `opData` on the object `this`, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original `opData` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle random numbers.

DONE.
