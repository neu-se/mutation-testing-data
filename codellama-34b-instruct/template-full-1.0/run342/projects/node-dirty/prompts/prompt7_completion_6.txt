  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(val, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, potentially causing the `get` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key + '_', val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the key is modified, potentially causing the `get` method to return undefined for the original key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is modified, potentially causing the `get` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
