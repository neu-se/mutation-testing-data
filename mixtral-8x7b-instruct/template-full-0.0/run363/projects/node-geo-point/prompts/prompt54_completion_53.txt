 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the correct way to calculate the cosine of a number in JavaScript, while `cos` is a reference error since it is not defined in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, even if the input is negative, due to the way JavaScript handles division with negative numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of a number, not the cosine, so it would produce incorrect results.

DONE.
