  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[0]` element would be used instead of `ref[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2]` element would be used instead of `ref[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` element would be incremented by 1 before being used.

DONE.
