  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the country ID would cause the function to return a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the country ID would cause the function to return a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the country ID would cause the function to return a different country object.

DONE.
