  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` variable to be initialized with a different value than the original code, which could affect the behavior of the `diff()` method.
