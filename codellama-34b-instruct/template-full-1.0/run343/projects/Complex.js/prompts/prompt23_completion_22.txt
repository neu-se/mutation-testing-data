  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `a` is less than `b`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ^ b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b` to `a`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
