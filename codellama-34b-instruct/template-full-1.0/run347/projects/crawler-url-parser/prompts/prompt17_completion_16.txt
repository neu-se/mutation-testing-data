  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*/$', ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is missing the necessary delimiter for a substitution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now using the global flag, causing it to replace all instances of the pattern instead of just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/#.*/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now using a different pattern, causing it to match a different portion of the string.

DONE.
