  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(uncurryThis)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the `uncurryThis` function, which would cause the `uncurryThis` function to be called with the `this` value set to the `uncurryThis` function itself, rather than the `this` value set to the `Array.prototype.slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the `null` value, which would cause the `uncurryThis` function to be called with the `this` value set to the `null` value, rather than the `this` value set to the `Array.prototype.slice` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different
