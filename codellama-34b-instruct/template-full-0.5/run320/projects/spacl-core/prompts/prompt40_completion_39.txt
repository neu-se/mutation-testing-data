  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was splitting the `spec` string by whitespace, while the new code fragment splits it by empty string, resulting in a different array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('+')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was splitting the `spec` string by whitespace, while the new code fragment splits it by the `+` character, resulting in a different array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('|')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was splitting the `spec` string by whitespace, while the new code fragment splits it by the `|` character, resulting in a different array of strings.

DONE.
