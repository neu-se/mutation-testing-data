  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes.size` would return the number of key-value pairs in the `attributes` map, whereas `attributes` would return the map itself. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the map is not empty, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes.keys().length` would return the number of keys in the `attributes` map, whereas `attributes` would return the map itself. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the map is not empty, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.values().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes.values().length` would return the number of values in the `attributes` map, whereas `attributes` would return the map itself. This could cause
