 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the 'http://' instead of replacing it, which might cause issues when the URL is missing the protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol to 'https://' instead of 'http://', which might cause issues if the actual protocol is 'http:'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, (str) => 'http://' + str
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function to replace the protocol, which might cause issues if the function behaves differently or if it's not supported in the environment.

DONE.
