  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the code to always return `true` instead of `false` when the `this` object is an instance of `Complex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the code to always return `true` instead of `false` when the `this` object is an instance of `Number`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the code to always return `true` instead of `false` when the `this` object is an instance of `Object`.

DONE.
