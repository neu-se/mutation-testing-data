 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'Object'.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to get the keys of the string 'Object' instead of using the global `Object` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object['keys']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the 'keys' property of the `Object` constructor as if it were a regular object, which would likely return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.prototype.keys
