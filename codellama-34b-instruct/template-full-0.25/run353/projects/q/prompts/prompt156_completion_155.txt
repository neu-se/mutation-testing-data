  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the concatenated stack trace into an array of strings, each representing a single line of the stack trace. This would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail to filter out the internal frames, as it expects a string input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the concatenated stack trace to lowercase, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail to filter out the internal frames, as it expects a case-sensitive match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.replace("From previous event:", "From previous event: ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra space after the "From previous event:" string, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail to filter out the
