  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the `source` property of the `promise` object, rather than the `promise` object itself. This could potentially cause the loop to never terminate, or to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
