  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `λ`, resulting in a constant bearing of 90 degrees. 
`const λ = deg2rad(Number(bearing));`
This would result in different behavior because the formula would always result in a bearing of 90 degrees, whereas the original formula would result in a calculated bearing based on the given bearing and coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `θ *= 2`, resulting in a doubled bearing.
`const θ = deg2rad(Number(bearing)) *= 2;`
This would result in different behavior because the formula would always result in a doubling of the bearing, whereas the original formula would result in a calculated bearing based on the given bearing and coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `θ = 0`, resulting in a constant bearing of 0 degrees.
`const θ = 0;`
This would result in different behavior because the formula would always result in a bearing of 0 degrees, whereas the original formula would result in a calculated bearing based
