Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `nodeArgs` from an array containing the actual arguments to an empty array, which means that the callback will be called without any arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `nodeArgs` with an array containing a single `null` value, which means that the callback will receive `null` as its only argument instead of the intended arguments, altering the expected outcome of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies `nodeArgs` to only include the first argument, effectively ignoring any additional arguments that were passed, which could lead to incomplete data being processed by the callback.

DONE.
