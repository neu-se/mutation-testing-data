  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) to negate its condition, while this version uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to include the value of `end` in the condition. This would cause the while loop to never terminate if `end` is truthy, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) to negate its condition, while this version uses the logical NOT operator again to negate the negation. This would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true`, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) to negate its condition, while this version uses the logical NOT operator to negate the
