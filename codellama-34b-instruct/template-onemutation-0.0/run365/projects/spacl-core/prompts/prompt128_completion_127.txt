  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is inclusive, meaning that it will return `true` if `index` is equal to `count`, whereas the `<` operator is exclusive, meaning that it will only return `true` if `index` is strictly less than `count`.
