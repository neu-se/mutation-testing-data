  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiverOptions` will be treated as `undefined` instead of an object, which may cause the archive to be created with the default options instead of the specified options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiverOptions` will be treated as an empty object instead of an object with a specific set of options, which may cause the archive to be created with different options than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ garbage: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiverOptions` will be treated as an object with a new property called `garbage` instead of an object with the expected properties, which may cause the archive to be created with unexpected properties or fail to create the archive altogether.

DONE.
