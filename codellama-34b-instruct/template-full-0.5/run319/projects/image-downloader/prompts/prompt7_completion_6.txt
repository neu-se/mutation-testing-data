  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `extractFilename`, so if it was originally `true`, it would become `false`, and vice versa. This could cause the code to behave differently, especially if the `extractFilename` variable is used in a conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `extractFilename` is not equal to `true`, it would evaluate to `false`. This could cause the code to behave differently, especially if the `extractFilename` variable is used in a conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `extractFilename` is equal to `true`, it would evaluate to `false`. This
