  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a !== undefined` expression would evaluate to `true` when `a` is `undefined`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && a !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a !== null && a !== undefined` expression would evaluate to `true` when `a` is `null`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a == undefined` expression would evaluate to `true` when `a` is `undefined`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
