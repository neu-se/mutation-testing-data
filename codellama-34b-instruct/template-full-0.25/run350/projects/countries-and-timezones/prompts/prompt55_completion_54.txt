  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the value of the `deprecated` property of the `options` object if it is `true`, and would return `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the value of the `deprecated` property of the `options` object if it is not `true`, and would return `false` otherwise.

DONE.
