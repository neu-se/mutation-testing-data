  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would go in the opposite direction, potentially skipping over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other iteration, potentially missing certain paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = match.length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the end of the `match` array instead of the beginning, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or access out-of-bounds array indices.

DONE.
