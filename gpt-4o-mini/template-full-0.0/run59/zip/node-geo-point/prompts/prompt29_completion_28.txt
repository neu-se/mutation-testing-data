Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of `point1` instead of `point2`, leading to an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the longitude of `point2` instead of its latitude, which would cause the distance calculation to be based on the wrong coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
90
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a constant value of 90 instead of the actual latitude of `point2`, which would yield an incorrect distance calculation regardless of the actual coordinates.

DONE.
