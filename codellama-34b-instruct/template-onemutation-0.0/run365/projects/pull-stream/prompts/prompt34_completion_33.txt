  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the first element of the array is accessed, but in the mutated code, the second element is accessed instead. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.
