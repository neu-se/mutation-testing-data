  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = a['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = b['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = c['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

DONE.
