  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
  nodeback(error, null);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only call the nodeback with the error, while this modified code would call it with the error and null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object).then(function (value) {
  nodeback(null, value);
}, function (error) {
  nodeback(error, null);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call the nodeback with the error and null, while this modified code would resolve the object and then call the nodeback with the resolved value or the error and null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nodeback) {
  this.then(function (value) {
    Q.nextTick(function () {
      nodeback(null, value);
    });
  }, function (error) {
