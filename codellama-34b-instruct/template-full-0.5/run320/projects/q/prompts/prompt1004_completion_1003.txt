  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `get`, which would cause the code to call the `get` method instead of `post`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments are swapped, which would cause the code to pass the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is reversed, which would cause the code to pass the arguments in the wrong order.

DONE.
