  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array containing the value `1`, instead of the expected keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array containing the string `"foo"`, instead of the expected keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[function() { return "bar"; }]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array containing a function that returns the string `"bar"`, instead of the expected keys of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
