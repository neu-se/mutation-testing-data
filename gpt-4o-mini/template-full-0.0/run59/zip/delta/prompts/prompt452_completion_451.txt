Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if the current index is greater than or equal to the length of the operations array, which would cause the `rest` method to return an empty array even when there are more operations available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the next operation is zero, which could lead to returning an empty array when there are still operations left to process, thus misrepresenting the state of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current index is less than the last index of the operations array, which would incorrectly indicate that there are no more operations to process when there is still one operation left at the end of the array.

DONE.
