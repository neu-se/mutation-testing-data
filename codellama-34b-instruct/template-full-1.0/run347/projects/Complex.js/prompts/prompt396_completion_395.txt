  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `cos(b)` function with the variable `c`, which may have a different value and produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `b` variable, which could cause the calculation of the `tanh` function to produce wrong results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the `b` variable by 1, which could cause the calculation of the `tanh` function to produce wrong results.

DONE.
