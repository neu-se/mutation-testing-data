  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/x$|ch$|s$/i` matches words that end with "x", "ch", or "s", but the replacement function `function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }` would return the original word with "es" added to the end, instead of the correct plural form.
