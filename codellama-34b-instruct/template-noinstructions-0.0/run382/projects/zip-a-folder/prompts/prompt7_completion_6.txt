  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.replace('zip', 'rar')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the first occurrence of the string "zip" with "rar", which would change the file extension of the target file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(0, targetFilePath.lastIndexOf('.'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return the substring of the target file path up to the last occurrence of the "." character, which would remove the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('.').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the target file path into an array of substrings using the "." character as the delimiter, and the `pop` method would remove the last element of the array, which would be the file extension.

DONE.
