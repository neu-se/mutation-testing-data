  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be replaced with the `get` method, which would return the value of the specified property rather than setting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be replaced with the `delete` method, which would delete the specified property rather than setting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be replaced with the `apply` method, which would apply the specified function to the specified object rather than setting a property.

DONE.
