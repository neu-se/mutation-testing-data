  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a local variable that refers to the arguments passed to the current function, whereas `obj.arguments` refers to the `arguments` property of the `obj` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a local variable that refers to the arguments passed to the current function, whereas `arguments.slice(0)` creates a new array with the same elements as the `arguments` array but with a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` creates a new array with the same elements as the `arguments` array but with the first element removed, whereas `arguments` refers to the entire array of arguments.

DONE.
