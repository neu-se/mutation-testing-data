  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a function that returns a promise, while `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a function that returns a promise, while `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` is a function that returns a promise, while `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

DONE.
