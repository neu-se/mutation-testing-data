  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches a colon followed by one or more characters, while the new code fragment checks if the part does not match a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.includes(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches a colon followed by one or more characters, while the new code fragment checks if the part includes a colon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.indexOf(':') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches a colon followed by one or more characters, while the new code fragment checks if the part includes a colon at any position.

DONE.
