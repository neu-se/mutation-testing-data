 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove leading and trailing whitespace from the text of the anchor element, whereas the original code fragment preserves them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('href').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove leading and trailing whitespace from the href attribute of the anchor element, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the href attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).prop('outerHTML')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the anchor tag and its attributes in the extracted text, whereas the original code fragment extracts only the text content of the anchor element.

DONE.
