  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code fragment uses the `===` operator, which only checks for null. This means that if `thisOp.retain` is undefined, the new code fragment will not execute the same logic as the original code fragment.
