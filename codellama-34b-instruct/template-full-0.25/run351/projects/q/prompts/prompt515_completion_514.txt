  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.promise.reject` method would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
