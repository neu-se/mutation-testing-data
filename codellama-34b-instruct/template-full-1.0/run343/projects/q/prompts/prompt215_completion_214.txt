  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value + 1` expression is different from the original `value` expression, and would cause the code to take a different path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value * 2` expression is different from the original `value` expression, and would cause the code to take a different path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value / 2` expression is different from the original `value` expression, and would cause the code to take a different path.

DONE.
