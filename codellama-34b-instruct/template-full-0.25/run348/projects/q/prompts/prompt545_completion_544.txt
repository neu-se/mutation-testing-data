  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes a single argument to the `verb` method, while this modified code passes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes a single argument to the `verb` method, while this modified code passes three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg, arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes a single argument to the `verb` method, while this modified code passes four arguments.

DONE.
