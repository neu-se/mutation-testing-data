  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called with `null` as the argument, which would cause it to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, rather than the value of the `object` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause it to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than the value of the `object` variable.
