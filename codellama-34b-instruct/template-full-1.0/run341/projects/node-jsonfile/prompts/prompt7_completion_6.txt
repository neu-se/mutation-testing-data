  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync()` is a synchronous function that reads the entire contents of a file into memory, whereas `fs.readFile()` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync().toString()` would convert the contents of the file to a string, whereas `fs.readFile()` returns a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync().toUpperCase()` would convert the contents of the file to uppercase, whereas `fs.readFile()` returns the contents of the file as is.

DONE.
