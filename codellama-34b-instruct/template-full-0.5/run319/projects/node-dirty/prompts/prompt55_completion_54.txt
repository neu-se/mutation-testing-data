  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'error'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the code to behave differently if there is a listener for the `'error'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'close'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the code to behave differently if there is a listener for the `'close'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'write_close'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the code to behave differently if there is a listener for the `'write_close'` event.

DONE.
