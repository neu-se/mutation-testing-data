  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `_load` method, which loads the data from the file, but the replaced code does not call the method, so the data will not be loaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { throw new Error('Error loading data'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code catches the error and emits an `error` event, but the replaced code does not catch the error, so the error will be thrown and the program will crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this._data = new Map(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code loads the data from the file and stores it in the `_data` property, but the replaced code creates a new empty `Map` and stores it in the `_data` property, so the data will not be loaded from the
