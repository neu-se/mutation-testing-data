 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('')` creates an array of characters in the stack trace string, instead of a substring of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it only returns the error message, not the full stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the string representation of the error object, which might not include the full stack trace.

DONE.
