  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the URL with "https" instead of "http", which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the server or the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the URL, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the server or the client.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://www.');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "www." subdomain to the URL, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the server or the client.

DONE.
