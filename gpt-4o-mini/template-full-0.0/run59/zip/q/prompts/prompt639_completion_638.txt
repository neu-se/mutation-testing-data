Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation "remove" is not a valid operation for promises, which would lead to an error or unexpected behavior instead of deleting the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key, true]
```
This would result in different behavior because adding an extra argument (`true`) changes the expected parameters for the "delete" operation, which may cause the operation to fail or behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of deleting the property, it attempts to set the property to `undefined`, which does not remove the property but rather assigns it a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
