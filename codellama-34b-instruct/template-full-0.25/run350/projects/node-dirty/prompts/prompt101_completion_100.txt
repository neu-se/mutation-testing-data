  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the value is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the value is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the value is falsy.

DONE.
