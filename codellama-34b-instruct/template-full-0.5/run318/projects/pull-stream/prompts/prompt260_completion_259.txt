  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(err, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the `cb` function with the `err` argument, which could cause the stream to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a `null` argument, which could cause the stream to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a `true` argument, which could cause the stream to hang or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
