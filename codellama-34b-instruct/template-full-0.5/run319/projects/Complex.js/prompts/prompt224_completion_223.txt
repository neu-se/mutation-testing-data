  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value when `a` is negative, leading to errors in the `exp` and `expm1` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function would return a different value when `a` is not equal to zero, leading to errors in the `arg` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value when `b` is positive, leading to errors in the `exp` and `expm1` functions.

DONE.
