 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('dummy data')
```
This would result in different behavior because it writes 'dummy data' to the file stream instead of corking it, potentially causing unexpected data to be written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the cork property to false, which would disable corking the stream and potentially cause data to be written to the file immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it destroys the write stream, which would close the stream and prevent any further data from being written to the file.

DONE.
