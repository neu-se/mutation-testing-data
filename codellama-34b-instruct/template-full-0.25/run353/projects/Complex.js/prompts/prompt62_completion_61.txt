  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a different property of the `a` object than `phi`, and the code that uses `phi` is not expecting to receive a value for `arg`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because `r` is a different property of the `a` object than `phi`, and the code that uses `phi` is not expecting to receive a value for `r`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` is a different property of the `a` object than `phi`, and the code that uses `phi` is not expecting to receive a value for `abs`.

DONE.
