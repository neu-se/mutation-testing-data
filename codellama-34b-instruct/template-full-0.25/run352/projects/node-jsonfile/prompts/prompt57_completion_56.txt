  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match carriage returns instead of line feeds, which could cause the string to be split at the wrong places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n{2,}/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match two or more line feeds instead of just one, which could cause the string to be split at the wrong places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r?\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match either a carriage return followed by a line feed or just a line feed, which could cause the string to be split at the wrong places.

DONE.
