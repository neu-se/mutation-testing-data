  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if `country` is truthy or falsy, while `country === null` checks if `country` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if `country` is truthy or falsy, while `country !== null` checks if `country` is strictly not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if `country` is truthy or falsy, while `country.length === 0` checks if the length of `country` is equal to 0.

DONE.
