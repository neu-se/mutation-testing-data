  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the `ops` array, whereas the original code pushes a new operation object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an undefined value onto the `ops` array, whereas the original code pushes a new operation object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ insert: null });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an operation object with an `insert` property set to null, whereas the original code pushes an operation object with an `insert` property set to a non-null value.

DONE.
