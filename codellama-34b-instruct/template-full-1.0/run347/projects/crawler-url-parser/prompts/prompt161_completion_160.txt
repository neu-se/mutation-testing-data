  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`linkurl_without_last_part = linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only removed the last part of the path if it was either "index" or "default", while this new code would remove any part of the path that ends with ".index" or ".default".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`linkurl_without_last_part = linkurl_path.split("/").slice(0, -1).join("/");`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code removed only the last part of the path, while this new code removes the last part of the path and any previous parts of the path that end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`linkurl_without_last_part = linkurl_path.split("/
