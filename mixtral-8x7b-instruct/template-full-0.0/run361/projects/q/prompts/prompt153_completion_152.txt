 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks.concat.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is used to merge two or more arrays, and it returns a new array. By calling `join` on the result, it tries to convert the array into a string, which will result in a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks.slice(1).join
