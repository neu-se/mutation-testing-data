  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"blah", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the property name from "get" to "blah". The method would then throw a "Property blah does not exist" error, whereas the original code would return a promise for the property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method from "get" to "set" and set the property value to undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method from "get" to "delete" and delete the property.

DONE.
