  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is not equal to `b` and would cause the fraction to be rewritten, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * b` is not equal to `b` and would cause the fraction to be rewritten, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b / 2` is not equal to `b` and would cause the fraction to be rewritten, leading to a different result.

DONE.
