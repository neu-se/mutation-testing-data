  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses a backslash, which would result in a different path being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single backslash to escape the forward slash, while the replaced code uses two backslashes, which would result in a different path being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses a backslash, which would result in a different path being generated.

DONE.
