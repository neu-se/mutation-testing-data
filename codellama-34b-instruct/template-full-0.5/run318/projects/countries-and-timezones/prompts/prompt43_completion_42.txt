  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones for each country, including deprecated ones, which is not the intended behavior of the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { allTimezones: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones for each country, including deprecated ones, which is not the intended behavior of the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { timezones: [] }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array for each country's timezones, which is not the intended behavior of the original function.

DONE.
