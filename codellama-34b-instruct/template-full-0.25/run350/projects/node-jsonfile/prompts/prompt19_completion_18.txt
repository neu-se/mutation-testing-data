  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, but `file.toString()` returns a string representation of the file object, which is not what the function expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, but `file.name` returns the name of the file, which is not what the function expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.read()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, but `file.read()` returns the contents of the file, which is not what the function expects.

DONE.
