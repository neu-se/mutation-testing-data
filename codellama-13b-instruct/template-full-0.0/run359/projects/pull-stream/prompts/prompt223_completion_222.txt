  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is being called on the `tester` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.filter(function (data) { return !test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is being called with a different function argument, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.filter(function (data) { return test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is being called with a function argument that is the opposite of the original function argument, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
