  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset - 1, length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method will return a different portion of the string than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would expect a function instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset === length
```
This would result in different behavior because the statement would be evaluated to true only when the offset is equal to the length, which may not be the case.

DONE.
