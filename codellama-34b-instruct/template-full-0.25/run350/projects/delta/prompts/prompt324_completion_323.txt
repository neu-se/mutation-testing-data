  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return one fewer character than it should, potentially resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return one more character than it should, potentially resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return twice as many characters as it should, potentially resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
