  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would return a different subset of the `arguments` array, which would cause the `dispatch()` method to be called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, arguments.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a different subset of the `arguments` array, which would cause the `dispatch()` method to be called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [].slice.call(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a different subset of the `arguments` array, which would cause the `dispatch()` method to be called with different arguments.

DONE.
