  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would call the `terminate` function with the callback `cb`, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would call the callback `cb` directly with the arguments `null` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would call the `terminate` function with the callback `cb`, while the new code fragment `cb(ended)` would call the callback `cb` directly with the argument `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would call the `terminate` function with the callback `cb`, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would call the callback `cb`
