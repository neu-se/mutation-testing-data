  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) + Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function would introduce a new term that was not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function would introduce a new term that was not present in the original code.

DONE.
