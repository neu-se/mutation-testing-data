  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root.

DONE.
