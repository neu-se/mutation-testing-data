 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a).length > 0 ? attributes : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the number of keys in `a` instead of the resulting `attributes` object. This might cause the function to return `undefined` even if there are non-null properties in the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes || undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `undefined` if `attributes` is falsy, even if it contains non-null properties. This is different from the original code, which only returns `undefined` if there are no non-null properties in the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign({}, attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `attributes` object instead of a deep clone. This might cause issues if the original object contains nested objects or arrays
