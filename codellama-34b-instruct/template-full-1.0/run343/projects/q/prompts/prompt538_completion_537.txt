  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.some
```
This would result in different behavior because "some" is a property of "this" that may return a different value than "all" in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.each
```
This would result in different behavior because "each" is a function of "this" that may iterate over the collection of elements in a different order than "all" in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because "filter" is a function of "this" that may filter the collection of elements in a different way than "all" in certain cases.

DONE.
