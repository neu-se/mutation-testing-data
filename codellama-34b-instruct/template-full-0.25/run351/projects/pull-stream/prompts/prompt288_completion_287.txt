  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` would pass the `end` and `data` values to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `end, null` would pass `end` and `null` to the `cb` function, which could cause the test to fail if the function being tested relies on the `data` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` would pass the `end` and `data` values to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `end, undefined` would pass `end` and `undefined` to the `cb` function, which could cause the test to fail if the function being tested relies on the `data` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
