  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is a different property than `options.dest`, and the code is checking the existence of `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest.path` is a different property than `options.dest`, and the code is checking the existence of `options.dest`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(options.dest)` is a different value than `options.dest`, and the code is checking the existence of `options.dest`.

DONE.
