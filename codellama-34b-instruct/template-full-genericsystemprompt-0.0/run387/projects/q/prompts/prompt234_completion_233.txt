  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `promise` property of the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not the same as the `resolvedPromise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `source` property of the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not the same as the `resolvedPromise` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `stack` property of the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not the same as the `resolvedPromise` object itself.

DONE.
