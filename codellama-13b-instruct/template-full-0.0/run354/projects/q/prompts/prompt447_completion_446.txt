  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the fulfillment value of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfillment value of the promise, while this code fragment returns the result of calling the `inspect()` method on the fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value.toString(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the fulfillment value of the promise, while this code fragment returns the result of calling the `toString()` method on the fulfillment value.

DONE.
