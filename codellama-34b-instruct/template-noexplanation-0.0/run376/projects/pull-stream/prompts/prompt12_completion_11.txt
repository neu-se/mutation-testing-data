  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This change will cause the loop to never execute, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

DONE.
