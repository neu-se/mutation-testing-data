Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `get` on a different key, rather than the key passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `get` on a null key, rather than a string key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `get` with the same key as the argument, rather than a different key.

DONE.
