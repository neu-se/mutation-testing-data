  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the imaginary part of the result, which is a different value than the real part.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result, which would change the value of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the result, which would change the value of the imaginary part.

DONE.
