  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would resolve the promise with a value, while `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would resolve the promise with a value, while `deferred.resolve(null)` would resolve the promise with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would resolve the promise with a value, while `deferred.resolve(undefined)` would resolve the promise with an undefined value.

DONE.
