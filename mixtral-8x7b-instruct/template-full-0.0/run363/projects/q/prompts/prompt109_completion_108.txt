 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = this.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the array in reverse order, which may not be the intended behavior in the code that uses this `array_indexOf` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i += 1; i in this; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the incremented index is a property of the array, which may not always be the case for sparse arrays. Additionally, it decrements the index after the check, which may lead to skipping elements or entering an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'i' < this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a string comparison instead of a numeric comparison, which will always be false since the length of an array is a number and never a string. This would cause the loop
