  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
  throw new Error('Simulated error')
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply called the `cb` function, while this replacement code fragment throws an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
  return 'Simulated data'
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `cb` function with the `err` parameter set to `true`, while this replacement code fragment returns a string instead of calling the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
  return null
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `cb` function with the `err` parameter set to `true`, while this replacement code fragment returns `null` instead of calling the `cb` function.

DONE.
