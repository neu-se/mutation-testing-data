  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number with the `places` variable, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the imaginary part of the complex number before multiplying it with the `places` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * (places - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number with `places - 1` instead of `places`.

DONE.
