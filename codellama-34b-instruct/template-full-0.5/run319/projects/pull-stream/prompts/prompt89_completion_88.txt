  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `=` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(test && false) = test`, which would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `=` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `test = (test || true)`, which would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the expression would always be false.

DONE.
