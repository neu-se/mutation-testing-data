  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` would be called repeatedly, instead of just once, which could cause the stream to be read multiple times and potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could cause the stream to be read from a different position or with different options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err
