  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that is only defined within the `if` block, so it would not be accessible outside of that block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a string, so it would not be able to be parsed as JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a string, so it would not be able to be parsed as JSON.

DONE.
