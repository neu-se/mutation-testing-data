  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with the first word of the text content of the element, rather than the entire text content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return the text content of the element in uppercase, rather than the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove all alphabetic characters from the text content of the element, rather than returning the entire text content.

DONE.
