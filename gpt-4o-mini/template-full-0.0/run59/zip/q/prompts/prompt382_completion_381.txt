Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the callback would cause the `then` method to attempt to call `null.fcall(value)`, resulting in a TypeError, whereas the original code expects a valid function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the callback would lead to a similar TypeError when trying to call `undefined.fcall(value)`, while the original code expects a valid function to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "error"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would always return the string "error", which would change the resolved value of the promise to "error" instead of passing through the original value, unlike the original code which passes the value unchanged.

DONE.
