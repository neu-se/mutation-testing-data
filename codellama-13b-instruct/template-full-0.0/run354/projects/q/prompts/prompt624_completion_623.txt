  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.set(object, key, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.set` method is used to set the value of a property in a future turn, whereas the original code fragment `Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])` uses the `dispatch` method to set the value of a property in a future turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.get(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method is used to get the value of a property in a future turn, whereas the original code fragment `Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])` uses the `dispatch` method to get the value of a property in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.del(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is used to delete a property in a future turn, whereas
