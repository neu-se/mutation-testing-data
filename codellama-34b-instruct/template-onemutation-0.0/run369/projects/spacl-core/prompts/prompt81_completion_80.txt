  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code fragment converts the `path` variable to lowercase before using it. This could potentially cause the `matches` method to return a different result, depending on the specific values of the `path` and `ctx` variables.

DONE.
