 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result, as it calculates the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the trigonometric cosine function, which is not equivalent to the hyperbolic cosine function `cosh`.

DONE.
