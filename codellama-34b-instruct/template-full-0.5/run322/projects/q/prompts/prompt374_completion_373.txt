  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, and the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

DONE.
