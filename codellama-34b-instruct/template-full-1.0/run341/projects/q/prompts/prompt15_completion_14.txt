  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var hasStacks = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `hasStacks` to `true`, which would cause the subsequent code to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var hasStacks = !hasStacks;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of `hasStacks` between `true` and `false`, which would cause the subsequent code to execute differently depending on the initial value of `hasStacks`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var hasStacks = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `hasStacks` to `false`, which would cause the subsequent code to execute differently.

DONE.
