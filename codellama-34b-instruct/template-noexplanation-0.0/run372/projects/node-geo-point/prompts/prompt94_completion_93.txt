  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(sinφ2);
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it uses the `Math.acos()` function instead of `asin()`. This will cause the `calculateDestination()` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(sinφ2) + 1;
```
This code fragment is also a buggy version of the original code, as it adds 1 to the result of `Math.asin()`, which will cause the `calculateDestination()` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(sinφ2) * 2;
```
This code fragment is also a buggy version of the original code, as it multiplies the result of `Math.asin()` by 2, which will cause the `calculateDestination()` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
