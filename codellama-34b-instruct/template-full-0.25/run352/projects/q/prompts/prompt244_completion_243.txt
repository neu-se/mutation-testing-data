  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `promise` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `promise` object with the `this` context set to the `resolvedPromise` object, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `promise` object directly, which could potentially return a different result than calling the same method on the `resolvedPromise` object.

DONE.
