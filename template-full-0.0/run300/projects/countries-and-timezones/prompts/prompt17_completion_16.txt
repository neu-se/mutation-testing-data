  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is a different value than `id`, and it would change the behavior of the `if` statement that checks if `tz.r` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r + 1` is a different value than `id`, and it would change the behavior of the `if` statement that checks if `tz.r` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r * 2` is a different value than `id`, and it would change the behavior of the `if` statement that checks if `tz.r` is undefined.

DONE.
