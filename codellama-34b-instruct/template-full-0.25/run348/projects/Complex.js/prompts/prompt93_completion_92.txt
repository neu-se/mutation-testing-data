  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat spaces as NaN, which would cause the parser to exit in certain cases where it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the letter 'i' as NaN, which would cause the parser to exit in certain cases where it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the letter 'I' as NaN, which would cause the parser to exit in certain cases where it should not.

DONE.
