  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, creating the potential for an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not isInternalFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, causing the filterStackString function to return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the result of the original logic, potentially causing the filterStackString function to omit critical information.

DONE.
