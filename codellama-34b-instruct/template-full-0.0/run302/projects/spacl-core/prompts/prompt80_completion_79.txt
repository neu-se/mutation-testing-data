  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the rule matches the given path, while `matches` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the rule matches the given path and context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that takes two arguments, `path` and `ctx`, while `matches` is a method that takes only one argument, `path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that takes three arguments, `path`, `ctx`, and `deep`, while `matches` is a method that takes only two arguments, `path` and `ctx`.

DONE.
