  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while the new code fragment calls it with two arguments. This could potentially cause the test suite to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle errors, while the new code fragment does. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if an error is thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle objects, while the new code fragment does. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if an object is passed as an argument.

DONE.
