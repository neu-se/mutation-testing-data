  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop over the properties of the `verbs` object, rather than the elements of the `verbs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the elements of the `verbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.values(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the elements of the `verbs` array.

DONE.
