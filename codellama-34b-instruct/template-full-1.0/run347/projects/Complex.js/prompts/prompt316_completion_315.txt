  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin(a) * sin(a) * cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the sin(a) term, which is used to compute the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.5 * Math.sin(a) * cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the sin(a) term, which is used to compute the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.5 * Math.sin(a) * cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the sin(a) term, which is used to compute the imaginary part of the complex number. Additionally, the 0.5 factor would have a different effect on the imaginary part of the result.

DONE.
