  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator `===` which checks for both equality and type, while the replacement code uses the loose equality operator `!==` which only checks for equality and not type, so if `fn` returns a value with a different type than `false`, the behavior will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes both `key` and `val` as arguments to `fn`, while the replacement code only passes `val` as an argument to `fn`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the equivalence of `fn(key, val)` to `false`, while the replacement code checks for the equivalence of `fn(key, val)` to `
