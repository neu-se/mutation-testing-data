Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the absolute values of `a` and `b` instead of calculating the logarithm of the hypotenuse, which could lead to incorrect results in scenarios where `a` and `b` are both non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(_a * _b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the absolute values of `a` and `b` before taking the logarithm, which is not the intended calculation of `log(sqrt(a^2 + b^2))`, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(_a) + Math.log(_b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the logarithm of `a` and `b` separately and adds them together, which does not reflect the logarithmic relationship intended in the original function, potentially causing significant errors in calculations involving large values.

DONE.
