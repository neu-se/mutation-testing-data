  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus === minus
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to exit when the plus and minus signs are not balanced, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sub.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to exit when the string being parsed contains a subscript with a non-empty length, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to exit when the variable "a" is a number, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
