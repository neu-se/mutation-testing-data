  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified when the `makeNodeResolver()` method is called, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([])` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `nodeArgs` array and an empty array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified when the `makeNodeResolver()` method is called, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` creates a shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array starting from the second element, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified when the `make
