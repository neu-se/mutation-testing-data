  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace("https", "http")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `url` variable, which is a string, and the `replace` method to replace the "https" protocol with "http". However, this code fragment would replace the "https" protocol with "http" in the `url` variable, but it would not change the actual URL of the page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `url` variable, which is a string, and the `replace` method to replace the "www." subdomain with an empty string. However, this code fragment would replace the "www." subdomain with an empty string in the `url` variable, but it would not change the actual URL of the page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace("electron-window-manager", "electron-window
