  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is null. If `a` is null, the original code would return an empty object, while this replacement would return `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is undefined. If `a` is undefined, the original code would return an empty object, while this replacement would return `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is a string with the value 'object'. If `a` is a string with the value 'object', the original code would return an empty object, while this
