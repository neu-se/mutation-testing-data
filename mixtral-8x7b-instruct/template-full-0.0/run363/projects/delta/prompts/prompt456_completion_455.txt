 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would return an incorrect slice of the `ops` array, skipping one index each time it's called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would always return the same slice of the `ops` array starting from index 0, regardless of the current iterator position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest()` method would return the remaining elements in the `ops` array after the current index, instead of the elements from the current index to the end of the array.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process highlights potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the tests should fail due to the altered behavior of the `rest()` method. DONE.
