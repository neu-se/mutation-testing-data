  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !point.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the input object has the properties `latitude` and `longitude`, while this new code checks whether the input object has the property `type` and whether it is of type object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.type || !point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the input object has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, whereas this new code checks whether the input object has the property `type` and whether the `coordinates` property is an array with a length of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the input `point` is an object using the `isObject` function, whereas
