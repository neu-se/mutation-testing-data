  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff <= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for equality, but this change would also catch cases where the difference in part count is less than or equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for equality, but this change would catch cases where the difference in part count is not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for equality, but this change would catch cases where the difference in part count is greater than 1.

DONE.
