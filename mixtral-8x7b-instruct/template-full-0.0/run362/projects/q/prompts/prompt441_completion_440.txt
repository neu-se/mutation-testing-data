 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error as an error message instead of emitting an 'unhandledRejection' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not emit any event or perform any action, effectively removing the error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nextTick.runAfter(function () { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would defer the error throwing to the next tick, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
