  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment converts the `path` variable to lowercase before using it. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, depending on whether the `path` variable contains uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment extracts the last segment of the `path` variable using the `split` and `pop` methods. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, depending on whether the `path` variable contains multiple segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `
