  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of a string, and `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of a substring within a string. Replacing `indexOf` with `length` would cause the code to return the length of the string instead of the index of the substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt` returns the character at the specified index, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.substr(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` returns a substring of the original string, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the substring.

DONE.
