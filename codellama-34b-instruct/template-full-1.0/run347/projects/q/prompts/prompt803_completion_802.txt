  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `progressed` is undefined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this` is a Boolean negation of `this`, which is an object in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` throws an error, whereas the original code fragment does not have any errors.

DONE.
