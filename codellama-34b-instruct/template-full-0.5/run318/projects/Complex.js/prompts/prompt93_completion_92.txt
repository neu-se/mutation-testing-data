  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus + minus` expression would be equal to `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called more often.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 && !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isNaN(c)` expression would be evaluated to `false` when `c` is `NaN`, which would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called less often.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1 && isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus + minus` expression would be equal to `1` and `isNaN(c)` would be `true`, which would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called more often.

DONE.
