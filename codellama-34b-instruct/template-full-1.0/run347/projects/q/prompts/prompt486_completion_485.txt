resetUnhandledRejections()

This would result in the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
untreDUnhandledRejections()

This code fragment has the same name as resetUnhandledRejections, but has the wrong upper-/lowercase  split. Changing a single character in a function call will change the behavior of the program, because this function might be defined in the scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
1 + resetUnhandledRejections

This would result in different behavior because the expression would be  evaluated to a number, making the resetUnhandledRejections call ineffective.

DONE.
