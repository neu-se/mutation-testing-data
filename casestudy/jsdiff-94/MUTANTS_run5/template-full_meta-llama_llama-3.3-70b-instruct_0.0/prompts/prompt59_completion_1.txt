Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both old and new strings have a newline at the end, instead of checking for the absence of a newline in either string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!oldEOFNewline || !newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the old or new string is missing a newline at the end, instead of checking for the specific combination of conditions in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if there are no new lines before adds, without considering the presence or absence of newlines at the end of the old and new strings.

DONE.
