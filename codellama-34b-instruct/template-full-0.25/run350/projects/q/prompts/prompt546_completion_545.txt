  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of a generator expects a value as its argument, but `null` is not a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of a generator expects a value as its argument, but `undefined` is not a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of a generator expects a value as its argument, but `0` is not a value.

DONE.
