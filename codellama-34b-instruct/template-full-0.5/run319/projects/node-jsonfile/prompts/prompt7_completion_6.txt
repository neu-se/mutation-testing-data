  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that reads the entire contents of a file into memory, while `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)` is a bound function that returns a new function that takes no arguments and calls `fs.readFile` with the specified `file` and `options`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)` is a bound function that returns a new function that takes no arguments and calls `fs.readFile` with the specified `file
