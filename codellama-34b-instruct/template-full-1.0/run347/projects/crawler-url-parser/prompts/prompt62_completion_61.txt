  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.result
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is an object and `parsedUrl.result` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.split("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is a string and `split()` is a method that is not defined for strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.len()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is a string and does not have a method called `len`.

DONE.
