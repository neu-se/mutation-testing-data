  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `op`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `op` is `false`. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would result in the stream being drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the `op` variable, which is a boolean value. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `op` is `true`, and `false` if `op` is `false`. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument if `op` is `true`, and would not call the `read` function at all if `op` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
