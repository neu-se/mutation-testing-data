  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value assigned to `archiverOptions` would cause an error during the archiving process, as `archiverOptions` is expected to be an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value assigned to `archiverOptions` would cause an error during the archiving process, as `archiverOptions` is expected to be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { store: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `store` option is set to `false`, which would enable compression and change the resulting archived file's content.

DONE.
