  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of the `next` op and the remaining ops in the iterator, instead of just the `next` op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of the `next` op and the remaining ops in the iterator, instead of just the `next` op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1, this.index + 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of the `next` op and the next op in the iterator, instead of just the `next` op.

DONE.
