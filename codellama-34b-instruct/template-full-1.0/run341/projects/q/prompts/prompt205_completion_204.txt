  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var firstLine = lines[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the second line of the stack trace instead of the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var firstLine = lines[lines.length - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last line of the stack trace instead of the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var firstLine = lines[Math.floor(Math.random() * lines.length)];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract a random line from the stack trace instead of the first line.

DONE.
