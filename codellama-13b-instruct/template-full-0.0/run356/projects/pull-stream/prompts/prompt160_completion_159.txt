  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function would be called with `true` as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the `cb` function would be called with `undefined` as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_value` variable is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function would be called with `true` as its argument.

DONE.
