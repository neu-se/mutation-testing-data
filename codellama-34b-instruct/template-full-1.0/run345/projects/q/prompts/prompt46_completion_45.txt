  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(function () {
    throw e;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the throw statement would be handled differently in a NodeJS environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(function (e) {
    throw new Error(e);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the throw statement would be handled differently in a NodeJS environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(function (e) {
    throw new TypeError(e);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the throw statement would be handled differently in a NodeJS environment.

DONE.
