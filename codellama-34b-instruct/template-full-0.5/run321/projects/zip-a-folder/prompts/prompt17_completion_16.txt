  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `targetBasePath` variable is not used in the original code, and adding "foo" to it would change the resulting path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `targetBasePath` variable is not used in the original code, and subtracting 1 from it would change the resulting path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `targetBasePath` variable is not used in the original code, and taking a substring of it would change the resulting path.

DONE.
