  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(end.tail);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end.tail` property is not the same as the `end` object, and resolving with `end.tail` would result in a different value being returned from the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(end.head);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end.head` property is not the same as the `end` object, and resolving with `end.head` would result in a different value being returned from the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(end.tail.head);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end.tail.head` property is not the same as the `end` object, and resolving with `end.tail.head` would result in a different value being returned from the `get` method.

DONE.
