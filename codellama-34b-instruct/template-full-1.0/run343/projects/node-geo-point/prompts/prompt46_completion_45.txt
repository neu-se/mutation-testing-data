  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER>(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, but `deg2rad()` is a placeholder that is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1` and `point2` are different geographical points, and `deg2rad(point1.latitude)` would give a different result than `deg2rad(point2.latitude)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = Math.sin(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.sin()` is a function that calculates the sine of an angle in radians.

DONE.
