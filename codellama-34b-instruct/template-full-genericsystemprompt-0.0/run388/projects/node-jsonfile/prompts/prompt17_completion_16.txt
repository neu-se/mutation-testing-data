  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it's an object. This would cause the function to behave differently when `options` is a string, as it would not enter the `if` block and would not set the `encoding` property of the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is set to `'utf8'`. This would cause the function to behave differently when `options` is an object with a different encoding, as it would not enter the `if` block and would not set the `encoding` property of the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
