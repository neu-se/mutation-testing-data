 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b >= x || x >= b
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an off-by-one error in the comparison, which could lead to incorrect results or failures in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x) > Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to only consider the absolute values, which may not provide the same results as the original code fragment in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b && x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to only consider negative values, which is not the intended behavior and may lead to incorrect results or test failures.

DONE.
