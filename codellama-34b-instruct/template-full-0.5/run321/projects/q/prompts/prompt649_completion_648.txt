  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `put` is not defined in the `Promise.prototype`, whereas `post` is. This would cause an error and the test would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which would cause the method to be called with the wrong parameters. This would likely result in an error and the test would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are sliced, which would cause the method to be called with a different set of arguments. This would likely result in an error and the test would fail.

DONE.
