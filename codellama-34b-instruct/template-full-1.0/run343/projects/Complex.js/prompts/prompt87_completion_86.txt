  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isNaN` is a method that checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isNaN` is a function that checks if its argument is `NaN`. In the context of the code, `Array.isNaN` would always return `false`, as it expects an array as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a method that checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isNaN` is a function that checks if its argument is `NaN`. In the context of the code, `Number.isNaN` would always return `false`, as it expects a number as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a function that returns the arctangent of a number, while `is
