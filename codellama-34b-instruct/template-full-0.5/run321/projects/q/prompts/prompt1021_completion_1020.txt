  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to `dispatch` would be `1` instead of `nodeArgs`, which would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to `dispatch` would be `undefined` instead of `nodeArgs`, which would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to `dispatch` would be `null` instead of `nodeArgs`, which would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
