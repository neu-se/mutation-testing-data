  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Promise` object in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property is not defined on the `Promise` object in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property is not defined on the `Promise` object in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

DONE.
