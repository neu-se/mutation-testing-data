  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which would cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.concat([])]
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the `args` array with an empty array, which would cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })]
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the `args` array, which would cause the `post` method to receive a different set of arguments than the original code
