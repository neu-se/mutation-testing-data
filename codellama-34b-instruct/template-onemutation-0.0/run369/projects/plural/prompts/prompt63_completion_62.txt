  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word, while the new code fragment is 'bacteria', which is the plural form. The plural form of the word is used in the code, so the new code fragment would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
