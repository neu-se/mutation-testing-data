 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a TypeError to be thrown when trying to call the `null` value as a function in the `filter` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a TypeError to be thrown when trying to call the number `123` as a function in the `filter` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that always returns `true`, effectively making the filter function useless.

DONE.
