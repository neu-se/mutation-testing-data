  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that is bound to the `null` context, which would cause the `call` method to be called on `null` instead of the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is called on `null` instead of the original function, which would cause the `call` method to be called on `null` instead of the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called on `null` instead of the original function, which would cause the `call` method to be called on `null` instead of the original function.

DONE.
