  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `lastOp.attributes` is not null. If `lastOp` is an object with a null `attributes` property, the original code would still consider it as an object, while this replacement would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `lastOp` is an array. If `lastOp` is a non-object value that is not an array, the original code would still consider it as an object, while this replacement would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is not an object, while this replacement checks
