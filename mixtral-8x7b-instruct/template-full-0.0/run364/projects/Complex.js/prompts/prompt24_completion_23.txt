 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.41421356
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `Math.sqrt` function with the fixed value of the square root of 2, which would cause incorrect results for any inputs other than a = b.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(0.5 * Math.log(a * a + b * b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root using logarithms, but it does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is negative, which would result in a complex number as the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(a * a + b * b) ** 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses exponentiation instead of the `Math.sqrt` function, which may not be equivalent for negative inputs. Additionally, this method may suffer from floating-point
