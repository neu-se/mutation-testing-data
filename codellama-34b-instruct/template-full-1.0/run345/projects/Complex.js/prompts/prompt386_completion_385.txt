  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the imaginary part of the result to always be 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the real and imaginary parts of the result to be added together, rather than multiplied separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the real and imaginary parts of the result to be subtracted from each other, rather than multiplied separately.

DONE.
