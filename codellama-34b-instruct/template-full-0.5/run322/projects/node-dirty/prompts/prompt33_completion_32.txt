  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted, while `null` would indicate that the key should be set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted, while `''` would indicate that the key should be set to an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted, while `0` would indicate that the key should be set to `0`.

DONE.
