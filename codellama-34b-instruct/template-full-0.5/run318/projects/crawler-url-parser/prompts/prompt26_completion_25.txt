  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` anchor at the end of the pattern to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `^` anchor at the beginning of the pattern to match the start of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the matched substring with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a single space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the matched substring with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with the string "hello".

DONE.
