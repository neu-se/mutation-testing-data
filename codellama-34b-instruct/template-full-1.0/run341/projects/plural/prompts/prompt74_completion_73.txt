  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `addRule` expects a second argument that provides the exception for the rule, while the new code fragment `addRule('die', 'dice')` provides a new rule entirely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule("diesel", "diesel")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `addRule` expects a second argument that provides the exception for the rule, while the new code fragment `addRule("diesel", "diesel")` provides a new rule that is not an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule("diesel", "diesels")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `addRule` expects a second argument that provides the exception for the rule, while the new code fragment `addRule("diesel", "diesels")` provides
