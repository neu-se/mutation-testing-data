  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function that takes an argument and returns a value, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `mapper` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function that takes an argument and returns a value, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `mapper` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function that takes an argument and returns a value, while `0` is a primitive value that does not have a `mapper` function.

DONE.
