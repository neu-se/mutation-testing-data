  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to always reject, even if all the promises are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to always resolve, even if some of the promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to create a new deferred object, which would not be resolved or rejected in the same way as the original promises.

DONE.
