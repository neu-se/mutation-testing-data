Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode a URI, resulting in opposite operations being performed on the `normalizedUrl` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape.bind(null, normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unescape.bind(null, normalizedUrl)` would return a new function that, when called, would unescape `normalizedUrl`, whereas the original code directly called `unescape` on `normalizedUrl`, resulting in a difference in how the unescaping operation is performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(url) { return url; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement would be an identity function, leaving the `normalizedUrl` unchanged, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode the URI, resulting in a difference in how the URI is processed.

DONE.
