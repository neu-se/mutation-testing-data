  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always return `1`, while the modified code fragment `0` would always return `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always return `1`, while the modified code fragment `2` would always return `2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always return `1`, while the modified code fragment `null` would always return `null`.

DONE.
