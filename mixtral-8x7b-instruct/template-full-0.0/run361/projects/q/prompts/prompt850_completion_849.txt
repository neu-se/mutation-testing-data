 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `true`, and the error would not be checked before creating a new `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `true`, and the error would not be checked before creating a new `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and a new `Error` object would always be created, even if an error was not provided.

DONE.
