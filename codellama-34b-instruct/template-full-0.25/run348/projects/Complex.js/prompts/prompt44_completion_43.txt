  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not undefined, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not null. If `b` is null, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not undefined, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not NaN (Not a Number). If `b` is NaN, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not undefined, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not Infinity. If `b` is Infin
