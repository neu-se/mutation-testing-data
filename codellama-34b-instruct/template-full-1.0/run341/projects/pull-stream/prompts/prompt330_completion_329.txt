  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `data`, and it would trigger a different branch of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `data`, and it would trigger a different branch of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `data` variable, and it would not be equal to the original `data` variable.

DONE.
