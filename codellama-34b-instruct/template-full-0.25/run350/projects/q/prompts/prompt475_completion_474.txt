  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, regardless of whether the promise was actually reported as unhandled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport = at
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at the same index as the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, which may not be the same as the index of the promise in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport = array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at the same index as the promise in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which may not be the same as the index of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
