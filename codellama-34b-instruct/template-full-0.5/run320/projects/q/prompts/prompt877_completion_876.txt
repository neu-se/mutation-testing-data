  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its argument, but `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its argument, but `void 0` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its argument, but `[]` is an empty array, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
