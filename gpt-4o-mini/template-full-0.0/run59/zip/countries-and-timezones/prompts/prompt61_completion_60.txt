Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `buildCountry` would likely cause it to return an invalid country object or throw an error, whereas the original code passes the `data` object, which is expected to contain valid country information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `buildCountry` would not provide the necessary data for constructing a country object, potentially leading to a failure in the memoization process or returning an incomplete country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `data.countries[id]` directly would bypass the `buildCountry` function, which may contain logic for constructing a country object, leading to the return of a raw country object instead of a properly built one.

DONE.
