  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.then.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is only called when the promise is fulfilled, whereas `promiseDispatch` is called regardless of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.reject.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that is only called when the promise is rejected, whereas `promiseDispatch` is called regardless of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.notify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a method that is only called when the promise is notified of progress, whereas `promiseDispatch` is called regardless of the promise's state.

DONE.
