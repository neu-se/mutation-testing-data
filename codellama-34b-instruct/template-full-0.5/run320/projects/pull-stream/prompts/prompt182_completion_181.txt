  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` parameter is not used in the original code fragment, but it is used in the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` parameter is removed from the mutated code, which means that the `abortCb` function will not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` parameter is duplicated in the mutated code, which means that the `abortCb` function will be called with an extra argument that is not expected.

DONE.
