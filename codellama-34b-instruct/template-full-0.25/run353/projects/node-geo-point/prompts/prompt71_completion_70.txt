  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `θ` variable, which would cause the bearing calculation to be off by 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is subtracted from the `θ` variable, which would cause the bearing calculation to be off by 180 degrees in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the bearing calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

DONE.
