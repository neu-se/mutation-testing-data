Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.clear()` removes all entries from the map, while `urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr)` only removes the entry associated with `baseUrlStr`, potentially leaving other entries intact.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null)` adds a new entry with the key `baseUrlStr` and a value of `null`, instead of removing the existing entry, which could lead to incorrect handling of URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete('nonExistentKey');
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.delete('nonExistentKey')` attempts to delete a key that does not exist in the map, which has no effect, while `urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr)` specifically targets the entry associated with `baseUrlStr`.

DONE.
