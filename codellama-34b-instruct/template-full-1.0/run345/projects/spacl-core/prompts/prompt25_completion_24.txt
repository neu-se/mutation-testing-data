  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `min` is never greater than zero in the original code, so this replacement would cause the `if` condition to always evaluate to `false`, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!final && !opt && min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `final` is always `true` in the original code, and `opt` is always `false`, so this replacement would cause the `if` condition to always evaluate to `false`, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `max` is never less than zero in the original code, so this replacement would cause the `if` condition to always evaluate to `false`, resulting in different behavior.

DONE.
