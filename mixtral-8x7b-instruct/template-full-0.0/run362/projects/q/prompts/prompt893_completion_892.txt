 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `callback` function, potentially causing issues if the function relies on a specific value of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function(){}
