  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 1 from `opLength`, which is not necessary if the intention is to compare the length of the `other` delta to the length of the `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to `opLength`, which is not necessary if the intention is to compare the length of the `other` delta to the length of the `this` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(opLength, otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `Math.min` instead of `Math.max`, which would cause the resulting delta to have a different length in the case where `opLength` and `otherIter.peekLength()` have different values.

DONE
