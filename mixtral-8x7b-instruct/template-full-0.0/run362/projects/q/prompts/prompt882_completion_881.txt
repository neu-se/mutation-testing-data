 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is passed as the second argument to `fapply`, which is not the intended behavior. The second argument should be an optional transform function, not a rejection callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
