  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.toUpperCase()` would convert the data to uppercase, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.slice(1)` would remove the first character of the data, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.split('').reverse().join('')` would reverse the order of the characters in the data, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
