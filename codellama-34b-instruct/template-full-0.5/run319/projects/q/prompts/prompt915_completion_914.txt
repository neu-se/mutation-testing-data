  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(null)` would return `null`, which would cause an error when trying to call `makeNodeResolver` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(undefined)` would return `undefined`, which would cause an error when trying to call `makeNodeResolver` on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(true)` would return `true`, which would cause an error when trying to call `makeNodeResolver` on it.

DONE.
