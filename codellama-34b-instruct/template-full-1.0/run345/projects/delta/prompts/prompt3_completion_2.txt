  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` is a function that creates a deep copy of an object, whereas `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any defined value. Using `undefined` in the code would cause the `compose` function to return `undefined` for any input, which would result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` is a function that creates a deep copy of an object, whereas `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any defined value. Using `null` in the code would cause the `compose` function to return `null` for any input, which would result in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` is a function that creates a deep copy of an object, whereas `0` is a number that represents the absence of any
