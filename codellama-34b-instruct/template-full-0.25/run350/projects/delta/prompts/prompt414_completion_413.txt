  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be incremented by one more than the length of the current operation, which could cause the loop to skip over certain operations or repeat operations that have already been processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be incremented by twice the length of the current operation, which could cause the loop to skip over certain operations or repeat operations that have already been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be incremented by one less than the length of the current operation, which could cause the loop to skip over certain operations or repeat operations that have already been processed.

DONE.
