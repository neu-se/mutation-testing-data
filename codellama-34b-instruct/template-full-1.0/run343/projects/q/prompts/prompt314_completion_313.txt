  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise(resolve, reject) => {
  reject("ERROR");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` callback will be called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise(resolve, reject) => {
  resolve();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` callback will be called without any value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value instead of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `promise.race` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in an array resolves.

DONE.
