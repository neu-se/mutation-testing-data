  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with the negated `end` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
test.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method is being called on the `test` function, which could cause the function to return a string with the same characters as the original `test` function, but in a different case.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
void test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` operator is being used to discard the return value of the `test` function, which could cause the function to behave differently if it is expecting a specific return value.

DONE.
