  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `customWriteStream` property is flipped, meaning that if it is not undefined, the `targetFilePath` will not be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `customWriteStream` property is negated, meaning that if it is undefined, the `targetFilePath` will be used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because a comparison is made between the `customWriteStream` property and the `targetFilePath`, which may result in different behavior if the two are not equal.

DONE.
