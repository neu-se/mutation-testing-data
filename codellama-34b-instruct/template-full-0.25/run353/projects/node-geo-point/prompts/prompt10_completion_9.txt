  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called without the required `this` argument, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called with a different property name, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `coordinates` property exists on the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called with a different property name, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `type` property exists on the `point` object.

DONE.
