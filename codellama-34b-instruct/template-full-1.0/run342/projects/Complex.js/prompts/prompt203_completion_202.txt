  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, which would produce a different result than `Math.pow()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `(a + b) / 2` would produce a different result than `Math.pow()` for most inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` would produce a different result than `Math.pow()` for most inputs.

DONE.
