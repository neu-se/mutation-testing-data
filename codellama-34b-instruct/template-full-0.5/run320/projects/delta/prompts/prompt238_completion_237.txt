  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.min()` returns the smallest of the two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.min()` returns the smallest of the two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of the number, while `Math.min()` returns the smallest of the two numbers.

DONE.
