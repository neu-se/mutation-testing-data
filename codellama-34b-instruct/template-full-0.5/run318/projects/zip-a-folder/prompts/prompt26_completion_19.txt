  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore any `archiverOptions` passed in and always use an empty object, which could cause issues if the `archiverOptions` are important for the correct behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enable gzip compression, even if the `archiverOptions` passed in had `gzip: false`. This could cause issues if the function is not designed to handle gzip compression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the compression level to 9, even if the `archiverOptions` passed in had a different compression level. This could cause issues if the function is not designed to handle different compression levels.

DONE.
