  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basename` variable is not the same as the `decodedBasename` variable, which is the result of decoding the URL's basename using `decodeURIComponent`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename` function is not the same as the `basename` variable, which is the result of decoding the URL's basename using `decodeURIComponent`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(url.pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename` function is not the same as the `basename` variable, which is the result of decoding the URL's basename using `decodeURIComponent`.

DONE.
