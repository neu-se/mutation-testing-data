  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while the new code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` to remove only the last character. This would cause the plural form of words ending in "thesis" or "crisis" to be incorrect.

DONE.
