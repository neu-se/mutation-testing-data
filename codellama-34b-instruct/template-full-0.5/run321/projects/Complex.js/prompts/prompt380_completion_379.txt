  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable directly, while the modified code fragment divides `b` by 2, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable directly, while the modified code fragment adds 1 to `b`, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable directly, while the modified code fragment multiplies `b` by 2, which changes the result of the calculation.

DONE.
