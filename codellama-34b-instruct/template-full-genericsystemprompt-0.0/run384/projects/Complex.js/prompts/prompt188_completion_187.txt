  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, while this replacement uses the addition operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, while this replacement uses the multiplication operator twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, while this replacement uses the division operator.

DONE.
