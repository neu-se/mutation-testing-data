  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!task
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the truthiness of the `task` variable. If `task` is truthy, `!task` would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `task`, which could change the behavior of the program depending on the value of `task` and how it is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `task` by 2, which could change the behavior of the program depending on the value of `task` and how it is used.

DONE.
