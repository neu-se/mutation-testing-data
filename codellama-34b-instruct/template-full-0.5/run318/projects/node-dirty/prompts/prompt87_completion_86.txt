  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.shift` removes the first element of the array instead of the last element, which could cause the `forEach` loop to skip over the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first one, which would cause the `forEach` loop to skip over the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice(-1)` returns a new array containing only the last element of the original array, which would cause the `forEach` loop to only iterate over the last element.

DONE.
