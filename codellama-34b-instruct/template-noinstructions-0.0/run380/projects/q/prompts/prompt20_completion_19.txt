  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have thrown an error due to the missing `return` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have thrown an error due to the missing `return` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have thrown an error due to the missing `return` statement.

DONE.
