  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  embedType = 'image'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is used to determine the type of embed, and changing it to 'image' would cause the code to treat the embed as an image, rather than the intended type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  embedType = 'video'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is used to determine the type of embed, and changing it to 'video' would cause the code to treat the embed as a video, rather than the intended type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  embedType = 'link'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is used to determine the type of embed, and changing it to 'link' would cause the code to treat the embed as a link, rather than the intended type.

DONE.
