  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error object with a custom message, whereas the original code simply throws the reason as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason as is, whereas the original code throws it as an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    if (typeof reason === "string") {
        throw new Error(reason);
    } else {
        return reason;
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error object with a custom message for string reasons, but return the reason as is for other types.

DONE.
