  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ? null : cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null instead of the data, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended ? null : cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null instead of the data, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the data instead of the function, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
