  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice` alters the array in place, unlike `array_slice` which creates a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array of the function's own arguments, and slicing it at index 1 would exclude the first argument, potentially causing an error in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(baseArgs, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` and `args` are two separate arrays, and concatenating them would return a new array with unexpected contents.

DONE.
