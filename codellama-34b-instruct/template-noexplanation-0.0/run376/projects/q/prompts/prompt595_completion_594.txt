  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This will remove the first element of the `args` array, which is the `self` argument passed to the `promised` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(self)
```
This will concatenate the `self` argument to the end of the `args` array, which will result in the `self` argument being passed as the last argument to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -1)
```
This will remove the last element of the `args` array, which is the `self` argument passed to the `promised` function.

DONE.
