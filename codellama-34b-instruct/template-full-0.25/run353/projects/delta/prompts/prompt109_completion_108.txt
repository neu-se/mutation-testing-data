  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function is checking whether the `op` object is truthy, while the new predicate function is checking whether the `op` object is falsy. This could cause the `filter` method to return a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function is checking whether the `op` object has a `retain` property, while the new predicate function is checking whether the `op` object has a `delete` property. This could cause the `filter` method to return a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function is checking whether the `op` object has a `retain` property, while the new predicate function is checking
