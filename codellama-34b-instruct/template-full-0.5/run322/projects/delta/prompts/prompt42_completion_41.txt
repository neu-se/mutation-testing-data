  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0xffff)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(0xffff)` returns the Unicode character with code point U+FFFF, while `String.fromCharCode(0)` returns the Unicode character with code point U+0000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0xff)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(0xff)` returns the Unicode character with code point U+00FF, while `String.fromCharCode(0)` returns the Unicode character with code point U+0000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x1234)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(0x1234)` returns the Unicode character with code point U+1234, while `String.fromChar
