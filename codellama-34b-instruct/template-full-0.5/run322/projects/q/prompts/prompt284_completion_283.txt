  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of resolved.

DONE.
