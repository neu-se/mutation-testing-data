  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(args)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` twice, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.reverse()` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` in reverse order, whereas `args` would return the original array.

DONE.
