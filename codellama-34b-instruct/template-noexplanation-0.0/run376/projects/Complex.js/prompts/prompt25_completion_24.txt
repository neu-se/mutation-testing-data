  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a minus sign instead of a plus sign. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value, depending on the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the order of operations reversed. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value, depending on the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a plus sign instead of a minus sign. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value, depending on the input values.

DONE.
