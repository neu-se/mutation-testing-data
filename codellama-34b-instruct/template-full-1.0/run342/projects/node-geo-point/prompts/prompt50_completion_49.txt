  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)` is always positive, while `deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude)` can be negative, which would cause the calculation of `y` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1)` is always between -1 and 1, while `deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude)` can be any value between -180 and 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radians(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `radians(φ1)` is always between 0 and 2π, while `deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude)` can be any value between -180 and 180 degrees.
