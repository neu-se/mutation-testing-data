  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which could cause the calculation to produce an incorrect distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude, which could cause the calculation to produce an incorrect distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitudes of the two points instead of the cosine of the difference between their latitudes, which could cause the calculation to produce an incorrect distance.

DONE.
