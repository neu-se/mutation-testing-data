  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the context of the `logHypot` function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not modified in the original code, and the `+ 1` would cause the `logHypot` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` and `b` variables are not used in the original code, and the `+` operator would cause the `logHypot` function to return a different value.

DONE.
