  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it multiplies the sine of `b` by the hyperbolic sine of `a`, which is not the correct formula for the complex sinh function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This code fragment is another buggy version of the original code, as it multiplies the cosine of `b` by the hyperbolic cosine of `a`, which is not the correct formula for the complex sinh function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This code fragment is yet another buggy version of the original code, as it multiplies the cosine of `b` by the hyperbolic sine of `a`, which is not the correct formula for the complex sinh function.
