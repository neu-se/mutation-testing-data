 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'__nonexistentkey__'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove a nonexistent key, which would not affect the original key-value pair in the `_data` Map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'key', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to `null` instead of removing the key-value pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'key', '__nonexistentval__'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to a nonexistent value, which could cause issues if the value is expected to be a specific type or format.

DONE.
