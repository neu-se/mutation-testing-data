  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb`, while the replacement code fragment uses the `const` keyword to declare a function `cb` that does not take any arguments and does not return any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb`, while the replacement code fragment uses the `const` keyword to declare a function `cb` that takes an `err` argument and throws an error if `err` is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  return data;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
