  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setx"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setx" is an undefined method in `Promise.prototype`, causing the invoked dispatch function to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a resolved promise with the expected return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a numeric literal instead of a string matching the name of a known property or method in `Promise.prototype`, causing the invoked dispatch function to return a rejected promise with a `UsageError` instead of a resolved promise with the expected return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hasOwnProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because "hasOwnProperty" is a known property name in `Promise.prototype`, but it does not match any of the expected names for the "set" operation, causing the invoked dispatch function to return a rejected promise with an `InvalidOperation` error
