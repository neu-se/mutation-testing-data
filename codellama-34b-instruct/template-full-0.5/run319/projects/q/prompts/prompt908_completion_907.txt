  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number, not an array, and `array_slice` expects an array as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and `array_slice` expects an array as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, not an array, and `array_slice` expects an array as its first argument.

DONE.
