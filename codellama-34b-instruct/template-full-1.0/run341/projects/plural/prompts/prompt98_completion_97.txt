  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replac
```
This would result in different behavior because `replac` is not a valid method of the `String` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace("e", "a")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the original code fragment `/a/` was replaced with the string `"a"`, which would not capture the desired pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, "ae")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the original code fragment `/a/` was replaced with a different regular expression `/ae/`, which would not capture the desired pattern.

DONE.
