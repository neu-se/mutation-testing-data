  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `peekLength()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are not required to access the `peekLength` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` property is being used to determine the length of the next operation, and adding 1 to that length would cause the operation to be skipped.

DONE.
