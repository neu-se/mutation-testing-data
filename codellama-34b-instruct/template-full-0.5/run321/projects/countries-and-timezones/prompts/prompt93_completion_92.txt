  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, even if the `options` parameter is not provided, whereas the original code would throw a `TypeError` if `options` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `deprecated` property is truthy, whereas the original code would check if the `deprecated` property is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated || false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the `deprecated` property is not provided, whereas the original code would throw a `TypeError` if `deprecated` is not a boolean.

DONE.
