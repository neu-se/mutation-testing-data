  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `_read`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `_read` is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the value of `_read`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `_read` is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator subtracts 1 from the value of `_read`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `_read` is not null or undefined.

DONE.
