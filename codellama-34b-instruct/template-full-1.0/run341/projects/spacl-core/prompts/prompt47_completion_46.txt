  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/g` flag is not included, which would cause the regular expression to only match the first path segment rather than the entire path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is greedy, while the `/+` operator in the original code fragment is non-greedy. This would cause the regular expression to match the first occurrence of the word "plus" followed by any number of non-slash characters, rather than the last occurrence of the word "plus" followed by any number of non-slash characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:([^/]+)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not anchored to the beginning of the string, so it would match any occurrence of the word "plus" followed by any number of non-slash characters, rather than only matching the word "plus" followed by
