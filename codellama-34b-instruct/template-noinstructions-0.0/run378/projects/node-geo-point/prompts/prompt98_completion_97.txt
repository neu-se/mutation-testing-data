  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a variable, and `x + 1` is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a variable, and `y` is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a variable, and `1` is a constant value.

DONE.
