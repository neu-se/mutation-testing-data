  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.state` is undefined, so the comparison would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.fulfilled` is undefined, so the comparison would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.rejected` is undefined, so the comparison would always be false.

DONE.
