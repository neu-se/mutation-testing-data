  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `Q` function expects a truthy value for its `Promise.prototype` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with a `null` prototype, and the `Q` function expects a `Promise` object as its `Promise.prototype` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved `Promise` object with a value of `undefined`, and the `Q` function expects a `thenable` object as its `Promise.prototype` argument.

DONE.
