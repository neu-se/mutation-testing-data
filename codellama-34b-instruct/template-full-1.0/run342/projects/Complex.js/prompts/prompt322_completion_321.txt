  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1.5 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder is now different from the original value, which was `2 * a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder is now different from the original value, which was `2 * a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder is now different from the original value, which was `2 * a`.

DONE.
