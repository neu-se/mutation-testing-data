  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because "#" is a valid character in a string, while "@" is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
","
```
This would result in different behavior because "," is a valid separator in a string, while "@" is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"|"
```
This would result in different behavior because "|" is a valid character in a string, while "@" is not.

DONE.
