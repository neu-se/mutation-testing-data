  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` passes the error object and the callback function as arguments to the `map` function, while the new code fragment `null, cb` passes `null` as the error object and the callback function as arguments, which could cause the `map` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` passes the error object and the callback function as arguments to the `map` function, while the new code fragment `err, null` passes the error object and `null` as the callback function, which could cause the `map` function to behave differently.
