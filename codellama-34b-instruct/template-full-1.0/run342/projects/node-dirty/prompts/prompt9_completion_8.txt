  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'val'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to the string 'val', regardless of the actual value passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the key to null, which would cause errors when trying to fetch or delete the data later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to one less than the actual value passed in.

DONE.
