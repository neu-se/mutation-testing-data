  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() { throw new Error("Timeout"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this new code fragment throws an error if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("Timeout")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with a new error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() { return Q.resolve(new Error("Timeout")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this new code fragment returns a resolved promise with a new error message.

DONE.
