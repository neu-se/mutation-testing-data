  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```pow(parseFloat, 2)```
This would result in different behavior because the `pow` function would square the result of `parseFloat`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = parseFloat;
x(tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `i` variable, which would cause the loop to skip over elements in the `tokens` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = parseFloat;
x(tokens[i + 1]) + x(tokens[i + 2]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the result of `parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])` and `parseFloat(tokens[i + 2])`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
