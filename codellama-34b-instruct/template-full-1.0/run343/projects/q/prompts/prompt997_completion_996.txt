  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver = function(){ return null; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function, which is used to create a node-style callback, to always return `null`, which would cause any code that tries to call the callback to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver = function(){ return deferred.resolve; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function, which is used to create a node-style callback, to always return the value of `deferred.resolve`, which is a function that resolves the promise, instead of returning the actual node-style callback as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver = function(){ return undefined; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function, which is used to create a node-style callback
