  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `[1, 2, 3]` is a fixed array of numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `"hello"` is a fixed string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value.

DONE.
