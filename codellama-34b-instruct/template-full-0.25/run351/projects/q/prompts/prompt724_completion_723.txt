  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of its callback, which is `null` in this case. This means that the promise returned by `all` will be fulfilled with an array of `null` values, rather than the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by its callback. This means that the promise returned by `all` will be rejected with an error, rather than fulfilled with an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error()); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with
