  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new `Delta` object with the same ops as the original, while `chop` removes the last op if it is a retain with a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length` returns the number of ops in the `Delta` object, while `chop` removes the last op if it is a retain with a length of 0.

DONE.
