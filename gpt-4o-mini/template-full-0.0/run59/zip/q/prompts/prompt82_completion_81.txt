Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to push `null` into the `laterQueue`, which may lead to errors when the queue is processed, as `null` is not a valid task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because pushing `undefined` into the `laterQueue` would also lead to potential errors when the queue is processed, as it would not be a valid task to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform an arithmetic operation on `task`, which is expected to be a function, leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior when the task is executed.

DONE.
