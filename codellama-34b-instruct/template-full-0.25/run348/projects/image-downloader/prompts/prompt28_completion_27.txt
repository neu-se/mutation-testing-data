  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the right side of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the left side. This means that the resulting URL may be different, and the request may not be made to the intended resource.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` returns a substring starting from the second character of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the left side. This means that the resulting URL may be different, and the request may not be made to the intended resource.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a substring starting from the second character of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the left side. This means that the resulting URL may be different,
