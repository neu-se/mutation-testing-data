  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses the modulo operator to wrap the angle around to a value between 0 and 360 degrees. This would result in a different bearing value, which could affect the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ - 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses the modulo operator to wrap the angle around to a value between 0 and 360 degrees in the opposite direction. This would result in a different bearing value, which could affect the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ +
