  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
