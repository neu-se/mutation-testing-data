  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of property names, while `object` is an object and would be passed as-is to the `values` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of property values, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of property name-value pairs, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of property names.

DONE.
