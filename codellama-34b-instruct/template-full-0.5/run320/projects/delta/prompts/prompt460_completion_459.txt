  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to start from the next index instead of the current index, potentially returning a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to start from the previous index instead of the current index, potentially returning a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to start from the current index multiplied by 2, potentially returning a different set of operations.

DONE.
