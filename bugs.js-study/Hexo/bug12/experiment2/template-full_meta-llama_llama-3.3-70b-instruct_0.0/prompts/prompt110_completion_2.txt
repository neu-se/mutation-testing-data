Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is not called, which could lead to issues if `data.slug` is not already a string, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior in the `slugize` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses string concatenation to convert `data.slug` to a string, which might not be equivalent to calling `toString()` explicitly, especially if `data.slug` is an object with a custom `toString` method or if it's a value that doesn't convert to a string as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String(data.slug)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `String()` function to convert `data.slug` to a string, which is a more explicit conversion method than relying on the implicit conversion of `toString()`, and could potentially handle certain edge cases differently.

DONE.
