  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved after a delay, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise.

DONE.
