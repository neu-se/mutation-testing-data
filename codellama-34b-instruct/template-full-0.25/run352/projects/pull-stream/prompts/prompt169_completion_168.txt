  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is not being called in the original code fragment, but it is being called in this new code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with no arguments in this new code fragment, but it is being called with the `abort` and `onAbort` arguments in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments in this new code fragment, but it is being called with no arguments in the original code fragment.

DONE.
