  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` is a reference to the function's arguments object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing `arguments` with `null` would mean that the function would not receive any arguments, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` is a reference to the function's arguments object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing `arguments` with `undefined` would mean that the function would receive an `undefined` value as its first argument, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` is a reference to the function
