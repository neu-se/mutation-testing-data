  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is an object, while `null` is a primitive value. The `Object.keys()` method would return an empty array for `null`, whereas it would return an array of keys for the object `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is an object, while `undefined` is a primitive value. The `Object.keys()` method would return an empty array for `undefined`, whereas it would return an array of keys for the object `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is an object, while `{}` is an empty object. The `Object.keys()` method would return an empty array for `{}`, whereas it would return an array of keys for the object `b`.

DONE.
