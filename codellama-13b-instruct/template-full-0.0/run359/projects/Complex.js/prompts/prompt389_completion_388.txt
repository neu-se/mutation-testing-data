  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is used instead of `cosh`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function is used instead of `cosh`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function is used instead of `cosh`, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
