  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a specified reason, whereas `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a specified reason, whereas `self.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.mockResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `mockResolve` is a mock function that can be used to simulate the behavior of `resolve`, but it is not actually the `resolve` function.

DONE.
