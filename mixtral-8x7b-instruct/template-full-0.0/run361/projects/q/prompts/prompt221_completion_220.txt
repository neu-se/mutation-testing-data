 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of using `object_create` function, which may have a different behavior for creating objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `null` to `deferred`, which would cause errors in the following lines where `deferred` is expected to have certain object properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns an empty function to `deferred`, which would cause errors in the following lines where `deferred` is expected to have certain object properties.

DONE.
