  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This change will cause the function to return the opposite of what it should, effectively negating the filter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter
```
This change will cause the function to return the same result as the original code, effectively making the test redundant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(filter)
```
This change will cause the function to return the opposite of the filter, effectively negating the filter twice and returning the original result.

DONE.
