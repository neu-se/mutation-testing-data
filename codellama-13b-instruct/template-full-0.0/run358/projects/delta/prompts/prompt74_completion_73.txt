  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object is not a function, but a string. The original code fragment `newOp()` would throw a TypeError, while the modified code fragment `newOp.insert()` would return the `insert` property as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `newOp` object is not a function, but a number. The original code fragment `newOp()` would throw a TypeError, while the modified code fragment `newOp.delete()` would return the `delete` property as a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object is not a function, but an object. The original code fragment `newOp()` would throw a TypeError, while the modified
