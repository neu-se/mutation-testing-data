  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns the sine of its argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument. The `sin` function is used in the calculation of the latitude and longitude of the destination point, while the `cos` function is used in the calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos(φ2)` function returns the cosine of the latitude of the destination point, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument. The `cos(φ2)` function is used in the calculation of the latitude and longitude of the destination point, while the `cos` function is used in the calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan(φ2)` function returns the
