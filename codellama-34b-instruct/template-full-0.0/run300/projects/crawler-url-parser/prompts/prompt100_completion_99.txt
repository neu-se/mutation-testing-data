  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol of the current URL instead of the URL itself, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the host of the current URL instead of the URL itself, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
