  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if an object is promise-like, meaning it has a `then` method, while `isPromise` checks if an object is a promise instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if an object is a fulfilled promise, while `!isFulfilled` checks if an object is not a fulfilled promise, which could include rejected or pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` checks if an object is a rejected promise, while `isPromise` checks if an object is a promise instance.

DONE.
