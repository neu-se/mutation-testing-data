  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` is a static method of the `Array` object, whereas `[].isArray` is an instance method of the `Array.prototype` object, which may not be supported in all JavaScript engines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3].isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` is a static method of the `Array` object, whereas `[1, 2, 3].isArray` is an instance method of the `Array.prototype` object, which may not be supported in all JavaScript engines. Additionally, this would return `true` for arrays with elements, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` is a static method of the `Array` object, whereas `a.is
