Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify arrays as objects, returning `true` for arrays, which may not be the intended behavior of the `isObject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` for `null`, which is technically an object in JavaScript, leading to incorrect results when checking if a value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for arrays and `null`, but would not correctly handle cases where the value is a non-object type, potentially leading to misleading results in the context of the function's purpose.

DONE.
