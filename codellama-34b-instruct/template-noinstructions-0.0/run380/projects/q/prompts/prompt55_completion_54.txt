  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is being called on the `process` object with a different argument, which would cause the comparison to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is being called on the `process` object with a different argument, which would cause the comparison to fail.
