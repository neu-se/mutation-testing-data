  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, "";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be a number, while this code fragment would result in an empty string being passed as the second argument to `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be a number, while this code fragment would result in `null` being passed as the second argument to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not expect `undefined` to be passed as the first argument to `cb`, while this code fragment would result in `undefined` being passed as the first argument to `cb`, followed by the original `data` value.

DONE.
