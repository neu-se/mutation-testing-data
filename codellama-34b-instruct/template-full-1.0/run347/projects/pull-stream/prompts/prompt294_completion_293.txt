  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback function with an error message if the `ended` variable is true, but this replacement code calls the callback function with both `null` arguments, which could be interpreted as a successful completion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, ended);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback function with an error message if the `ended` variable is true, but this replacement code calls the callback function with `true` as the first argument and `ended` as the second argument, which could be interpreted as a successful completion with a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err || true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback function with an error message if the `ended` variable is true, but this replacement code calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument and
