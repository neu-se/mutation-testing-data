  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not incremented, so the loop would never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is decremented, so the loop would never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is incremented by 2, so the loop would never terminate.

DONE.
