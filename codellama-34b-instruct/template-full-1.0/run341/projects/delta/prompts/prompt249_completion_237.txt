  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
IF otherIter.hasNext() THEN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `IF` statement is not needed as the `hasNext()` method is already called later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
IF NOT otherIter.hasNext() THEN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NOT` operator is not needed as the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
IF otherIter.peek() THEN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is not needed as the `hasNext()` method is already called later in the code.

DONE.
