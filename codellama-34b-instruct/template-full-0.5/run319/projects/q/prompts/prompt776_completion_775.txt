  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` would return a string representation of the promise's state, rather than the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` would return a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(promise)` would return a rejected promise with the reason being the original promise, rather than the promise itself.

DONE.
