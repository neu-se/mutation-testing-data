  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment would always prepend "https://" to the URL, even if the original URL already started with "http://" or "https://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment would always prepend "ftp://" to the URL, even if the original URL already started with "http://", "https://", or "ftp://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment would always prepend "http://www." to the URL, even if the original URL already started with "http://", "https://", "ftp://", or "www.".

DONE.
