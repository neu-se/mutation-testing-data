  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the peeked operation, which may not be the same as the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the peeked operation, which may not be the same as the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator to the next operation, which may not be the same as the current operation.

DONE.
