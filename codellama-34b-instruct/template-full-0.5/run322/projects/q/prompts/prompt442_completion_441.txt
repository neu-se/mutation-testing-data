  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the strings "unhandledRejection" and "Error", resulting in the string "unhandledRejectionError", which is not a recognized event type in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "unhandledRejection" with the number 1, resulting in the string "unhandledRejection1", which is not a recognized event type in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "rejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the strings "unhandledRejection" and "rejection", resulting in the string "unhandledRejectionrejection", which is not a recognized event type in the code.
