 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the newOp at the end of the array, instead of considering the index variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when using splice, as it expects a valid index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * this.ops.length
