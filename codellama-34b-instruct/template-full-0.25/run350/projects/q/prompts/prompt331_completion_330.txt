  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `resolve` function, causing it to always return `false` instead of resolving the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with `null` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with `undefined` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
