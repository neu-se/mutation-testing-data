  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the replacement code fragment `null` is a constant that is not a function and does not take any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the replacement code fragment `undefined` is a constant that is not a function and does not take any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the replacement code fragment `function () {}` is a function that takes no arguments and does not return anything.

DONE.
