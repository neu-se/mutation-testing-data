  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path segment and the trailing slash, while the new code fragment replaces the last path segment with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path segment and the trailing slash, while the new code fragment replaces the last path segment with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path segment and the trailing slash, while the new code fragment replaces the last path segment with a double backslash.

DONE.
