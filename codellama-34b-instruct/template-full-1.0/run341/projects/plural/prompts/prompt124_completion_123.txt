  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this code fragment appends an "s" to the word, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return type(w) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this code fragment returns the type of the word, which would result in incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this code fragment multiplies the word by 2, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

DONE.
