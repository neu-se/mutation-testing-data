  Sure, here are my answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the variable is falsy, while the new code checks if it's strictly equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"I'm a placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the variable is falsy, while the new code checks if it's a string with the value "I'm a placeholder".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the variable is falsy, while the new code checks if it's an empty array.

DONE.
