  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object for `ends` on each call to `put`, while this modified code fragment reuses the same deferred object. This could cause issues if the `put` method is called multiple times before the `get` method is called, as the `ends` deferred object would be resolved multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object for `ends` on each call to `put`, while this modified code fragment reuses the same deferred object. This could cause issues if the `put` method is called multiple times before the `get` method is called, as the `ends` deferred object would be resolved multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
