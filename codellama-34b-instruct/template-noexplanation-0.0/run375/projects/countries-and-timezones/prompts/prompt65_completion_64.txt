  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null;
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to always return `null`, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = undefined;
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to always return `undefined`, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = {};
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to always return an empty object, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
