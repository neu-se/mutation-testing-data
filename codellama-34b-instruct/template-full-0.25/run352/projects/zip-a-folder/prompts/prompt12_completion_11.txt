  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK` bitmask includes both read and write permissions, whereas the original code only included read permission. This could cause the code to fail if the file is not writable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK` bitmask includes only read and write permissions, whereas the original code included all permissions. This could cause the code to succeed even if the file is not writable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.
