  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to words ending in 'o', while this new code fragment adds 'is'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to words ending in 'o', while this new code fragment adds 's' and then 'es'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to words ending in 'o', while this new code fragment adds 's',
