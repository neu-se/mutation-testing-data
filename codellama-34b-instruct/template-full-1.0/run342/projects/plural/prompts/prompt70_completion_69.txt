  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(ce|lo)$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/lost/, 'lost') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern for the replacement is different, and the function uses a different logic to handle the replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(ce|lo)$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/lost\,/, 'lost') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern for the replacement is different, and the function uses a different logic to handle the replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(ce|lo)$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/lo/, 'lo'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern for the replacement is different, and the function uses a different logic to handle the replacement.

DONE.
