  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*args
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary `*` operator in front of `args` would unpack the arguments as a tuple, but the `args` variable is already a tuple.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is a tuple, but `args[0]` would access only the first element of the tuple.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0:1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice operation `args[0:1]` would access only the first element of the tuple, but the `:` syntax indicates that the slice should include the element at index 1.

DONE.
