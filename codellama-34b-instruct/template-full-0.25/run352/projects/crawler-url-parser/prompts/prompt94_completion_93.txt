  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "extra" to the end of the href attribute, which would cause the URL to be different from the original and potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + '?extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "?extra" to the end of the href attribute, which would cause the URL to be different from the original and potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + '#extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "#extra" to the end of the href attribute, which would cause the URL to be different from the original and potentially cause the test to fail.

DONE.
