  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that listens to the `'load'` event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that listens to the `'load'` event would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that listens to the `'load'` event would not be triggered.

DONE.
