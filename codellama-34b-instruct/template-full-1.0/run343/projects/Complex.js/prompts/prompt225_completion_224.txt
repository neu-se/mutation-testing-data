  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator performs type coercion before comparison, while the `===` operator does not. Therefore, if `b` is a non-zero number with a decimal part that is truncated, the `==` operator would still evaluate as true, while the `===` operator would evaluate as false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b - 0) == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operation forces `b` to be converted to a number, which would remove any trailing zeroes and cause the comparison to treat `b` as zero if it was originally represented as a zero with trailing digits.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(b) == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseFloat()` function would convert `b` to a floating-point number, which would remove any trailing zeroes and cause the comparison
