  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a different function than `_fulfilled`, and it would be called instead of `_fulfilled` when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a different function than `_fulfilled`, and it would be called instead of `_fulfilled` when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value passed to it, whereas `_fulfilled` returns the result of calling the callback function with the value.

DONE.
