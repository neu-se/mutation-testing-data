  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.message` is a string, while `err` is an object. In the original code, `err` is passed as an argument to the `Error` constructor, which expects an object. If `err.message` is passed instead, it will result in a different error message being displayed.
