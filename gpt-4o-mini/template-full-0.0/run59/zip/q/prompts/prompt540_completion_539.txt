Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call(null, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `call` instead of `apply` changes how the arguments are passed to the `fulfilled` function; `call` expects individual arguments rather than an array, which could lead to unexpected results if `fulfilled` is designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind(this, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value (in this case, `this`), and the first argument set to `array`, which means the `fulfilled` function will not receive the arguments as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(array[0], array[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because directly accessing elements of the `array` assumes that it has at least two elements; if it has fewer, this will lead to an error or unexpected behavior, whereas the original code would handle any number of arguments correctly.

DONE.
