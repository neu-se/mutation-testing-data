Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to convert the string `rowStr` to uppercase before parsing, which would lead to a JSON parsing error if `rowStr` contains valid JSON data that is not in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the input to `JSON.parse` from a single string to an array of strings, which is not valid JSON and will cause a parsing error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr + 'extraData'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extraData' to `rowStr`, making it invalid JSON, which will lead to a parsing error when `JSON.parse` is called.

DONE.
