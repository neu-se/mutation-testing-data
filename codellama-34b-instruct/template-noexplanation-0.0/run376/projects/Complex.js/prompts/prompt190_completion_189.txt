  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z['re'] + 4) % 4
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses a different method to calculate the result. Instead of using the modulo operator, it adds 4 to the real part of the complex number and then uses the modulo operator to wrap the result around to the range [0, 4).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z['re'] % 4 + 4) % 4
```
