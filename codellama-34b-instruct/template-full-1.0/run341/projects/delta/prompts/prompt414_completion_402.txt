  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not take into account the possibility of negative offsets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset = Math.abs(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would interpret the offset as always positive, which is not true for general use cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset = Math.floor(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset towards negative infinity, which is not correct for all cases.

DONE.
