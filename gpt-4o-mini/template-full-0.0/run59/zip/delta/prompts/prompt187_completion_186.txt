Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandlerWrong
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent or incorrect method, which would lead to a runtime error instead of executing the intended composition logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` when calling the handler, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the handler relies on the original context of the `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.call(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the handler with `otherOp` as its context, which may cause the handler to operate on the wrong data, leading to unexpected results in the composition process.

DONE.
