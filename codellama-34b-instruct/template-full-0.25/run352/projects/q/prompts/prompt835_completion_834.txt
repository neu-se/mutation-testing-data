  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.domain` is an object, and `typeof process.domain === "object"` would evaluate to `true`, while `process.domain === undefined` would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.domain` is an object, and `typeof process.domain === "object"` would evaluate to `true`, while `process.domain !== null` would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.domain` is an object, and `typeof process.domain === "object"` would evaluate to `true`, while `process.domain.constructor !== Object` would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
