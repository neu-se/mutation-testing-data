  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if a value is a promise-like object, while `isPromise` checks if a value is an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` checks if a promise is rejected, while `!isRejected` checks if a promise is not rejected.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if the value passed to the `nearer` function is a function, while `isPromise` checks if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
