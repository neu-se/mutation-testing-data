  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` returns the property value of the first element in the set of matched elements, while `attr` returns the value of the attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` returns the value of the first element in the set of matched elements, while `attr` returns the value of the attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'new_value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the `href` attribute of the first element in the set of matched elements to `new_value`, while `attr` only returns the value of the attribute.

DONE.
