  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the first attribute of the `nextOp` object, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the length of the `attributes` property of the `nextOp` object, rather than the actual attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.map(attr => attr.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the names of the attributes, rather than the actual attributes themselves.

DONE.
