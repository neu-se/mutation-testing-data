  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones.current)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones.current` is a list of strings, but `getTimezonesMap` expects to be passed an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones.all)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones.all` is a list of objects, but `getTimezonesMap` expects to be passed an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones[id]` is an object, but `getTimezonesMap` expects to be passed a string.

DONE.
