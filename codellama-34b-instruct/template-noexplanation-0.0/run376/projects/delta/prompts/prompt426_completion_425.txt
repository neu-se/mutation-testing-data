  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the `op` object has a `delete` property that is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== null
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the `op` object has a `delete` property that is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== undefined && op.delete !== null
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the `op` object has a `delete` property that is not undefined or null.

DONE.
