  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + replacer, spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `replacer`, which could potentially alter the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, replacer, spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the first argument of `JSON.stringify()` to `null`, which could cause the function to return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer * 2, spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value of `replacer` by 2, which could cause the function to return a string that is twice as long as the original.

DONE.
