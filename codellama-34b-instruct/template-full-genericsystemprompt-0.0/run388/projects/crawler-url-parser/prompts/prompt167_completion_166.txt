  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path is a substring of the page URL path, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path starts with the page URL path, which is a different condition than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path ends with the page URL path, which is a different condition than the original code fragment.

DONE.
