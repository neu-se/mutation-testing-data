  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` will remove the key from the map, whereas `set` will update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with an undefined value will create a new entry in the map with the key and a value of `undefined`, whereas `delete` will remove the key from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with a value of `val + 1` will update the value associated with the key to `val + 1`, whereas `delete` will remove the key from the map.

DONE.
