Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different slice of the `arguments` object, which would affect the values passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
