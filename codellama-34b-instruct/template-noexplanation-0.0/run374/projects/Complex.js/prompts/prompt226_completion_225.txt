  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This will replace the square root function with the cube root function, which will produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.abs(a))
```
This will replace the square root function with the absolute value of the input, which will produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a) + 1
```
This will replace the square root function with the input plus one, which will produce a different result.

DONE.
