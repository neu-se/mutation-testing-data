  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjust() function would return 1 as the adjusted value of the longitude, instead of the actual value of the longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjust() function would receive the GeoPoint object as its input, instead of the longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjust() function would receive the latitude value as its input, instead of the longitude value.

DONE.
