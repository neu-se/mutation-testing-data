  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is not a valid function in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is not a valid function in the code snippet.

DONE.
