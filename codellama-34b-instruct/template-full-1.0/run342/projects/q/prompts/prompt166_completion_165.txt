  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the counter instead of increasing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the counter to 0 instead of increasing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the counter to Infinity instead of increasing it.

DONE.
