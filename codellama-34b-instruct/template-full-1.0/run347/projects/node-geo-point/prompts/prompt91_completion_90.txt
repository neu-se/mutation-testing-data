  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing in degrees, while this code fragment calculates the bearing in radians, resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing in degrees, while this code fragment calculates the bearing in twice the degrees, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing in degrees, while this code fragment calculates the bearing in degrees with an offset of 180 degrees, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
