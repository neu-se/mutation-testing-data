  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had no argument passed to `nextChunk()`, while this replacement code fragment passes `null` as an argument. This could potentially cause the `nextChunk()` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had no argument passed to `nextChunk()`, while this replacement code fragment passes `undefined` as an argument. This could potentially cause the `nextChunk()` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had no argument passed to `nextChunk()`, while this replacement code fragment passes `true` as an argument. This could potentially cause the `nextChunk()` function to behave differently, depending on how
