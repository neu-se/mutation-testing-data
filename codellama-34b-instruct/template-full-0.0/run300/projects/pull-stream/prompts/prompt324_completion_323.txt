  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if it's `false`. This change would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === undefined ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if it's `undefined`. This change would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.
