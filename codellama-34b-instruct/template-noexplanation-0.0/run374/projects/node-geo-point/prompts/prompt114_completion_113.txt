  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates, which will result in errors when trying to use the returned tile object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates, which will result in errors when trying to use the returned tile object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return incorrect tile coordinates, which will result in errors when trying to use the returned tile object.

DONE.
