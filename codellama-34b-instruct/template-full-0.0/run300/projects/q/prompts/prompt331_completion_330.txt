  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `resolve` function, causing it to always return `false` instead of resolving the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of the `resolve` function, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object is passed as an argument to the `resolve` function, causing the promise to be resolved with a different value than the one that was originally intended.

DONE.
