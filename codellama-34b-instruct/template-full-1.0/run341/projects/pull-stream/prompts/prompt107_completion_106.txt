  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it may cause the `drain()` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `done`, and it may cause the `drain()` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string", done
```
This would result in different behavior because `"some string"` is a different value than `null`, and it may cause the `drain()` function to behave differently.

DONE.
