  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `map` function is called with `data` as an argument, but in this modified code, `cb` is called with `data` as an argument, which would cause the `map` function to be skipped and the `asyncMap` function to return `data` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `map` function is called with `data` as an argument, but in this modified code, `cb` is called with `err` and `data` as arguments, which would cause the `map` function to be called with the wrong arguments and potentially return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `map` function is called with `data
