  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `a` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment is using the negative of `a`, which is also a complex number but with different properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `a` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment is using the sum of `a` and 1, which is also a complex number but with different properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `a` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment is using the product of `a` and 2, which is also a complex number but with different properties.

DONE.
