  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit` with `apply` will call the `emit` function with the `this` context of `Dirty` and pass on the arguments object as the only argument, whereas `this.emit` without `apply` will call the `emit` function with the `this` context of `Dirty` and pass on the individual arguments as separate parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.call(this, 'error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer));
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.call` will call the `emit` function with the `this` context of `Dirty`, and pass on 'error' and a new `Error` object as separate parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this, 'error', new Error('Cor
