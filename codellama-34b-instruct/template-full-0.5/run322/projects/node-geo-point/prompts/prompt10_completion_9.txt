  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `hasOwnProperty` check, potentially causing the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(null, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would change the value of `this` inside the `hasOwnProperty` function, potentially causing it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` function would be called with a different argument, potentially causing it to return a different result.

DONE.
