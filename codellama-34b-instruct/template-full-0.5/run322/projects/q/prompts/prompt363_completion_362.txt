  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a progressed promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a fulfilled promise with a different value.

DONE.
