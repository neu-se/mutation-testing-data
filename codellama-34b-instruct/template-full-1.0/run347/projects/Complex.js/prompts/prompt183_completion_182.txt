  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is a strict equality check, which would cause the code to behave differently when the imaginary part of the number is exactly zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['real'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `real` property of the `Complex` object is not defined, so this code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['imaginary'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `imaginary` property of the `Complex` object is not defined, so this code would throw an error.

DONE.
