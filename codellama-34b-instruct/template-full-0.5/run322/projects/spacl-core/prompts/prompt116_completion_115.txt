  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the `for...of` loop would iterate over the elements in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, so the `for...of` loop would iterate over the elements starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.filter(v => v.startsWith('d'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, so the `for...of` loop would iterate over the elements that start with the letter 'd'.

DONE.
