  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first timezone in the list, whereas the original code would return the timezone corresponding to the country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"non-existent timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, whereas the original code would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone("invalid timezone name")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null`, whereas the original code would return the timezone corresponding to the given name if it exists, or `null` otherwise.

DONE.
