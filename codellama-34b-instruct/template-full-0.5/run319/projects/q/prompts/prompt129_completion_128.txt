  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.splice(0, 0, key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the key to the beginning of the `keys` array, rather than the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `keys` array, rather than adding a new one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys[key] = value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `key` property of the `keys` array to `value`, rather than adding a new element to the array.

DONE.
