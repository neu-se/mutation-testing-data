  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinity']
```
This would result in different behavior because the "isInfinity" property is not defined for the Complex class, while the "isZero" property is. This would cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the "im" property of the Complex class represents the imaginary part of the complex number, while the "isZero" property represents whether the number is zero or not. This would cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the "re" property of the Complex class represents the real part of the complex number, while the "isZero" property represents whether the number is zero or not. This would cause the method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
