  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and return its promise, rather than using the existing `ends` deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and return its resolve function, rather than using the existing `ends` deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and return its reject function, rather than using the existing `ends` deferred object.

DONE.
