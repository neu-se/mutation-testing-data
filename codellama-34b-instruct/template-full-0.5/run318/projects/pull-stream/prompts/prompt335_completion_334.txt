  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` would pass the value of `data` to the `cb` function, while `null` would pass a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` would pass the value of `data` to the `cb` function, while `undefined` would pass an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` would pass the value of `data` to the `cb` function, while `0` would pass a zero value.

DONE.
