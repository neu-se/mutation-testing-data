 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?:wo)?mAN$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the case of the 'm' in the regular expression is changed, which would cause the function to not match the word 'woman' and not replace the 'a' with 'e'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace('a', 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of replacement is changed from a regular expression to a string, which would cause the function to replace the first occurrence of the letter 'a' instead of the letter 'a' at the end of the word 'woman'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
