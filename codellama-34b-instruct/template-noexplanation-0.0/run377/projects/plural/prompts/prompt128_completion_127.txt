  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= rules.length
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which will result in an error when trying to access the `rule` variable at the index `rules.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < rules.length - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one less time than the original code, which will result in the last rule not being applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < rules.length + 1
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one more time than the original code, which will result in an error when trying to access the `rule` variable at the index `rules.length + 1`.

DONE.
