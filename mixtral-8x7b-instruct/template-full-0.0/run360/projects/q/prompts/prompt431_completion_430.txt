 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `"rejected"`, since it's calling the `state` property on an empty object, which is always truthy and will not trigger the rejection branch in the ternary operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().thenReturn('rejected').state
