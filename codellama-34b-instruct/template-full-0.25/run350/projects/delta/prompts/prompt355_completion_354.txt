  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if it is not a number. This could cause the code to behave differently when the argument is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently when the argument is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if it is null. This could cause the code to behave differently when the argument is null.

DONE.
