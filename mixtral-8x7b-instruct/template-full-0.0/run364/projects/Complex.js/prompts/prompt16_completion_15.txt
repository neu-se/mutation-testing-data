 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the result in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root of a number, while `Math.abs` calculates the absolute value. This change would lead to incorrect results in cases where `b` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` converts a string into an integer, while `Math.abs` calculates the absolute value. This change would lead to incorrect results and possibly errors, as it expects a number as an argument.

DONE.
