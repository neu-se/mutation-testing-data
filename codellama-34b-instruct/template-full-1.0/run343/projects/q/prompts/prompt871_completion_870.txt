  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code ensures that `args` is passed to `callback`, while replacing it with `null` would cause it not to be passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` to `callback`, while replacing it with `1` would pass a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a shallow copy of `args` to `callback`, while replacing it with `args` would pass the original copy.

DONE.
