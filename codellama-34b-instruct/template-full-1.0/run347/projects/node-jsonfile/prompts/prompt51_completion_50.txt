  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is divided by 2, which would produce a different output for the `stringify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is increased by 2, which would also produce a different output for the `stringify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is multiplied by 2, which would also produce a different output for the `stringify` function.

DONE.
