  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would not iterate over the `sources` object, as `null` is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would not iterate over the `sources` object, as `undefined` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the `sources` object, but the loop would only execute once, as `0` is not a valid property name.

DONE.
