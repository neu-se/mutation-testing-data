  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.q
```
This would result in different behavior because `q` is not a property of the `timezone` object, and would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is not a property of the `timezone` object, and would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` would be treated as a variable name, and would result in a reference error if the variable `b` is not defined in the scope of the `buildTimezone` function.

DONE.
