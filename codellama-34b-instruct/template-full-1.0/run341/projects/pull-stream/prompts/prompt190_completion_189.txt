  Sure, here are three options for mutated code that would result in different behavior than the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is no longer available within the `asyncMap` function, causing any calls to it to result in a "null reference" error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = !map
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!map` operator negates the value of the `map` function, causing any calls to it to return the opposite of what they would have returned in the original code. For example, if `map` returned `true` in the original code, it would return `false` with the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is replaced with a constant `true` value, causing any calls to it to return `true` regardless of the input.
