  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` would not be passed as a second argument to `dispatch()`, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` would be passed as the first argument to `dispatch()`, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array_slice(arguments, 1), void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would be passed as the first argument to `dispatch()`, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
