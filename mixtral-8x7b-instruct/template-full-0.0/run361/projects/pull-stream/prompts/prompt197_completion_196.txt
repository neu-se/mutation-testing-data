 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if(busy)` check would be skipped, causing the `abortCb` callback to be called immediately even if the mapper is still processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if(busy === true)` check would only be true if `busy` is explicitly set to `true`, and not if it's any other truthy value. This could cause the `abortCb` callback to be called at the wrong time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof busy === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if(typeof busy === 'undefined')` check would only be true if `busy` has not been defined yet, which would cause the `abortCb` callback to be called immediately even if the mapper is not yet processing.
