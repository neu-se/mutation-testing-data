  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: zipFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the file format from tar to zip.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the file path from tarFilePath to zipFilePath.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the file format from tar to zip while keeping the same file path.

DONE.
