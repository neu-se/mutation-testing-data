 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `keys` method to the prototype of all objects, not just enumerable own properties of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
