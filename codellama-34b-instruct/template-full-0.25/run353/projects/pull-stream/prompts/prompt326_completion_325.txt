  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes one argument, but `end` and `data` are two separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end || data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || data` is a single expression that evaluates to `end` if it is truthy, and `data` otherwise. In the original code, `end` and `data` are separate arguments, so this change would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end && data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && data` is a single expression that evaluates to `end` if it is falsy, and `data` otherwise. In the original code, `end` and `data` are separate arguments, so this change would result in different behavior.

DONE.
