  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` is a function that expects an object as its argument, but `undefined` is not an object. In the original code, `object_toString` is called with `this` bound to `exception`, which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` is a function that expects an object as its argument, but `null` is not an object. In the original code, `object_toString` is called with `this` bound to `exception`, which is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` is a function that expects an object as its argument, but `1` is not an object. In the original code, `object_toString`
