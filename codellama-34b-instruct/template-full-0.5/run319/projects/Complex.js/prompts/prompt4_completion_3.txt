  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` as-is, while this replacement adds 1 to it. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` as-is, while this replacement multiplies it by 2. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x/2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` as-is, while this replacement divides it by 2. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the surrounding code.

DONE.
