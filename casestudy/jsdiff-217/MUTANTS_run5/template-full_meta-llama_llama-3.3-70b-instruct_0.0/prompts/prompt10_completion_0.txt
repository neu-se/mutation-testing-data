Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array containing the matched strings, while `split` returns an array of substrings split from the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` returns a new string with the replaced characters, while `split` returns an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, while `split` returns an array of substrings split from the original string.

DONE.
