Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's values instead of its keys, which would cause the `reduce` function to iterate over the values of `data.countries` instead of the country IDs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the iteration to only the first country ID, meaning only one country would be processed instead of all countries in `data.countries`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries).map(id => id.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the country IDs to uppercase strings, which would not match the original IDs when calling `getCountry(id, options)`, potentially leading to incorrect or missing country data.

DONE.
