Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes only a single operation instead of the entire segment of operations that are being processed, potentially losing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(index + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes one more operation than intended, which could lead to incorrect line segmentation and data representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(0));
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to push zero operations, effectively doing nothing and potentially causing the line to be empty when it should contain data.

DONE.
