  Sure, I can assist you in identifying possible options for replacing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function with a buggy code fragment. 

Option 1: It is possible to replace `getFileNameAndLineNumber` with a sub-par name that makes incorrect assumptions about the source of the stack trace:
```
// Incorrect assumption about the source of the stack trace
function getStackBottom (error) {
    var lines = error.stack.split("\n");
    var relevantLine = lines[lines.length - 1];
    return relevantLine;
}
```

This code assumes that the last line of the error stack is the real source of the issue, which might not be the case. The `getStackBottom` function may produce incorrect results, indicating the wrong line of code.

Option 2: It is possible to replace `getFileNameAndLineNumber` with a function that extracts only the filename from the stack trace, ignoring the line number:
```
// Ignores the line number in the stack trace
function getFileName (error) {
    var lines = error.stack.split("\n");
    var
