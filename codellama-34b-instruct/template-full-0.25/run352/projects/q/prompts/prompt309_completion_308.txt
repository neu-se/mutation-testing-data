  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will throw an error, which will be caught by the `catch` block and the promise will be rejected with the error as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(1)` returns a promise that is already resolved with the value `1`, so the promise returned by `race` will also be resolved with the value `1`.

DONE.
