  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing an extra argument to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "extra"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing an extra argument to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing a `null` argument to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to fail.

DONE.
