  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor !== Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor` would refer to the constructor function of the object, which is not necessarily the same as the `Complex` constructor function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.name !== 'Complex'
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor.name` would refer to the name of the constructor function, which is not necessarily the same as the name of the `Complex` constructor function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.prototype !== Complex.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor.prototype` would refer to the prototype object of the constructor function, which is not necessarily the same as the prototype object of the `Complex` constructor function.

DONE.
