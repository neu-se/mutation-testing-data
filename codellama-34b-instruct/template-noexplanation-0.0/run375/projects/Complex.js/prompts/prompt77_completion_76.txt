  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This will increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, which will cause the loop to skip over every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This will decrement the value of `i` by 1, which will cause the loop to iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This will set the value of `i` to 0, which will cause the loop to start over from the beginning of the array.

DONE.
