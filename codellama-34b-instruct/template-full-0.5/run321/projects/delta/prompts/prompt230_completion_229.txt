  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used to determine the length of the string, but `0` is a falsy value and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, resulting in the `insert` block not being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used to determine the length of the string, but `1` is a truthy value and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, resulting in the `insert` block being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used to determine the length of the string, but `'0'` is a truthy value and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, resulting in the `insert` block being executed.

DONE.
