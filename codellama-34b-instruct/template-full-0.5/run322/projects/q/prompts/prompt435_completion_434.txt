  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `emit` property of the `process` object is equal to the string `"function"`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === process.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `emit` property of the `process` object is equal to itself, which is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `emit` property of the `process` object is not equal to the string `"function"`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
