  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a dummy error message, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with the size of the data object, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with the size of the queue object, which would not occur in the original code.

DONE.
