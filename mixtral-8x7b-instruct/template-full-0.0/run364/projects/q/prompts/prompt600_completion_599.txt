 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects two arguments, but it would receive `op` and `args` as properties of a null object, causing a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` would be treated as elements of an array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{op: 'get', args: ['property']}
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` would be replaced with a single object that has `op` and `args` as properties. This would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently than intended, as it expects `op` and `args` to be separate arguments.

DONE.
