  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method would create a new instance of the `ctx` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the `query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.deepClone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deepClone()` method would create a new instance of the `ctx` object and all of its properties, which could potentially change the behavior of the `query()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone(true)` method would create a new instance of the `ctx` object and all of its properties, which could potentially change the behavior of the `query()` method.

DONE.
