  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `callback` is a function that returns a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` is the first argument passed to the `dispatch` function, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is the context in which the `dispatch` function is called, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the result of the operation.

DONE.
