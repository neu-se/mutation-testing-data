  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, while `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the callback function to be passed as the first argument instead of the last, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of an array, while `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the callback function to be removed from the argument list, which could result in a different return value or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes and returns the first element of an array, while `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the callback function to be removed from the argument list, which could
