  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not consider the case where `a[key]` is `null`, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not consider the case where `b[key]` is `undefined`, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.
