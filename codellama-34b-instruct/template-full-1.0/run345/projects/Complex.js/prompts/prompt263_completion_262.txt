  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the arctangent of `b / a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the arctangent of `b / (a + 1)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the arctangent of `b / a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the arctangent of `a / b` and then doubles the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b - a, b + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the arctangent of `b / a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the arctangent of `(b - a) / (b + a)`.
