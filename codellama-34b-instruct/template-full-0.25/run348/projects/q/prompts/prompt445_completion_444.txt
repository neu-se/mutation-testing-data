  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because "rejectionHandled" is a different event than "unhandledRejection", and would not trigger the same behavior in the process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise argument is null, which would not trigger the same behavior in the process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise argument is a rejected promise, which would not trigger the same behavior in the process.

DONE.
