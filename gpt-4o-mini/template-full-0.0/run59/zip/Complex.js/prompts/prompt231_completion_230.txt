Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the imaginary part `b` to using the real part `a`, which would lead to incorrect results when calculating the square root of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the imaginary part by adding 1, which would incorrectly affect the calculation of the square root, potentially leading to an incorrect complex result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the imaginary part `b`, which would alter the calculation of the square root and yield an incorrect complex number as a result.

DONE.
