  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, rather than just the individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `length` property of the `arguments` object, rather than the actual arguments themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `arguments` object starting from the second element, rather than from the first element.

DONE.
