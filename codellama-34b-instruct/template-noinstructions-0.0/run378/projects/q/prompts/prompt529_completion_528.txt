  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would not be called with the correct argument, which could cause the `master` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called with a `null` argument, which could cause the `master` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called with an `undefined` argument, which could cause the `master` function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
