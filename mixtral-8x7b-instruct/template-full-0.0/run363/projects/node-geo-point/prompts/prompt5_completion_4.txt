 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input is an array instead of an object, potentially causing incorrect behavior or errors in the `fromGeoJSON` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(input) => typeof input === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check if the input is not null, allowing null values to pass through and potentially causing errors in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(input) => typeof input === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input is a function instead of an object, causing the `fromGeoJSON` method to fail and potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

DONE.
