  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a local variable in the `fbind` function, and it would not have the same value as `arguments` in the outer scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special object that contains the arguments passed to the function, and it would not have the same value as `args` in the inner scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.arguments` is a property of the `Promise.prototype` object, and it would not have the same value as `arguments` in the outer scope.

DONE.
