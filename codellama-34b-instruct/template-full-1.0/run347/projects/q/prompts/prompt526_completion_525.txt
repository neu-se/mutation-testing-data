  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would resolve with `null` instead of the original `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would resolve with `undefined` instead of the original `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would resolve with an empty array `[]` instead of the original `args` array.

DONE.
