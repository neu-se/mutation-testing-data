  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._readStream);
```
This change will cause the `read_close` event to be emitted with the `_readStream` object as an argument, which is different from the original code where `this.emit` was called without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._writeStream);
```
This change will cause the `read_close` event to be emitted with the `_writeStream` object as an argument, which is different from the original code where `this.emit` was called without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data);
```
This change will cause the `read_close` event to be emitted with the `_data` object as an argument, which is different from the original code where `this.emit` was called without any arguments.

DONE.
