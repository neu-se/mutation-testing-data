  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would nullify the head.task property, leading to a loss of information and potentially causing bugs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = head.task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the head.task property to the task variable, changing the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.next = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the linked list from being iterated, causing errors in the program.

DONE.
