  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `null` values in `a` to be overwritten by `undefined` values in `b`, whereas the original code fragment would only overwrite `undefined` values in `a` with `undefined` values in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only overwrite values in `a` with values in `b` if both values are defined, whereas the original code fragment would overwrite values in `a` with values in `b` even if one of the values is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only overwrite values in `a` with `null` values in `b`, whereas the original code fragment would overwrite
