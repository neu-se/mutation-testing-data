  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function expects an array of promises, but `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function expects an array of promises, but `undefined` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function expects an array of promises, but `[]` is an empty array, which would cause the `all` function to immediately resolve with an empty array, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.

DONE.
