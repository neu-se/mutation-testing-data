  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `args` array, which may be important for the function's intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add additional elements to the `args` array, which may be important for the function's intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the values of the `args` array, which may be important for the function's intended behavior.

DONE.
