Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._settings.positivePatterns
```
This would result in different behavior because it is using a non-existent property `positivePatterns` of the `_settings` object instead of the `negative` array, potentially leading to incorrect filtering or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
positive
```
This would result in different behavior because it is using the `positive` array instead of the `negative` array, effectively inverting the filtering logic and potentially allowing unwanted entries to pass through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it is using an empty array instead of the `negative` array, potentially allowing all entries to pass through the filter without being properly checked against the negative patterns.

DONE.
