  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, while `<` is the less than operator, which would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the deferred object with the value provided as an argument, while `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the value provided as an argument, while `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

DONE.
