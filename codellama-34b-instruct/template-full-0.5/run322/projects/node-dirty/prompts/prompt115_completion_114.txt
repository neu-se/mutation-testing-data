  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of arrays, not objects, and would cause an error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size()` is a method of the `Map` class, not an object property, and would cause an error in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of arrays, not objects, and would cause an error in the code.

DONE.
