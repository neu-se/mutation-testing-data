  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for strict equality, whereas the new code fragment checks for greater than equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between a and 1, whereas the new code fragment checks for equality between a and b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between a and 1, whereas the new code fragment checks for equality between a and b, then adds a and b and checks for equality with 1.

DONE.
