  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid value for `verbs` in the `Queryable` interface.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid value for `verbs` in the `Queryable` interface.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"INVALID"
```
This would result in different behavior because "INVALID" is a string, and it is not a valid value for `verbs` in the `Queryable` interface.

DONE.
