  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string into the props array, rather than just the part after the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1, -1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string onto the props array, but without the first and last characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.replace(/^.|\W/g, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string onto the props array, but without any leading or trailing whitespace or punctuation.

DONE.
