  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(1).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `startsWith` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `startsWith` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(100).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `startsWith` method to return a different result.

DONE.
