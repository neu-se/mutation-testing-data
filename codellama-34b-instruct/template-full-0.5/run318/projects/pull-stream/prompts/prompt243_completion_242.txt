  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `abort` signal, causing the code to continue executing even if the stream has been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, causing the code to always abort the current stream and move on to the next one, regardless of whether the previous stream has been aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, causing the code to never abort the current stream, even if the previous stream has been aborted.

DONE.
