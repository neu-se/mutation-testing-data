  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function would receive `null` as an argument instead of the original `value`, which could cause it to return a different value or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function would receive the string `"<PLACEHOLDER>"` as an argument instead of the original `value`, which could cause it to return a different value or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function would receive `value + 1` as an argument instead of the original `value`, which could cause it to return a different value or throw an error.

DONE.
