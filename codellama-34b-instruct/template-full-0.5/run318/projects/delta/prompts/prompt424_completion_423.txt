  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset <= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the code to behave differently for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset >= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the code to behave differently for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset !== index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the code to behave differently for certain input values.

DONE.
