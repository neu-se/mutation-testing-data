  
Option 1: The replacement is:
```

   if(sum==1092){
        sum=0
    }
```
This is incorrect, as} will always evaluate to true if the sum equals 1092.

Option 2: The replacement is:
```

    sum=sum-1
```
This is incorrect, as it will always evaluate to the same sum regardless of the input.

Option 3: The replacement is:
```

if(sum%2==0){
sum=sum/2
}
```
This is incorrect, as it will always evaluate to the same sum regardless of the input.

DONE.
