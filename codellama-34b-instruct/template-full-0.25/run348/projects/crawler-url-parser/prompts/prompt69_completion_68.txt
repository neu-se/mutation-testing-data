  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the URL, which could cause the `parse` function to fail if it relies on the protocol to determine the URL's format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol with `ftp://`, which could cause the `parse` function to fail if it does not support the `ftp` protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'file://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol with `file://`, which could cause the `parse` function to fail if it does not support the `file` protocol.

DONE.
