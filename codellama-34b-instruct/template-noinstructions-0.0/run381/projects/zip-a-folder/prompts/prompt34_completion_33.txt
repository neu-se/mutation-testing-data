  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the archive is finalized and all data has been written, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error during the archiving process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the archive is finalized and all data has been written, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error during the archiving process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error during the archiving process.

DONE.
