  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the line and start at the second character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the attributes if the next character has attributes, and would return an empty object otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(1).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the attributes of the next character, or if it doesn't have attributes, it would return the attributes of the character after that.

DONE.
