Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split('\n').join(EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method of replacing newlines from a direct replacement to a split-and-join approach, which may not handle cases where the string contains multiple consecutive newlines correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/,/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces commas with the end-of-line character instead of replacing newlines, which would fundamentally alter the structure of the JSON string representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.concat(EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the EOL string to the end of the JSON string instead of replacing newlines, which would not modify the internal structure of the JSON string at all.

DONE.
