  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would now check for the presence of the `promise` object in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking for the presence of the `promise` object's rejected state. As a result, the `unhandledRejections` array would not be correctly updated to reflect the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isRejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.isRejected()` function would now check the state of the `promise` object directly, rather than checking for the presence of the `promise` object in the `unhandledRejections` array. As a result, the `unhandledRejections` array would not be correctly updated to reflect the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
