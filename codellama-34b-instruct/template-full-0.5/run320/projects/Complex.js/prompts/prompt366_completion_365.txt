  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `a` was equal to 0, but the modified code fragment would check if `a + 1` was equal to 0, which is a different condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `a` was equal to 0, but the modified code fragment would check if `b` was equal to 0, which is a different condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `a` was equal to 0, but the modified code fragment would check if `a - b` was equal to 0, which is a different condition.

DONE.
