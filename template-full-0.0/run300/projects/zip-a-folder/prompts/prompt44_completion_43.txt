  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` expects a file path as its first argument, whereas `zipArchive.directory` expects a directory path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory` with the `recursive` option set to `true` would recursively add all files and subdirectories in the specified directory, whereas the original code only adds the files in the specified directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false, {
    ignore: (file) => file.isDirectory(),
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory` with the `ignore` option set to a function that ignores directories would only add files in the specified directory, whereas the original code adds both files and directories.
