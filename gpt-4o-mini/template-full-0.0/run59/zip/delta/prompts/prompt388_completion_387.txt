Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length of 1 for the operation, potentially causing incorrect transformations when the actual length of the operation is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length used for the transformation by 1, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations, especially when the lengths of the operations are critical for maintaining the correct state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length used for the transformation by 1, which could cause some operations to be skipped or incorrectly transformed, leading to unexpected results in the final delta.

DONE.
