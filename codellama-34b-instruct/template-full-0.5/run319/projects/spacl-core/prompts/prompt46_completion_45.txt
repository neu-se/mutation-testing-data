  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/` matches a wider range of characters than the original regular expression `/^\//`, which only matches a forward slash. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` for more cases, potentially leading to a different path being taken in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\//` only matches a forward slash at the beginning of a string, whereas the original regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/` matches a wider range of characters. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for more cases, potentially leading to a different path being taken in the code.
