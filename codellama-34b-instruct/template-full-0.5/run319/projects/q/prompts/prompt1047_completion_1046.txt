  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an error object, but `null` would be a valid value that the code would not be able to handle correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an error object, but `undefined` would be a valid value that the code would not be able to handle correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an error object with a specific message, but the new error object would have a different message.

DONE.
