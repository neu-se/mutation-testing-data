  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.message` is a string that represents the error message, whereas `reason.stack` is a string that represents the stack trace of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.code
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.code` is a number that represents the error code, whereas `reason.stack` is a string that represents the stack trace of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.name` is a string that represents the name of the error, whereas `reason.stack` is a string that represents the stack trace of the error.

DONE.
