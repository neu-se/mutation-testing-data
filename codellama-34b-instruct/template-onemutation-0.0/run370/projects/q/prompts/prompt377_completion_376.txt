  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `newValue` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Using `null` instead would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
