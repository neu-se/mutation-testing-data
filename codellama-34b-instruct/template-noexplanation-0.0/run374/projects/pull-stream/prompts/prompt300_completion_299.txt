  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This change will cause the function to return the opposite value of what it should, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than what it should, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || end
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than what it should, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

DONE.
