  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would start at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would have the wrong length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would have the wrong length and start at the wrong index.

DONE.
