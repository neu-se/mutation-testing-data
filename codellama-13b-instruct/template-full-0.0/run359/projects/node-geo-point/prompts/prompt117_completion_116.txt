  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, while `this.latitude` refers to the `latitude` property of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1` is a different variable than `this`, and the `calculateDestination` method is called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2` is a different variable than `this`, and the `calculateDestination` method is called with a different argument.

DONE.
