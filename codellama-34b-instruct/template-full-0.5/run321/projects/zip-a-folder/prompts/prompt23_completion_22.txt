  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.pipe(output);
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.pipe` is not a valid method for the `archiver` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.pipe(output, { end: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` option is set to `false`, which would cause the output stream to not be closed when the archive is finalized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.pipe(output, { finish: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` option is set to `true`, which would cause the output stream to be closed when the archive is finalized, rather than when the `end` event is emitted.

DONE.
