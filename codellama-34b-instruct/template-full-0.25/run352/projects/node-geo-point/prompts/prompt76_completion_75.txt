  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the value of `θ` to the nearest integer, while this modified code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the value of `θ` to the nearest integer and then convert it to a string. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result when the `bearing` parameter is a decimal value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ.toFixed(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Number` to convert the value of `θ` to a number, while this modified code fragment uses `toFixed` to convert the value of `θ` to a string with two decimal places. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result when the `bearing` parameter is a decimal value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
