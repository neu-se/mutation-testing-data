  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<decodedBasename>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string "<decodedBasename>" as the destination filename, regardless of the actual filename extracted from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(path.dirname(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the parent directory of the destination path as the destination filename, rather than the basename of the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the destination path as the destination filename, rather than the basename of the URL path.

DONE.
