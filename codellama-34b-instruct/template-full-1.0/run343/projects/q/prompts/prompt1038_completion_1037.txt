  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a promise that is rejected, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that creates a promise that is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, whereas `Q.defer` returns an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.r` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `Q.defer` returns an object.

DONE.
