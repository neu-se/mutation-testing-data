 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for equality instead of greater than, potentially causing the function to return `cb(true)` prematurely or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for greater than or equal to, potentially causing the function to return `cb(true)` one iteration too early or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 > max
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the value of `i` before the comparison, potentially causing the function to return `cb(true)` one iteration too late or not at all.

DONE.
