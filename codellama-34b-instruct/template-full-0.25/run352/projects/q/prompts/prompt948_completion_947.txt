  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function as the last argument to the `callback` function, which is necessary for the `nodeArgs` array to be properly populated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `nodeArgs` array as the arguments to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(thisp, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array as the arguments to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
