  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return a different value, potentially causing the loop to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return a different value, potentially causing the loop to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the loop to execute differently.

DONE.
