  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 0 to `z['im']`, regardless of the input string, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `i` without checking if it is a valid index in the `tokens` array, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `tokens[i + 1]` to `z['re']`, regardless of the input string, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
