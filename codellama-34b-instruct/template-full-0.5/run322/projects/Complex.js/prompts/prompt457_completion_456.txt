  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any complex number, even if it is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for any complex number, even if it is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any complex number, even if it is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
