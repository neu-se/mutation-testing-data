  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from the longitude of `point1` instead of its latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from a random number between 0 and 1 instead of the actual latitude of `point1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(sin(π / 2), cos(π / 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from a fixed value that is not related to the latitude of `point1`.
