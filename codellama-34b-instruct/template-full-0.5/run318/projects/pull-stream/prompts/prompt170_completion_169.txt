  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call the callback with `true` when the array is exhausted, while this modified code would call it with `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would increment `i` before calling the callback, while this modified code would call the callback with the same value of `i` each time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call the callback with the same value of `i` each time, while this modified code would increment `i` before calling the callback.

DONE.
