  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would trigger a different branch of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value that is not the same as `null` or `undefined`, and it would trigger a different branch of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", and it would trigger a different branch of the `if` statement.

DONE.
