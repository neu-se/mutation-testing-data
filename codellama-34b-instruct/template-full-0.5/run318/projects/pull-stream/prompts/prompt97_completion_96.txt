  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `ended` was originally `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `ended` was originally `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `ended` was originally `false` or any other value that is not strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
