  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. In the original code, the function would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` if `a` or `b` is infinite, but not if both are infinite.

DONE.
