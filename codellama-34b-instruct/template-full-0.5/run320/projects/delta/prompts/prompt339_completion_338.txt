  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first character of the slice, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the previous character in the slice, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next 10 characters in the slice, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
