  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude + 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but this replacement code fragment adds 180 to the longitude values before converting them to radians. This would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but this replacement code fragment subtracts 180 from the longitude values before converting them to radians. This would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 180 degrees in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
