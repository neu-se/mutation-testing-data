  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0];
```
This change will cause the loop to only iterate over the first verb in the `verbs` array, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[verbs.length - 1];
```
This change will cause the loop to only iterate over the last verb in the `verbs` array, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[Math.floor(Math.random() * verbs.length)];
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over a random verb from the `verbs` array, rather than all of them.

DONE.
