  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the `args` array to the `promiseDispatch` method, rather than passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(args[0], args[1], args[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the first element of the `args` array and pass the second and third elements to the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(args[0], args[0] + args[1], args[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a modified version of the `args` array to the `promiseDispatch` method, with the second element being the sum of the first two elements of the original `args` array.

DONE.
