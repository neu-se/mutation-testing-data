  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `isNaN()`, returning `true` if the number is not NaN, and `false` if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if a number is finite, whereas `isNaN()` checks if a number is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the number is not equal to 0, rather than checking if the number is NaN.

DONE.
