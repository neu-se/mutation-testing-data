  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"newName"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with the new name "newName" instead of the original name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with a null name instead of the original name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with an undefined name instead of the original name.

DONE.
