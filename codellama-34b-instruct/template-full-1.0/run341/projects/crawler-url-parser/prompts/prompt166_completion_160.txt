  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not detect the sub-level relationship between the two URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not detect the super-level relationship between the two URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not detect the sub-level relationship between the two URLs.

DONE.
