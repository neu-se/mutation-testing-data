  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line was checking whether the peeked type was not 'insert', while this code fragment checks whether there is a next operation, which could be of any type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line was checking whether the peeked type was not 'insert', while this code fragment checks whether the length of the peeked operation is greater than 0, which could be true for any type of operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek() != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line was checking whether the peeked type was not 'insert', while this code fragment checks whether the peeked operation is not null, which could be true for any type of operation.

DONE.
