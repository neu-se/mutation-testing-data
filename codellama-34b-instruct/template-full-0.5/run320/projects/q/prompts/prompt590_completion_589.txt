  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `makeGenerator` is a function that is not bound to any context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.call(this)` calls the `makeGenerator` function with the current `this` context as its `this` argument, whereas `makeGenerator` is a function that is not called with any specific `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.apply(this, [])` calls the `makeGenerator` function with the current `this` context as its `this` argument and an empty array as its argument list, whereas `makeGenerator` is a function that is
