  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a different method than `indexOf`, and it returns a boolean value indicating whether the specified value is present in the string or not, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, or -1 if it's not found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` is a different method than `indexOf`, and it returns a boolean value indicating whether the string starts with the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, or -1 if it's not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` is a different method than `indexOf`, and it returns a boolean value indicating whether the string ends with the specified value, whereas `indexOf
