  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds down to the nearest integer, which can result in a different precision value being used for the adjustment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the precision value, which can result in a higher precision being used for the adjustment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-precision
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the precision value, which can result in a different precision being used for the adjustment.

DONE.
