  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a rejected promise, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a resolved promise, but the `fulfilled` callback would not be called because the value of the promise is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a resolved promise, but the `fulfilled` callback would not be called because the value of the promise is `null`.

DONE.
