 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is not propagated or emitted, causing potential issues to go unnoticed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is passed instead of an error, which might not trigger proper error handling or alert developers to missing or incorrect data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a no-op function is passed instead of an error, which might not trigger proper error handling or alert developers to missing or incorrect data.

DONE.
