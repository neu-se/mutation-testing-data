Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `get` method instead of the `dispatch` method, which would lead to an error if `get` is not defined on the Promise prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the current context, which may not behave the same way as the original `dispatch` method when called, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly call `dispatch` with additional arguments, which would not match the expected signature and could lead to errors or unintended behavior.

DONE.
