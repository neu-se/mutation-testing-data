  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `arguments.length` is a number that represents the number of arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` is the first argument passed to a function, while `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[arguments.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[arguments.length - 1]` is the last argument passed to a function, while `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
