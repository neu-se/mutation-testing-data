  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in a different calculation of the tangent, which could potentially lead to a different result in the asin function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in a different calculation of the tangent, which could potentially lead to a different result in the acos function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in a different calculation of the tangent, which could potentially lead to a different result in the atanh function.

DONE.
