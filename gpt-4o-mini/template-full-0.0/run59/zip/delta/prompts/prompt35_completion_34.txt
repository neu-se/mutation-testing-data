Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the function to proceed when `b` is not an object, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors when trying to access properties of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` as a valid input, allowing the function to continue execution even when `b` is `null`, which could lead to runtime errors when attempting to access properties on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `b` is an array, allowing non-object types (like strings or numbers) to pass through, which could cause the function to behave incorrectly when it expects `b` to be an object.

DONE.
