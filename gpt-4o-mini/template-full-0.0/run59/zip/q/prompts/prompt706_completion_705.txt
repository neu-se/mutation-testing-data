Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array instead of concatenating it with the new arguments, potentially leading to missing arguments in the final function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.reverse()` modifies the original `args` array in place and returns the reversed array, which would change the order of the arguments passed to the dispatched function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([null])` appends a `null` value to the `args` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function being called does not handle `null` as a valid argument.

DONE.
