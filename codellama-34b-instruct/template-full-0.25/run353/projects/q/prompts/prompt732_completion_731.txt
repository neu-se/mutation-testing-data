  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the array of promises if `pendingCount` is 0, but this replacement would resolve the promise with the array of promises if `pendingCount` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the array of promises if `pendingCount` is 0, but this replacement would resolve the promise with the array of promises if `pendingCount` is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the array of promises if `pendingCount` is 0, but this replacement would resolve the promise with the array of promises if `pendingCount` is not equal to 0.
