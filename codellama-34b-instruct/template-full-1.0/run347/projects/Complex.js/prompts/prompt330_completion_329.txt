  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(Math.sin(a) * sinh(b), Math.cos(a) * cosh(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the sin and cos functions is flipped, which changes the result of the complex multiplication.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(Math.sin(a) * cosh(b), Math.cos(a) * sinh(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the cos and sin functions is swapped, which changes the result of the complex multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(Math.sin(a) * cosh(b), Math.cos(a) * -sinh(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the sinh function is flipped, which changes the result of the complex multiplication.

DONE.
