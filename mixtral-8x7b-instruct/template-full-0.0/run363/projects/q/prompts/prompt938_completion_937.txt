 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object and then slices it, instead of directly slicing the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.call(arguments, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply` method to call the `slice` method of the `Array` prototype with `arguments` as the `this` value and an array containing the number 1 as the arguments, instead of directly slicing the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method to concatenate an empty array with an array created by spreading the `arguments` object, instead of directly slicing the arguments object.

DONE.
