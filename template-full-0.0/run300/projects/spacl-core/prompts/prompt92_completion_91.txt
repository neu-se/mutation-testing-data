  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method would return a new array with the first element removed, causing the loop to skip the first policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would return a new array with the elements in reverse order, causing the loop to iterate over the policies in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'admin'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would return a new array with only the policies that have a name that is not 'admin', causing the loop to skip over any policies with the name 'admin'.

DONE.
