  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would remove the last character of the `linkurl_path` string, which could potentially change the result of the includes method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").filter(Boolean).join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the split and filter methods would remove any empty strings from the `linkurl_path` string, and the join method would then join the remaining strings without any delimiters, which could potentially change the result of the includes method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/).pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the match method would return an array of strings that match the regular expression, and the pop method would then remove the last element of the array, which could potentially change the result of
