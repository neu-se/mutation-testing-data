  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises` is a pending promise that is not resolved, while `null` is a resolved promise with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises` is a pending promise that is not resolved, while `undefined` is a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises` is a pending promise that is not resolved, while `Promise.reject()` is a rejected promise with no value.

DONE.
