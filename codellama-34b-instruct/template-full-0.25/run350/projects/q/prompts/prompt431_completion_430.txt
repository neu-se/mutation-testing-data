  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` would be bound to the current context, whereas `this.inspect()` would call the `inspect` method on the current context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.call(null)` would call the `inspect` method on `null`, whereas `this.inspect()` would call the `inspect` method on the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.apply(null)` would call the `inspect` method on `null`, whereas `this.inspect()` would call the `inspect` method on the current context.

DONE.
