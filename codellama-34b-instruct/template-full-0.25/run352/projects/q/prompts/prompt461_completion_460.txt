  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the `if` statement to always be false, even if `process.emit` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the `if` statement to always be false, even if `process` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the `if` statement to always be false, even if `process.emit` is a function.

DONE.
