  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.text
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, which is not the same as the `text` property of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$(this)` selector returns the current element, which is not the same as the `text` property of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('text')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$(this)` selector returns the current element, which does not have an `attr` method that takes a `text` argument.

DONE.
