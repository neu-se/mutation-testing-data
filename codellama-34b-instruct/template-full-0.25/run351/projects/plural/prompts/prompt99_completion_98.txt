  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different character than the original code fragment, which would cause the regular expression to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a|b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match either the character "a" or the character "b", whereas the original code fragment only matches the character "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[ab]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match either the character "a" or the character "b", whereas the original code fragment only matches the character "a".

DONE.
