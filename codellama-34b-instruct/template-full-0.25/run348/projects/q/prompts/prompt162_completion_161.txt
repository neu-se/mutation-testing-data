  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with a regular expression, while this replacement uses a string as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.match(/\n/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method to split the string into an array of lines, while this replacement uses the `match` method to find all occurrences of the newline character and returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.replace(/\n/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method to split the string into an array of lines, while this replacement uses the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of the newline character and returns the modified string.

DONE.
