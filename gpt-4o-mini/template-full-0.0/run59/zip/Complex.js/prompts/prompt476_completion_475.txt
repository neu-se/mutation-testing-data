Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if the real part is equal to Infinity, which would return true only for that specific case, rather than checking if both parts are finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is not null, which is not a valid check for finiteness and would always return true for any number, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite(this['re']) || !isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR instead of AND, meaning it would return true if either part is not finite, which is the opposite of the intended check for both parts being finite.

DONE.
