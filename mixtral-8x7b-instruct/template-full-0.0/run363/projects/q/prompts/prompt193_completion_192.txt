 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec(stackLine)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the matched string instead of the array of matched groups, which would cause `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `[null, null]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the argument to `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function, causing it to return `[null, null]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec("some string")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a static string as the argument to `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function, causing it to return `["some string", null]` instead of the actual file name
