  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses a different regular expression to replace the protocol in the URL. The regular expression `/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/` matches the start of the string if it is not followed by a protocol (e.g. "http://" or "https://"). This ensures that the URL is properly formatted, even if the user enters a URL without a protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This code fragment is similar to the first option, but it replaces the protocol with "https://" instead of "http://". This is useful if the user wants to ensure that the URL is secure, even if the original URL does not specify a protocol.
