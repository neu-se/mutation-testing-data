 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the target object to `null`, which might not have the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the return value in a promise, which might not have the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy function'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the target object with a buggy function that throws an error, instead of invoking the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
