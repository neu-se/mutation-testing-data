  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given substring or -1 if not found, while `match()` method returns an array of matches or null if not found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given substring or -1 if not found, while `match()` method returns an array of matches or null if not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the given substring is present in the original string, while `match()` method returns an array of matches or null if not found.

DONE.
