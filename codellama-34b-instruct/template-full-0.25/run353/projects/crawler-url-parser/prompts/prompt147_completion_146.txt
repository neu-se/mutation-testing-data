  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `linkurl_path` into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of substrings separated by the "/" character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `linkurl_path` into an array of substrings separated by spaces, rather than an array of substrings separated by the "/" character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("\\")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `linkurl_path` into an array of substrings separated by backslashes, rather than an array of substrings separated by the "/" character.

DONE.
