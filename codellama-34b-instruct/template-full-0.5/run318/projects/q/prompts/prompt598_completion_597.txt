  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is being used as a key to access the `deferred` object, and adding 1 to it would cause it to access a different key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is being used as a key to access the `deferred` object, and subtracting 1 from it would cause it to access a different key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is being used as a key to access the `deferred` object, and multiplying it by 2 would cause it to access a different key.

DONE.
