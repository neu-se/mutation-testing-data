  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + "imagineASuffix"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute the method named "imaginaSuffix" instead of the method named "op".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute the method named "OP" instead of the method named "op".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute the method named "42" instead of the method named "op".

DONE.
