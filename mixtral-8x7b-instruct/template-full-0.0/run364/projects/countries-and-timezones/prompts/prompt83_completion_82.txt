This would result in different behavior because the `getCountriesForTimezone` function would return an array of timezone objects instead of country objects. This is because the `getTimezone` function is used to build the timezone object, which is then used to fetch the countries associated with that timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return an empty array, regardless of the input `tzName`. This is because an empty arrow function is being returned instead of the result of the `getTime
