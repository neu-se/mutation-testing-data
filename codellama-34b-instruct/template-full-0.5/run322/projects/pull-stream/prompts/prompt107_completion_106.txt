  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `drain` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to the `onEnd` function.

DONE.
