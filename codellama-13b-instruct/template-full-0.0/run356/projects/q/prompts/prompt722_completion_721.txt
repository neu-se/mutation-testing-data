  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(promise) &&
                (snapshot = promise.inspect()).state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is a promise and if its state is fulfilled, while the buggy code fragment checks if the promise is a promise and if its state is fulfilled, but also checks if the promise is a promise and if its state is fulfilled. This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(promise) &&
                (snapshot = promise.inspect()).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is a promise and if its state is fulfilled, while the buggy code fragment checks if the promise is a promise and if its state is rejected. This would result in the opposite behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
