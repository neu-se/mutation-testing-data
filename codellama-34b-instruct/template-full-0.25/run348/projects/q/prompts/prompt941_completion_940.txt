  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` to be in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(array_slice)` would concatenate the `array_slice` with itself, resulting in a larger array with duplicate values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(value) { return value !== void 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(value) { return value !== void 0; })` would remove any `undefined` values from the `array_slice`, which could cause the `nodeArgs` to be incomplete.

DONE.
