  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function and `object.inspect()` is a function call, which would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.call()` is a function call that would return a different value than `object.inspect()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.apply()` is a function call that would return a different value than `object.inspect()`.

DONE.
