  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.filter(attr => attr !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any attributes with a value of `null`, which could cause the `compose` function to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.map(attr => attr.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would convert all attribute names to lowercase, which could cause the `compose` function to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.filter(attr => attr !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any attributes with a value of `undefined`, which could cause the `compose` function to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
