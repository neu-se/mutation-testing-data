  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
