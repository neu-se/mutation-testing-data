Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `val` is `null` instead of `undefined`, meaning that a value of `undefined` would not trigger the deletion of the key from `_data`, potentially leading to unexpected data retention.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from `_data` if `val` is anything other than `undefined`, which could lead to unintended deletions if a valid value is passed that is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key already exists in `_data` instead of checking the value of `val`, which would prevent deletion of the key if it is already present, regardless of the value being `undefined`.

DONE.
