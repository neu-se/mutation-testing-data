Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of emitting an 'error' event when an error occurs, it would emit a 'warning' event, potentially leading to the error being ignored or not handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an 'info' event instead of an 'error' event, which may mislead the consumers of this event into thinking that the operation was successful or non-critical, rather than indicating an actual error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'fail'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'fail' event, which may not be handled by the existing error handling logic, leading to unhandled errors and potentially causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
