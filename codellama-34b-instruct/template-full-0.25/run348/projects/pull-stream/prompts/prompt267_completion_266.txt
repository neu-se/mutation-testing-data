  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is not `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is not `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is not `true`.

DONE.
