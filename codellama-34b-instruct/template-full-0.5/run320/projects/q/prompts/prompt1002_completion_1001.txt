  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would be replaced with the `get` method, which would cause the code to fail because the `get` method does not accept the same arguments as the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would be replaced with the `put` method, which would cause the code to fail because the `put` method does not accept the same arguments as the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would be replaced with the `delete` method, which would cause the code to fail because the `delete` method does not accept the same arguments as the `post` method.

DONE.
