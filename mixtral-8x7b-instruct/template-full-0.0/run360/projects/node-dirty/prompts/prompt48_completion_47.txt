 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key, this._data.get(key), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly returns the value from the in-memory cache, bypassing the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key, updater(this._data.get(key)), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the value from the in-memory cache and passes it to the `updater` function, but it does not update the cache with the result of the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key, updater(key), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `key` instead of the actual value to the `updater` function, which might cause unexpected behavior in the `updater` function.

DONE.
