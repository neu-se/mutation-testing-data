 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `isNaN(1)` would always be false, causing the function to return a complex number with NaN values for real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `isNaN('foo')` would always be true, causing the function to return the string 'foo' instead of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `isNaN(this.re)` would always be false, causing the function to return a complex number with NaN values for real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
