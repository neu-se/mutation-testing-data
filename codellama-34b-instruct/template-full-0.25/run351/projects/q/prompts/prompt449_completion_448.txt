  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("test");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("test");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Promise.reject("test");
});

DONE.
