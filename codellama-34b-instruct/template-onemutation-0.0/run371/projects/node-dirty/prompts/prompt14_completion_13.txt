  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pushes the callback function to the `cbs` array if it is not already present, while the modified code fragment always pushes the callback function to the `cbs` array, which could result in duplicate callbacks being executed.
