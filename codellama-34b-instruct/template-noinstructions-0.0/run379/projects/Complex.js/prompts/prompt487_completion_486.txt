  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() {
  return !(this.isNaN() || this.isFinite());
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not have the `isInfinite` method, so the test suite would not be able to test this method.
