  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `a` object instead of the `attr` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `b` object instead of the `attr` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `attr` object.

DONE.
