  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength` would be one less than the original code fragment, which could cause the algorithm to skip over the last operation in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength` would be one greater than the original code fragment, which could cause the algorithm to go beyond the last operation in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength` would be twice the original code fragment, which could cause the algorithm to go beyond the last operation in the iteration or potentially infinite loop the algorithm.

DONE.
