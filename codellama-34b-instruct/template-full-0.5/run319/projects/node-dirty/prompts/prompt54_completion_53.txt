  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.addEventListener
```
This would result in different behavior because `addEventListener` is a method that adds an event listener to an object, whereas `once` is a method that adds an event listener that is triggered only once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `on` is a method that adds an event listener to an object, whereas `once` is a method that adds an event listener that is triggered only once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is a method that triggers an event on an object, whereas `once` is a method that adds an event listener that is triggered only once.

DONE.
