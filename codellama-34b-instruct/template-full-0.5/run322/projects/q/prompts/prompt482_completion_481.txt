  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to always remove the first element from the `unhandledReasons` array, regardless of whether the promise was actually rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to always remove the last element from the `unhandledReasons` array, regardless of whether the promise was actually rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to always remove the element at index `1` from the `unhandledReasons` array, regardless of whether the promise was actually rejected.
