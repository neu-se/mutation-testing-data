  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next operation is an insert and if its length is less than or equal to the first left, but the replacement code checks if the next operation is an insert and if its length is less than the first left.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next operation is a delete and if its length is greater than or equal to the first left, but the replacement code checks if the next operation is a delete and if its length is greater than the first left.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' && thisIter.peekLength() ===
