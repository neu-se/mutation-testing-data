This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method is called directly, rather than being called on the `object` parameter. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Q` object itself, rather than on the `object` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on the `object` parameter, rather than on the `Q` object itself. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `object` parameter, rather than on the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on the `object` parameter, with the `op` and `args` parameters passed as arguments. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the
