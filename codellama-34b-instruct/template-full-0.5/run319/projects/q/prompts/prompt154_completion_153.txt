  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with the string "From previous event:\n" instead of the separator "From previous event:\n".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:\n" + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with the string "From previous event:\n\n" instead of the separator "From previous event:\n".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:\n" + "From previous event:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with the string "From previous event:\nFrom previous event:\n" instead of the separator "From previous event:\n".

DONE.
