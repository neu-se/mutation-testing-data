 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not store the promise in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, but instead an empty array, which would not allow the unhandled rejection to be processed correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not store any value in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would prevent the unhandled rejection from being processed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store an integer value in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the expected behavior and would cause an error when trying to process the unhandled rejection.

DONE.
