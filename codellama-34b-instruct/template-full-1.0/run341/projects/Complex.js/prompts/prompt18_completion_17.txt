  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(y)` is a different function than `Math.abs(y)`, and it would cause the parser to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `-sinh(y)` is a different function than `Math.abs(y)`, and it would cause the parser to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(y)` is a different function than `Math.abs(y)`, and it would cause the parser to behave differently.

DONE.
