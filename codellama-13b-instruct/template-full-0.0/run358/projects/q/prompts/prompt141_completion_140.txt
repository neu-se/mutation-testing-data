  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p` variable is now a string instead of an object, and the `source` property does not exist on strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p` variable is now a number instead of an object, and the `length` property does not exist on numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p` variable is now a number instead of an object, and the `length` property does not exist on numbers. Additionally, the `+ 1` operation would cause the `p` variable to be incremented by 1, which could have unintended consequences in the rest of the code.

DONE.
