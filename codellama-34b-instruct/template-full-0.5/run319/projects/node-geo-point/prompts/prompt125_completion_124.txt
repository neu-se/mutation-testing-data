  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the distance between two geographic points using the Haversine formula, while the replaced code fragment would return a hard-coded value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the distance between two geographic points using the Haversine formula, while the replaced code fragment would return the distance between the two points in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the distance between two geographic points using the Haversine formula, while the replaced code fragment would return the distance between the same point, effectively returning 0.

DONE.
