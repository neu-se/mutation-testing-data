  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `Q` is a module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves a promise, whereas `Q` is a module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects a promise, whereas `Q` is a module.

DONE.
