  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be increased by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently when handling the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decreased by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently when handling the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which could cause the program to behave differently when handling the operation.

DONE.
