  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
weird syntax
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a syntax error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a null value to the `parts` array, instead of the expected string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an empty string to the `parts` array, instead of the expected non-empty string.

DONE.
