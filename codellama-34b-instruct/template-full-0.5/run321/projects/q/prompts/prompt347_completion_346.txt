  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` could be a function that returns `null`, which would not be caught by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` could be a function that returns `undefined`, which would not be caught by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` could be a function that returns `undefined`, which would not be caught by the original code.

DONE.
