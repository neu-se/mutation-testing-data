 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's `this` value would be set to the global object instead of the expected `thisp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's `this` value would be set to an empty array instead of the expected `thisp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
