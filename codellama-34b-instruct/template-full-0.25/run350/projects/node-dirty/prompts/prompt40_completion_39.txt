  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for equality, while this new code fragment uses the `==` operator, which can lead to different results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for equality, while this new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which can lead to different results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for equality, while this new code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for inequality, which can lead to different results in certain cases.

DONE.
