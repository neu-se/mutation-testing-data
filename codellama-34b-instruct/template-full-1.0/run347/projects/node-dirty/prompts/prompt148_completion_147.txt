  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.pop()` will return the last element of the array, while `cbs` will return the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs[0]` will return the first element of the array, while `cbs` will return the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array and does not have a `length` property, while `cbs` is an array and has a `length` property.

DONE.
