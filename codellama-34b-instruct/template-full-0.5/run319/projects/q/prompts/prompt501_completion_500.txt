  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a way to represent the absence of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a way to represent the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the placeholder from `void 0` to the string "PLACEHOLDER".

DONE.
