  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the second string in the `strings` array to the first string, rather than the first string to the second string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the first string in the `strings` array to itself, rather than comparing two different strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the third string in the `strings` array to the first string, rather than comparing two different strings.

DONE.
