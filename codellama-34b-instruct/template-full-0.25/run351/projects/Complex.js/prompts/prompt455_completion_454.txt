  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isNaN` method, so if the original code fragment returned `true`, the mutated code fragment would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
