  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to `undefined`, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is provided or not. In the original code, the value is set to `undefined` only if `val` is `undefined`.

DONE.
