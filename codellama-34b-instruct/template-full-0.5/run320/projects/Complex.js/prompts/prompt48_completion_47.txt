  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] > 0 && !Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!Number.isFinite(a['arg'])` check would be performed before the `a['abs'] > 0` check, which could lead to a different result in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs']) || Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!Number.isFinite(a['abs'])` check would be performed before the `Number.isFinite(a['arg'])` check, which could lead to a different result in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] > 0 && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a['abs'] > 0` check would be performed before
