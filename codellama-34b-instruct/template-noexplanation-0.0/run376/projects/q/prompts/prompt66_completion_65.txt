  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "undefined" && MessageChannel.prototype.port1.onmessage === undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the `MessageChannel` object is defined and if its `port1` property has an `onmessage` property that is undefined. This change will cause the `requestTick` function to use `setTimeout` instead of `MessageChannel` when the `MessageChannel` object is not defined or when its `port1` property does not have an `onmessage` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "undefined" && MessageChannel.prototype.port1.onmessage === null
```
This code fragment checks if the `MessageChannel` object is defined and if its `port1` property has an `onmessage` property that is null. This change will cause the `requestTick` function to use `setTimeout` instead of `MessageChannel` when the `MessageChannel` object is not defined or when its `port1` property does not have an `onmessage` property
