  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const clothes = ['trouser', 'pant', 'pantie', 'clothe']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clothes` array would be redefined, potentially causing issues with the `addRule` function that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const clothes = ['trouser', 'pant', 'pantie', 'clothe', 'shoes']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clothes` array would have an additional element, potentially causing the `addRule` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const clothes = ['trouser', 'pant', 'pantie', 'clothe', 'shoes', 'socks']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clothes` array would have two additional elements, potentially causing the `addRule` function to behave differently.

DONE.
