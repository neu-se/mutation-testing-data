  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a function that calls a function with a given context and arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the resulting promise would not be able to be chained with other promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a function that registers callbacks to be invoked when a promise is resolved or rejected, but it does not return a promise, so the resulting promise would not be able to be chained with other promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a function that registers a callback to be invoked when a promise is rejected, but it does not return a promise, so the resulting promise would not be able to be chained with other promises.

DONE.
