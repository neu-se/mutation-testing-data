  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and therefore does not have a `toString` method. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `type` function is called on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a string and therefore cannot be used as a parameter for the `substr` function. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `addRule` function is called with `0` as the `match` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"test"` is not a regular expression and therefore cannot be used as a parameter for the `test` function. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `addRule` function is called with `"test"` as the `match` parameter.

DONE.
