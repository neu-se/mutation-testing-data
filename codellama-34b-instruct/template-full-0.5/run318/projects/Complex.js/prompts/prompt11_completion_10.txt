  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` and `Math.cosh` have different implementations and may produce different results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` and `Math.cosh` have different implementations and may produce different results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asinh` and `Math.cosh` have different implementations and may produce different results for certain input values.

DONE.
