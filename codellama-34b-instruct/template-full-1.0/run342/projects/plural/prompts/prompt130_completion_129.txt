  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < rules.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would be evaluated to false on the last iteration, and the loop would exit early without applying the final rule in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would be evaluated to true on the first iteration, and the loop would immediately exit without applying any rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would be evaluated to false on the first iteration, and the loop would immediately exit without applying any rules.

DONE.
