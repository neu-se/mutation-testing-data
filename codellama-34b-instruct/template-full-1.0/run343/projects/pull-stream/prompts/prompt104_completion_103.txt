  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.toArray()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not called, and `toArray` is not a valid method on the `drain` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.write(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not called, and `write` is not a valid method on the `drain` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not called, and `end` is not a valid method on the `drain` object.

DONE.
