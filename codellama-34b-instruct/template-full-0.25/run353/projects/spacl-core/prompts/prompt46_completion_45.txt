  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different from the one used in the original code fragment, and it may match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different from the one used in the original code fragment, and it may match a different set of strings. Additionally, the `[0]` index is added to the result, which may cause the code to behave differently if the regular expression matches more than one substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is
