  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the index is greater than 0, while the new code fragment is simply returning the character at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the index is greater than 0, while the new code fragment is incrementing the index value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the index is greater than 0, while the new code fragment is subtracting 1 from the base index value.

DONE.
