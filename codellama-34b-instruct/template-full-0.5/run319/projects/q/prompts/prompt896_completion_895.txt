  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that creates a new resolver function, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the deferred object with the provided value, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the deferred object with the provided reason, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

DONE.
