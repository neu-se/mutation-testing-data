 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the first element of the `progressListeners` array, instead of using the `progress` argument passed to the callback function. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `progressListeners` array has fewer than 2 elements or if the first element is not the intended listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
progressListeners.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes and returns the last element of the `progressListeners` array, instead of using the `progress` argument passed to the callback function. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `progressListeners` array has fewer than 2 elements or if the last element is not the intended listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of using the `progress` argument passed to the callback function. This
