  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
props.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.pop` would remove the last element from the `props` array, while `props.push` would add an element to the end of the array. If the `props` array is not empty, this would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice(-1)` would return the last element of the `props` array, while `props.push` would add an element to the end of the array. If the `props` array is not empty, this would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
props.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.length - 1` would return the length of the `props` array minus one, while `props.push` would add an element to
