  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling `fcall` with no arguments, while this replacement calls it with `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fcall(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling `fcall` with no arguments, while this replacement calls it with `undefined` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fcall(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling `fcall` with no arguments, while this replacement calls it with `promise` as an argument.

DONE.
