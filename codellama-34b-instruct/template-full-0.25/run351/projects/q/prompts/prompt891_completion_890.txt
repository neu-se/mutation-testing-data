  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is a reference to the `args` array, but `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is a reference to the `args` array, but `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is a reference to the `args` array, but `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
