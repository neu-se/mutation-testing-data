  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function that returns a value, but `s + 1` is a number, so it would change the type of the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, but `s.length` is a property of a string, so it would change the type of the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, but `s.toUpperCase()` is a function that returns a new string with all characters in uppercase, so it would change the type of the returned value and the behavior of the function.

DONE.
