  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
