  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, and the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have two elements, and the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a `null` element, and the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function would be called with the wrong type of argument.

DONE.
