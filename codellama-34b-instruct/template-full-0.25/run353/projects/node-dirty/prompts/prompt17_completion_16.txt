  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the key used to store the value in the `_data` map, potentially causing the `get` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the case of the key used to store the value in the `_data` map, potentially causing the `get` method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the key used to store the value in the `_data` map, potentially causing the `get` method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
