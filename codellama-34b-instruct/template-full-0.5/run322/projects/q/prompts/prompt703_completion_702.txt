  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would create a new array containing the arguments object, whereas `arguments` would refer to the original arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(promises))
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(promises)` would create a new array containing the `promises` array, whereas `arguments` would refer to the original arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(deferred))
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(deferred)` would create a new array containing the `deferred` object, whereas `arguments` would refer to the original arguments object.

DONE.
