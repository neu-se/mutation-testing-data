  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one iteration more than the original code, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, potentially causing the function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one iteration more than the original code, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
