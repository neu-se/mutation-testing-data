  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b ^ a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of raising the real part of the complex number to the power of the imaginary part, whereas the original code fragment returns the imaginary part.

DONE.
