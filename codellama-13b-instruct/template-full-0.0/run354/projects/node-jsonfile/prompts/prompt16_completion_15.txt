  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is asynchronous, while the new code fragment is synchronous. This could cause issues if the code is not designed to handle synchronous behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is asynchronous, while the new code fragment is synchronous. This could cause issues if the code is not designed to handle synchronous behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `universalify` module to wrap the `fs.readFile` function, while the new code fragment uses the `fs.readFileSync` function directly. This could cause issues if the `fs.readFileSync` function is not properly wrapped in the `universalify` module.

DONE.
