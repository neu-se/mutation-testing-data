  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `data` is truthy or falsy, while this code fragment checks if `data` is strictly equal to `undefined`. If `data` is any other value than `undefined`, the behavior of the two code fragments will differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof data !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `data` is truthy or falsy, while this code fragment checks if `data` is not of type `undefined` using `typeof` operator. If `data` is `undefined`, the behavior of the two code fragments will differ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `data` is truthy or falsy, while this code fragment checks if `data` is not `null`. If `data` is `
