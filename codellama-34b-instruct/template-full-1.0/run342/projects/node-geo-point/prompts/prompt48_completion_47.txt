  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2grad
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2grad` is a typo of `deg2rad`. `deg2grad` will not correctly convert degrees to radians, leading to unexpected results in the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` converts radians to degrees, which is the opposite of what the `calculateBearing` method expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ2 - φ1) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating the bearing between two points on a sphere is incorrect. The `φ2 - φ1` term calculates the difference in latitude, not the difference in longitude. Multiplying by 180/π converts the result to degrees.

DONE.
