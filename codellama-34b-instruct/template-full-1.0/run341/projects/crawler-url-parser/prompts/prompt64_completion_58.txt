  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedHost = psl.parse(ret.host);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `psl.parse` to parse the `host` property of the `ret` object, but in this option, we replaced it with the same function call, which would result in the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedHost = psl.parse(ret.host + '.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because we added '.com' to the end of the `host` property before parsing it. This would result in a different domain being parsed, and would therefore change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedHost = psl.parse(ret.host, {tlds:['com','org']});
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different set of top-level domains (TLDs) than the original code. This would result in
