  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `otherIter` array instead of the length of the current operation, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `thisIter` array instead of the length of the current operation, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the current operation, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

DONE.
