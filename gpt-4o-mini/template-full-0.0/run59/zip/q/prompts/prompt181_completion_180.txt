Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the space before the filename, which may cause the regex to fail to match certain stack trace formats that include a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes an additional capturing group for the column number, which is not handled in the original code, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the column number from the regex entirely, which may lead to incorrect extraction of the filename and line number from stack traces that include column information.

DONE.
