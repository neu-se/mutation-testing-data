 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
through
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite recursion, causing the process to crash due to exceeding the maximum call stack size. The `through` function is being used instead of the `once` function, which would cause the inner function to be called again and again, instead of only once as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `onEnd` callback from being called when the input stream ends. The original code calls `onEnd` with the `end` parameter, but replacing it with an empty function would cause this not to happen, potentially causing issues downstream if the consumers of this stream rely on the `onEnd` callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `op` function to be called with the `end` parameter instead of the `data
