 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would always pass an empty array as the second argument to `dispatch`, even when it was called with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would pass the value of `this` as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of the arguments passed to the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would always pass the number 1 as the second argument to `dispatch`, regardless of the arguments passed to the method.

DONE.
