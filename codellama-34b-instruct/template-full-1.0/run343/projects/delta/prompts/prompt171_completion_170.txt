  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest number among its arguments, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest number among its arguments. If `otherIter.peekLength()` is greater than `length`, this would result in `otherIter.peekLength()` being used as the minimum value, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `length + 1` would always be greater than `otherIter.peekLength()`, causing the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is the JavaScript way of writing `undefined`, and it would cause the `while` loop to iterate infinitely if `otherIter.
