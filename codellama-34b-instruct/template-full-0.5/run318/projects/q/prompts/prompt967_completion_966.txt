  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `nbind` function, rather than all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the number of arguments as the first argument to the `nbind` function, rather than the arguments themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument to the `nbind` function, rather than all the arguments.

DONE.
