  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would be set to `true` immediately, causing the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which would terminate the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would be set to `false` immediately, causing the `read` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which would not terminate the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would be set to `null` immediately, causing the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would not terminate the stream.

DONE.
