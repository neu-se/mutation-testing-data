Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.substring(0, val.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character from the string instead of removing trailing zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.split('.').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the decimal point and any digits after it, instead of removing trailing zeros after a decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.replace(/\.0+$/, '0')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces trailing zeros after a decimal point with a single '0', instead of removing them entirely.

DONE.
