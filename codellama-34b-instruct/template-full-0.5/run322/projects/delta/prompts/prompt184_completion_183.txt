  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the type of `otherOp.retain` instead of `thisOp.retain`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if `thisOp.retain` is an object instead of a number, which could lead to incorrect results in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if `otherOp.retain` is an object instead of a number, which could lead to incorrect results in the `compose` method.

DONE.
