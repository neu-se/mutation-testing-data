  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would return a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` would return a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `resolve` would return a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` would notify observers of the promise, whereas `resolve` would return a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
