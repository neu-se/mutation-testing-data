  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would create a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` would create a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a deferred promise, whereas `Q.resolve` would create a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` would create a promise that resolves when all promises in an array have resolved, whereas `Q.resolve` would create a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
