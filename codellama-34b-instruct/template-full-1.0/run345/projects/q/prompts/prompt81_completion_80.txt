  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextTick` is a function, and `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

DONE.
