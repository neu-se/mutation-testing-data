  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be used as the separator instead of the dollar sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a space would be used as the separator instead of the dollar sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because a backslash would be used as the separator instead of the dollar sign.

DONE.
