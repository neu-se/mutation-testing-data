 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject).done();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.done()` method is called, which is not present in the original code. The `.done()` method is used to indicate that no further operations will be chained to the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.fail()` method is replaced with an additional argument to `.fapply()`. The `.fapply()` method does not take a second argument, so this would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.apply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
