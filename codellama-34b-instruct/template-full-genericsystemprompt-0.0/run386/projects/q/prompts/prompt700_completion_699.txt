  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array and returns it, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays.

DONE.
