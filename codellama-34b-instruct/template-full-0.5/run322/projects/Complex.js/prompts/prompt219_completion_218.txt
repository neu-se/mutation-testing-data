  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the value of `c` to `b`, which could change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value of `b` by `c`, which could change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the value of `b` by `c`, which could change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

DONE.
