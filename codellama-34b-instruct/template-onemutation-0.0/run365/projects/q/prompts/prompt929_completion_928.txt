  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `args` array is used to store arguments passed to a function, and the `unshift` method is used to add the `thisp` argument to the beginning of the array. If `push` were used instead, the `thisp` argument would be added to the end of the array, which would likely cause the function to behave incorrectly.
