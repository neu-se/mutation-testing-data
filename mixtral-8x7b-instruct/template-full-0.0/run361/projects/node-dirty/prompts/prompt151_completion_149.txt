 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in the `this._writeStream.write()` method would not receive an error object, which could cause the error handling code to not execute as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in the `this._writeStream.write()` method would receive an empty object instead of an error object, which could cause the error handling code to not execute as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in the `this._writeStream.write()` method would receive a function instead of an error object, which could cause the error handling code to not execute as intended.

DONE.
