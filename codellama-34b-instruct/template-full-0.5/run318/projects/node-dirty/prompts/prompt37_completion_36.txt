  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would now be iterating over the `_queue` Map instead of the `_data` Map, which could cause the `fn` function to be called with different arguments and potentially produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would now be iterating over the entries of the `_data` Map instead of the Map itself, which could cause the `fn` function to be called with different arguments and potentially produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would now be iterating over the keys of the `_data` Map instead of the Map itself, which could cause the `fn` function to be called with different arguments and potentially produce different results.

DONE.
