  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `map` function, while the new code fragment `abortCb` is a callback function that is called with the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `map` function, while the new code fragment `null` is a null value that is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `map` function, while the new code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value that is not a function and will not be called.

DONE.
