```
fulfilled
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled, not when it is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled, not when it is rejected.
