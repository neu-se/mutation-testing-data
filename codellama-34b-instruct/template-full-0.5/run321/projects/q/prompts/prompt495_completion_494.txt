  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(rejection, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function is called with the `rejection` and `reason` arguments in the opposite order than in the original code, which could cause the unhandled rejection to be incorrectly tracked or untracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(reason, rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function is called with the `reason` and `rejection` arguments in the opposite order than in the original code, which could cause the unhandled rejection to be incorrectly tracked or untracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(null, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function is called with `null` as the `rejection` argument, which could cause the unhandled rejection to be incorrectly tracked
