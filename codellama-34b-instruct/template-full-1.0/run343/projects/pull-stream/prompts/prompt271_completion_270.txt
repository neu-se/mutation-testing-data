  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, even if the input stream is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, even if the input stream is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `values` array, even if the input stream is empty.

DONE.
