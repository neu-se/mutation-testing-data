  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (chunk.lastIndexOf('}') ===-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the last index of `}` is -1 instead of checking if the index of `\n` is -1. This would cause the parsing logic to fail if there is no `}` in the chunk, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (chunk.lastIndexOf('{') ===-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the last index of `{` is -1 instead of checking if the index of `\n` is -1. This would cause the parsing logic to fail if there is no `{` in the chunk, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (chunk.lastIndexOf('}') === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the last index
