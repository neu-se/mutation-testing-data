  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `d` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `d` is not equal to 0, even if `a` and `b` are both equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 || b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if either `a` or `b` is not equal to 0, even if `d` is equal to 0.
