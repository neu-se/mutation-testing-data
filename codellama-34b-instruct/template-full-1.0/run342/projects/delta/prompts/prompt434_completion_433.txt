  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is using the `Op.length` function to get the length of the current Op, and if `null` is passed to the function, it will return `Infinity`, which means the method will return `Infinity` instead of the actual length of the Op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is using the `Op.length` function to get the length of the current Op, and if `undefined` is passed to the function, it will return `NaN`, which means the method will return `NaN` instead of the actual length of the Op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is using the `Op.length` function to get the length of the current Op, and if `0` is passed to the
