  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `exception` object is not necessarily the same as the `exception` object itself, which is what the original code fragment would return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `exception` object is not necessarily the same as the `exception` object itself, which is what the original code fragment would return.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `exception` object is not necessarily the same as the `exception` object itself, which is what the original code fragment would return.

DONE.
