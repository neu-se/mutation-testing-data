 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would no longer use the provided `reviver` function, potentially causing incorrect parsing of JSON strings with special handling requirements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the `reviver` argument, which would not have any effect on JSON parsing. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the JSON string contains special cases that require custom handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.reviver || JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because, if the `options` object does not have a `reviver` property, the default `JSON.parse` function would be used instead of `undefined`. This could lead to incorrect parsing of JSON strings if the code relies on the `reviver` function to handle special cases.

DONE.
