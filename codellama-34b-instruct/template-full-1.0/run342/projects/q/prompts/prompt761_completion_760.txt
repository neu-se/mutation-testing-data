  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` has a different value than `promises`, which is an array containing values or promises for values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` has a different value than `promises`, which is an array containing values or promises for values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` has a different value than `promises`, which is an array containing values or promises for values.

DONE.
