  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `reason` is likely an object or a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `reason` is likely an object or a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"error"` is a string, and `reason` is likely an object or a function.

DONE.
