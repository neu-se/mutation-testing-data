Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it will treat any non-truthy value (including `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, etc.) as a valid promise, leading to incorrect handling of non-promise values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof promise === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will incorrectly identify any object (including plain objects and arrays) as a promise, which may not be the intended behavior since not all objects are promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only consider arrays as valid promises, ignoring other promise-like objects, which could lead to unexpected results when handling promises.

DONE.
