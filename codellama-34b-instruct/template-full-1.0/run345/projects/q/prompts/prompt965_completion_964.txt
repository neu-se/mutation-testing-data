  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.prototype.denodeify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `denodeify` method on the `Q` prototype, which is different from the `Q.prototype.nbind` method that is called in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.denodeify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `denodeify` method on the `Object` prototype, which is different from the `Q.prototype.nbind` method that is called in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype.denodeify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `denodeify` method on the `Function` prototype, which is different from the `Q.prototype.nbind` method that is called in the original code fragment.

DONE.
