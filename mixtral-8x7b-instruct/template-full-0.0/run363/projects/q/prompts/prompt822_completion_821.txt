 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as an argument, and null is not a promise. This would cause the `then` method in the `done` function to throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as an argument, and `Q.resolve(2)` is a promise that is immediately fulfilled with the value 2. This would cause the `then` method in the `done` function to be called immediately with the value 2, rather than waiting for the original promise to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Failed'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as an argument, and `Q.reject(new Error('Failed'))` is a promise that is
