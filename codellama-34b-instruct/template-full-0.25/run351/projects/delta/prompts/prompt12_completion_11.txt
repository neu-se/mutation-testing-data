  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a[key]` is not `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `a[key]` is not `null`. This change could cause the `compose` function to produce different results if `a[key]` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b[key]` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `b[key]` is not `undefined`. This change could cause the `compose` function to produce different results if `b[key]` is not `undefined`.
