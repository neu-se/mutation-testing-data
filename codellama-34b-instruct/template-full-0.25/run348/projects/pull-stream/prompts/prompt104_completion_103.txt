  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with the arguments `(null, done)`, which is not the same as the original code where `drain` is called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with the arguments `(done, null)`, which is not the same as the original code where `drain` is called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with the argument `done`, which is not the same as the original code where `drain` is called with no arguments.

DONE.
