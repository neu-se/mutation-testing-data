  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last operation in the iteration, potentially causing the `diff` function to miss important differences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last operation in the other delta, potentially causing the `diff` function to miss important differences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra operation in the iteration, potentially causing the `diff` function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
