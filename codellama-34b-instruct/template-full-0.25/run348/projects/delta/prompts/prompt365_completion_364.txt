  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        (priority || otherIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and if it's not, it continues to the next iteration. However, this modified code fragment would always continue to the next iteration, even if the next type is 'insert', which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        (priority || otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and if it's not, it continues to the next iteration. However, this modified code fragment would always continue to the next iteration, even if the next type is 'delete', which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
