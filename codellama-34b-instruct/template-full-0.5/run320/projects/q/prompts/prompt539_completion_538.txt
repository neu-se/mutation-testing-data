  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved, whereas `args` is an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as any of the promises in the array have resolved or rejected, whereas `args` is an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.any(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.any` returns a promise that resolves with the first value in the array that is not a promise, whereas `args` is an array of values.

DONE.
