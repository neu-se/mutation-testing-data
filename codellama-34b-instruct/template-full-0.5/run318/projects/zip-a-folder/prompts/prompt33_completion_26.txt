  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => { throw new Error('Custom error message'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message is thrown instead of the original error message, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', (err) => { console.log(err); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is logged to the console instead of being handled by the `reject` function, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
