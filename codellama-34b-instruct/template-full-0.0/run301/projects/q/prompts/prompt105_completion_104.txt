  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `reduce` function to skip every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the `reduce` function to skip every other element in the array in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `reduce` function to skip every other element in the array and also cause the function to process some elements twice.

DONE.
