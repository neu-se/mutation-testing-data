  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `1` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `"foo"` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `null` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
