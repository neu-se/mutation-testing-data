  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code, causing the `copy[key] = attributes[key];` line to be executed even if the `attributes[key]` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes[key]` is undefined instead of null, which would cause the `copy[key] = attributes[key];` line to be executed even if the `attributes[key]` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined && attributes[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes[key]` is not undefined and not null, which would cause the `copy[key] = attributes[key];` line to be executed even if the `attributes[key]` is not undefined and not null.
