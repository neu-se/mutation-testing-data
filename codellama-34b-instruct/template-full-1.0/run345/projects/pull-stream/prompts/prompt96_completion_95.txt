  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, and the callback function may not expect this.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is not `null`, which might cause the callback function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is no longer an array, and the callback function may not be able to handle it correctly.

DONE.
