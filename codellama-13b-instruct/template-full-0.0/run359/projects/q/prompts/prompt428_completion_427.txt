  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `object` in the original code, but it is defined on the `object` in the buggy code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `object` in the original code, but it is defined on the `object` in the buggy code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not defined on the `object` in the original code, but it is defined on the `object` in the buggy code fragment.

DONE.
