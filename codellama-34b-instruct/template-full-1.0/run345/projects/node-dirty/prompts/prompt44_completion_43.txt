  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update()` is a method provided by the `Dirty` class, while `set()` is a method provided by the `EventEmitter` class. Replacing `this.set()` with `this.update()` would result in a different method being called, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._set
```
This would result in different behavior because `_set` is a private method provided by the `Dirty` class, while `set()` is a public method. Replacing `this.set()` with `this._set()` would bypass the public method and call the private one directly, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` returns a new function that is bound to the provided context (in this case, `this`).
