  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`, while this new code fragment would reject the promise with an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`, while this new code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `42`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("something happened");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not notify the promise with any value, while this new code fragment would notify the promise with the value `"something happened"`.

DONE.
