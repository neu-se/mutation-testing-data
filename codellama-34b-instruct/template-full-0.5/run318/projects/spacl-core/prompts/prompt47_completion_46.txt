  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.*` would match any number of characters, including none, whereas the original `.+` would match at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{2,}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.{2,}` would match at least 2 characters, whereas the original `.+` would match at least one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.?` would match at most one character, whereas the original `.+` would match at least one character.

DONE.
