  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator used in the `filterStackString` function to a tab character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator used in the `filterStackString` function to a space character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"_"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator used in the `filterStackString` function to an underscore character instead of a newline character.

DONE.
