  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `2`, but it is still a valid operand for the addition operator. Therefore, the resulting expression would still be a valid JavaScript expression, but it would not have the same value as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid operand for the addition operator, so the code would throw a `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object, not a number, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
