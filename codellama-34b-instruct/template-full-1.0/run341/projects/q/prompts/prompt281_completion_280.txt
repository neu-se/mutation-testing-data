  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `undefined`, rather than resolved with the value of `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `null`, rather than resolved with the value of `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the string "placeholder", rather than the value of `arguments`.

DONE.
