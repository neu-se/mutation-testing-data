  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index+1], index
```
This would result in different behavior because the index used to access the array element is off by one, causing the wrong element to be used in the reduction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index used to access the array element is off by one, causing the wrong element to be used in the reduction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index+1], index+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index used to access the array element is off by one, causing the wrong element to be used in the reduction.
