  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstOther = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when trying to access the `retain` property of `firstOther`, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstOther = { retain: null };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, since `typeof firstOther.retain` is not `'number'` but `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstOther = { retain: undefined };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, since `typeof firstOther.retain` is not `'number'` but `undefined`.

DONE.
