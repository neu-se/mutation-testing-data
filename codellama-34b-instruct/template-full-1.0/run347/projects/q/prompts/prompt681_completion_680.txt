  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```string standardizeSurrogates(e) {
  return e.code > 0xD7FF
   ? -1
   : e.code > 0xFDCF
    ? -1
    : e.code > 0x10FC
     ? -1
     : e.code > 681
      ? -1
      : e.code > 0xdf)
           ? 0x20
           : e.code > 0xb7
            ? 0x20
            : -1;
}
```

This would result in different behavior because the `standardizeSurrogates` function uses a different algorithm to determine the replacement character for surrogate pairs. The new function uses a simpler and less efficient algorithm, but it is sufficient for the purpose of demonstrating the concept of mutations and their effects on the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```int getSurrogateCount(const string& str) {
