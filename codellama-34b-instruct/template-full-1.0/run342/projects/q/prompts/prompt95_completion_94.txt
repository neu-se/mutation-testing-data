  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would not increment `index` before the comparison, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would include `index` in the comparison, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would subtract `index` from `length`, leading to a different result.

DONE.
