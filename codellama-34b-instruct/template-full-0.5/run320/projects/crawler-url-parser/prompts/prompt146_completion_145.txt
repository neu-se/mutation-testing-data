  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different part of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would not replace the matched part of the URL with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would replace the matched part of the URL with the string "default", which is not the same as the original behavior.

DONE.
