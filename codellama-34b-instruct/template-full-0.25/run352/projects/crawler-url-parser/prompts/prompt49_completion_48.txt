  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` expects a string as its first argument, but `parsedBaseUrl` is already a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl.href, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedBaseUrl.href` is a string, but `parsedUrl` is a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` is a string, but `parsedBaseUrl` is a URL object.

DONE.
