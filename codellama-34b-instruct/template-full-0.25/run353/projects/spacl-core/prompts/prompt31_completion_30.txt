  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character is not a valid escape character in JavaScript, and it would cause the regular expression to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the forward slash character is not a valid escape character in JavaScript, and it would cause the regular expression to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the double backslash character is a valid escape character in JavaScript, and it would cause the regular expression to match a literal backslash character.

DONE.
