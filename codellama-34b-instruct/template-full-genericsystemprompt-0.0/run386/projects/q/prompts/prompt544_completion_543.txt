  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check the type of the `StopIteration` object, while the replacement code fragment checks for strict equality with the string `"undefined"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used to check for strict inequality with the string `"undefined"`, while the replacement code fragment checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check the type of the `StopIteration` object, while the replacement code fragment checks for strict inequality with the string `"undefined"`.

DONE.
