  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.push(null)` would add `null` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, instead of the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function that was originally passed. This would cause the `setTimeout` function to be called with a `null` callback, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.push(undefined)` would add `undefined` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, instead of the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function that was originally passed. This would cause the `setTimeout` function to be called with a `undefined` callback, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.
