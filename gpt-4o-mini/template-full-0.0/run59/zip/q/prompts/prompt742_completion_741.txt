Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` will immediately fulfill the promise with the given value, rather than waiting for the promise to settle, which could lead to premature resolution of the `any` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will immediately reject the promise with the given reason, which would cause the `any` function to reject immediately instead of waiting for any of the promises to fulfill.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` will not handle the promise at all, effectively ignoring it and causing the `any` function to not wait for the promise to settle, leading to incorrect behavior in promise resolution.

DONE.
