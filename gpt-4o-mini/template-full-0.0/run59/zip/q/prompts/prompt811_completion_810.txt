Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback = Q.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback to always return a rejected promise, regardless of the original promise's resolution, which would prevent the successful resolution of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback = Q.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback to always return a fulfilled promise, which would ignore any errors that occurred in the original promise, potentially leading to unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the callback to null would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call `callback.fcall()`, breaking the promise chain and leading to an uncaught exception.

DONE.
