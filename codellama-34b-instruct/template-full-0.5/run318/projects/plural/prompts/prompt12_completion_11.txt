  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/gi, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed from the regular expression, which makes it case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
