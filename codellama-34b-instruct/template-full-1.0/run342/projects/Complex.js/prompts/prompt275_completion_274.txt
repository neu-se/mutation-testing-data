  The PLACEHOLDER in the `sin` method can be replaced with:

Option 1:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` have different ranges of values.

Option 2:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than `Math.sin(a*b)`.

Option 3:
```
Math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a**2 + b**2` is the square of the length of the vector from the origin to the point (a,b), while `Math.sin(a*b)` is the sine of the angle between the vector and the x-axis.

DONE.
