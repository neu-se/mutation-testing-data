  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `null` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `0` would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
