  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `isNodeJS` variable is true, while this new code fragment would always throw an error regardless of the value of `isNodeJS`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `flush` function immediately, while this new code fragment would call it after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `setTimeout` to schedule the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds, while this new code fragment uses `setImmediate` to schedule the `flush` function to be called as soon as possible after the current execution context.

DONE.
