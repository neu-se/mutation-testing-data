  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator without checking if the next operation is an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the other iterator without checking if the next operation is an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the next operation without checking if it is an insert.

DONE.
