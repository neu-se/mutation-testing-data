 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to move on to the next stream instead of processing the current chunk of data. This could lead to data loss or incorrect processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `nextChunk` function with an empty function, effectively skipping the processing of the current chunk of data. This could lead to data loss or incorrect processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `_read` variable to `null`, causing the function to move on to the next stream instead of processing the current chunk of data. This could lead to data loss or incorrect processing.

DONE.
