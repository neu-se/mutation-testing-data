  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `all()` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of fulfillment values or rejection reasons when the iterable passed to it is empty. If `args` is replaced with `null`, `all()` would return a promise that is immediately fulfilled with a single value of `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"args"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string "args" as the first argument to `all()`, which would cause it to return a promise that is fulfilled with an array of fulfillment values or rejection reasons when the iterable passed to it contains only strings. This would not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an integer value of 5 as the first argument to `all()`, which would cause it to return a promise that is immediately
