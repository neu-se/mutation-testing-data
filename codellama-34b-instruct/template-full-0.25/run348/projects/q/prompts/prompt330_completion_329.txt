  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object as its argument, and passing `null` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the intended error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object as its argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the intended error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("some other error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object as its argument, and passing a different error object would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error than the intended one.

DONE.
