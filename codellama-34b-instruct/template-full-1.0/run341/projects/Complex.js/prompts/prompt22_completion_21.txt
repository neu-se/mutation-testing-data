  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because addition associative z should be commutative, but it affects the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the operators in the expression no longer have the same order of operations, and the result would change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b * Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` would introduce a sine function into the equation, which would change the nature of the calculation.

DONE.
