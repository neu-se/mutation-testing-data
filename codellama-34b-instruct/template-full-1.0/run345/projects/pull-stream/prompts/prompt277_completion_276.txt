  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are three possible code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream` is not defined in the scope of the function, and would therefore throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null.
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a value of `null` to `_read`, which is not the same as the original code that assigned a function to `_read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = function() {}.
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a function that does nothing to `_read`, which is not the same as the original code that assigned a function that performs the `read` operation.

DONE.
