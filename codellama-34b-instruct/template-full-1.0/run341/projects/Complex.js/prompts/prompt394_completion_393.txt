  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is now negated, which would change the result of the `Math.cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is now added to 1, which would change the result of the `Math.cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is now multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the `Math.cos` function.

DONE.
