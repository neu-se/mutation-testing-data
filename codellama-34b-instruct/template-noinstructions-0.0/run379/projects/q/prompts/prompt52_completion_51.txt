  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    process.nextTick(flush);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would be called with a different argument, which could affect the behavior of the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setTimeout(flush, 0);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would be called with a different argument, which could affect the behavior of the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setImmediate(flush);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would be called with a different argument, which could affect the behavior of the `flush` function.

DONE.
