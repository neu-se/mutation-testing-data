  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== 0` is a necessary condition for evaluating the `fill` function, and the mutated code would always evaluate to `a / 0`, which would result in a division by zero exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different variables, and the mutated code would always evaluate to `a / 0`, which would result in a division by zero exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that is unrelated to the variables `a` and `b`, and the mutated code would always evaluate to `a / 0`, which would result in a division by zero exception.
