  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.reverse()` would mutate the array, resulting in a different order of the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.slice(0, 1)` would return a new array containing only the first element of `this.rules`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.slice(1)` would return a new array containing only the elements of `this.rules` after the first element.

DONE.
