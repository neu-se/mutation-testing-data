  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would not be called, and the `next` function would not be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would not be called, and the `next` function would not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with a truthy value, and the `next` function would be defined.

DONE.
