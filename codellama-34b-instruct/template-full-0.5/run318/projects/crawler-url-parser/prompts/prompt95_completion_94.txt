  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol + '://' + baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would construct a new URL string using the `protocol` and `host` properties of the `baseUrl` object, which may not match the original `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the `baseUrlStr` argument, which may cause the function to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

DONE.
