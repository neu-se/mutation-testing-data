  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to `setImmediate`, rather than the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to `setImmediate`, rather than the `flush` function.

DONE.
