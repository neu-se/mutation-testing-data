  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([1, 2, 3])` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by the elements `1`, `2`, and `3`, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` multiplied by `2`, whereas `args` would return the
