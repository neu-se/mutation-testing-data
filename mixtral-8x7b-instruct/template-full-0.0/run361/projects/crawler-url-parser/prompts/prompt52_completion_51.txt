 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'..'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve relative paths with two parent directory levels instead of using the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'javascript:void(0)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a dummy JavaScript URL instead of the base URL, causing issues with relative URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.protocol + '://' + parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the protocol and host, ignoring the path, query parameters, and fragments, which could lead to incorrect URL resolution.

DONE.
