  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element at a specific index in an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging the original array with the new element, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
