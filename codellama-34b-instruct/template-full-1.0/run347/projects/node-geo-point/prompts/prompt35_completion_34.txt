  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) + 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `point2Rad` is now 10 degrees larger than the original value, which would change the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) - 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `point2Rad` is now 10 degrees smaller than the original value, which would also change the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `point2Rad` is now based on the `longitude` value of `point2`, but the original code fragment used the `latitude` value.
