  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional `then` method to the promise chain, which would cause the promise to resolve with the value returned by the callback function, rather than the original value.

DONE.
