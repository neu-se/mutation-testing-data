 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow at least one operator to be present before checking if the stack is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require at least one operator to be present before checking if the stack is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if there are any remaining tokens instead of checking if the stack is empty.

DONE.
