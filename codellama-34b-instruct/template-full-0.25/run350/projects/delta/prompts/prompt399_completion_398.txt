  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `thisData` and `otherData` are not equal, regardless of their types or contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.constructor !== otherData.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `thisData` and `otherData` are not of the same type, regardless of their contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(thisData).length !== Object.keys(otherData).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `thisData` and `otherData` have a different number of properties, regardless of their contents.

DONE.
