  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of `Object.prototype`, and using `call` or `apply` to invoke it on a different object would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of `Object.prototype`, and using it on a different object would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of `Object.prototype`, and using `call` or `apply` to invoke it on a different object would return a different result.

DONE.
