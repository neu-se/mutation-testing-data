  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `become` function to be called even if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, and `resolvedPromise` is a promise object that will never be strictly equal to `true`. The `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, and the `become` function would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled()` method checks if the promise has been resolved or rejected, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if the promise has been resolved
