  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because this code will add `http://` to the beginning of the string only if it does not already start with `//`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!\w+:)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because this code will add `http://` to the beginning of the string only if it does not already start with a protocol (e.g. `http://`, `https://`, etc.).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!.*[A-Za-z])/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because this code will add `http://` to the beginning of the string only if it does not contain any alphabetic characters.

DONE.
