  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'sparrow', 'sparrows'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word ('sparrows' instead of 'gooses') would not be a recognized plural form, leading to a failure of the test case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses', 'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word ('gooses' instead of 'goose') would be a recognized plural form, leading to a failure of the test case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word ('geese' instead of 'goose') would be a recognized plural form, leading to a failure of the test case.

DONE.
