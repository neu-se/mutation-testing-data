  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the context of the call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument, which would change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to `apply`, which would change the context of the call.

DONE.
