  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added, which would cause the `post` method to receive more arguments than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` and `name` arguments are swapped, which would cause the `post` method to receive the arguments in a different order than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` argument is omitted, which would cause the `post` method to receive fewer arguments than expected.

DONE.
