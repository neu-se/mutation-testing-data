  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect().state` would always be "fulfilled" since the promise is resolved, and the `when` function would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect().state` would always be "fulfilled" since the promise is resolved, and the `when` function would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect().state` would always be "fulfilled" since the promise is resolved, and the `when` function would never be called.

DONE.
