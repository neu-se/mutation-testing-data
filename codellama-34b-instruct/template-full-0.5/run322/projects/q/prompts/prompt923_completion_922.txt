  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is not a valid method of the `Q` function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a valid method of the `Q` function, but it expects an array of arguments, rather than a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfcall(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is a valid method of the `Q` function, but it expects a single argument, rather than an array of arguments.

DONE.
