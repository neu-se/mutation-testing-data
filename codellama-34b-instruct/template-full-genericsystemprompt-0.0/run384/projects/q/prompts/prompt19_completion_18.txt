  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with an incorrect argument, leading to a different stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with an incorrect argument, leading to a different stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with an incorrect argument, leading to a different stack trace.

DONE.
