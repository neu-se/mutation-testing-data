  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array, so the resulting array would contain the elements of both `games` and `illnesses`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array from the specified start index to the specified end index, so the resulting array would contain all the elements of `games` except the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.filter(function(word) { return word.length > 5; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array that satisfy the specified condition, so the resulting array would contain only the elements of `
