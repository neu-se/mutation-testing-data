  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the given exception, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled(value)` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise with the given value, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise with the given value.

DONE.
