  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array with all elements except the first one, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated without the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop().join
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes and returns the last element of the array, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated without the last element.

DONE.
