  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + length, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a slice that starts at the wrong index, potentially returning the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a slice that is one index too long, potentially returning more data than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + length - 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a slice that ends at the wrong index, potentially returning less data than intended.

DONE.
