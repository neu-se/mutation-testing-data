  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the buffer by newlines, but this replacement would split it by spaces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the buffer by newlines, but this replacement would split it by carriage return and newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the buffer by newlines, but this replacement would split it by the literal string '\n' rather than the newline character.

DONE.
