  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.cancel()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be canceled, rather than resolved or rejected.

DONE.
