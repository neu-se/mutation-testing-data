  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method is called with the `src` argument set to `false`, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method is called with the `src` argument set to `true`, which would cause the method to succeed but archive the wrong directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, 'wrong_directory');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method is called with the `src` argument set to a string that does not match the name of any directory, which would cause the method to fail.

DONE.
