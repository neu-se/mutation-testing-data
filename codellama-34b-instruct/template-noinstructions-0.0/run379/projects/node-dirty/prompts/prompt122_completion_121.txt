  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'drain'` event when the write stream is drained, but the replaced code would emit the `'error'` event instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'drain'` event when the write stream is drained, but the replaced code would emit the `'close'` event instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'drain'` event when the write stream is drained, but the replaced code would emit the `'end'` event instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
