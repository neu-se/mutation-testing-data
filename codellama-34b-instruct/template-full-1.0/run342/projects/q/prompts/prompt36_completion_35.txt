  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because !isNodeJS will always be true in a browser environment, while isNodeJS may be true or false depending on the environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.browser
```
This would result in different behavior because process.browser is a boolean property that indicates whether the code is running in a browser or not. If process.browser is true, the code will behave differently than if it were running in node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because if the code is running in a browser, window will be defined, while if it is running in node.js, window will be undefined.

DONE.
