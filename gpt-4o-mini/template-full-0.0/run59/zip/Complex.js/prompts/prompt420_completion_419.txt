Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for zero values explicitly instead of using the `isZero()` method, which may have additional logic or checks that are not accounted for in this simple comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== 0 || this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the real or imaginary part is non-zero, which would incorrectly indicate that the complex number is not zero when it actually could be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is infinite instead of checking if it is zero, leading to a completely different condition being evaluated.

DONE.
