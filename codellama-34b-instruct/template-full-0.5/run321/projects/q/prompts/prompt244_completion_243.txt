  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf();
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` is a different method than `inspect`, and it may return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch();
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is a different method than `inspect`, and it may perform a different action.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source;
```
This would result in different behavior because `source` is a different property than `inspect`, and it may have a different value.

DONE.
