  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, null, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would no longer have access to the correct `resolve` function and argument list, leading to unexpected behavior when the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would no longer have access to the correct `op` and `args` arguments, leading to unexpected behavior when the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, "when", [deferred.reject]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would no longer have access to the correct `deferred.reject` function, leading to unexpected behavior when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
