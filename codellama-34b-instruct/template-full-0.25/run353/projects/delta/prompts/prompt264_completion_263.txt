  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is not defined on the `otherOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined on the `otherOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is not defined on the `otherOp` object.

DONE.
