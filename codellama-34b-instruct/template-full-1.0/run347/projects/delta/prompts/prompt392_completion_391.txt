  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a method that returns the length of a string, while `length()` is a method that returns the length of a delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.length()` is a method that returns the length of a delta, while `length` is a variable that represents the length of a delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length()` is a method that returns the length of a delta, while `length` is a variable that represents the length of a delta.

DONE.
