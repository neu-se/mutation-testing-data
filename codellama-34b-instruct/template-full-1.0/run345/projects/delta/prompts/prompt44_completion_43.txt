  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' || a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `!==` to check for nullity, while this replacement uses `!=` to check for nullity. This means that the code will behave differently when `a` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' || typeof a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `!==` to check for nullity, while this replacement uses `!=` to check for nullity. This means that the code will behave differently when `a` is null or undefined.
