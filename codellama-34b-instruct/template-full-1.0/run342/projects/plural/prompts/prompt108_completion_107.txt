  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "s" to the end of the word, while the modified code fragment removes the last character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "s" to the end of the word, while the modified code fragment removes the last two characters instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace("y", "ies") }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "s" to the end of the word, while the modified code fragment replaces the "y" with "ies".

DONE.
