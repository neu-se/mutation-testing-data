 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to the `when` function would be `null` instead of `result.value`. This could cause issues if the `when` function doesn't handle `null` values correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
result.value, function() { callback; }, errback
