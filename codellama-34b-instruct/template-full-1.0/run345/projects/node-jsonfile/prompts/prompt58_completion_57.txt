  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` would include the string `'foo'` in the output, which would not be the case with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOF
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` would not include the string `EOF` in the output, which would not be the case with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` would include a string representation of `undefined` in the output, which would not be the case with the original code.

DONE.
