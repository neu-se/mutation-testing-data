  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as an HTTPS URL instead of an HTTP URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as an HTTP URL with the "www." subdomain instead of an HTTP URL without a subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as an HTTP URL with the "localhost" domain instead of an HTTP URL with the domain from the base URL.

DONE.
