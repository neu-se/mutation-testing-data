  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the second argument to `predicate` would be an empty object, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, null, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the second argument to `predicate` would be `null`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, undefined, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the second argument to `predicate` would be `undefined`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
