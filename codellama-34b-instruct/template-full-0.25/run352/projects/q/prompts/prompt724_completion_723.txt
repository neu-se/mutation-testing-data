  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, whereas `promise` returns the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function if the original promise is rejected, whereas `promise` returns the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.finally` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function regardless of whether the original promise is fulfilled or rejected, whereas `promise` returns the original promise.

DONE.
