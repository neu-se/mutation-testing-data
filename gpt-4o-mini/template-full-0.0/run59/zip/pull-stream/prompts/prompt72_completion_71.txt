Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `data` would cause the operation `op` to evaluate to `false`, potentially leading to premature termination of the reading process and not processing the actual data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `data` would also cause the operation `op` to evaluate to `false`, similar to the first option, which could disrupt the expected flow of data processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` instead of `data` would likely cause the operation `op` to evaluate to `false`, leading to the same issue of not processing the actual data and potentially causing the stream to terminate incorrectly.

DONE.
