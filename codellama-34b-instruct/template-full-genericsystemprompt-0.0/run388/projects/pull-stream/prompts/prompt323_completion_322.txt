  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with the `abort` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with the `abort` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function without any arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
