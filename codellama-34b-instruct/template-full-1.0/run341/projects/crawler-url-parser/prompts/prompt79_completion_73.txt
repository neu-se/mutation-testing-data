  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the text content of the links, and the code that extracts the links from the HTML would not be able to find the correct URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all the links on the page, instead of just the ones with the specified text content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a', el)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all the links inside the element `el`, instead of just the ones with the specified text content.

DONE.
