  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.length - 2` to get the index of the last character in the word, but this would result in an out-of-bounds error if the word was only one character long. Replacing it with `w.length - 1` would fix this issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.length - 2` to get the index of the last character in the word, but this would result in an out-of-bounds error if the word was only two characters long. Replacing it with `w.length - 3` would fix this issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.length - 2
