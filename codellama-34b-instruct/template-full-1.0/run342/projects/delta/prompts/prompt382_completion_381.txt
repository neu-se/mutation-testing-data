  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.delete(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator expects a number as its argument, while the original code fragment expects a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.retain(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operator expects an object as its argument, while the original code fragment expects a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.insert(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operator expects a string or a number as its argument, while the original code fragment expects an object.

DONE.
