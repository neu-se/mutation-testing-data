  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and adding the string '.json' to it would result in a different file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and replacing the string '.json' with an empty string would result in a different file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.split('.json')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and splitting the string on the substring '.json' and taking the first element of the resulting array would result in a different file name.

DONE.
