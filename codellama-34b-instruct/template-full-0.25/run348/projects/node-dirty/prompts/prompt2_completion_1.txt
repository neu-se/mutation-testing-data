  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `val` in the `_data` map, even if `val` is undefined. In the original code, the value is only set if `val` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the value associated with `key` from the `_data` map, even if `val` is undefined. In the original code, the value is only deleted if `val` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the entire `_data` map, even if `val` is undefined. In the original code, the map is only cleared if `val` is defined.

DONE.
