  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountriesForTimezone` is a different function than `getTimezone` and would return a different result in the map function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezones[name]` is an array of timezones, and returning the first element of the array (`[0]`) would result in a different value than returning the entire array (`timezones[name]`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries` is a different data structure than `timezones`, and `countries` is not a function that can be called with a `name` argument.

DONE.
