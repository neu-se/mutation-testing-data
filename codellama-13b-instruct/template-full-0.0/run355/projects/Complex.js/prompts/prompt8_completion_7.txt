  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 0 would cause the expression to evaluate to 0, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the expression to evaluate to a different value, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 would cause the expression to evaluate to a different value, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
