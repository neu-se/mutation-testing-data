  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This code fragment is a function call that checks if the complex number `z` is zero. It is a valid replacement for the original code fragment, which was `this['isZero']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is a function call that checks if the complex number `z` is infinite. It is a valid replacement for the original code fragment, which was `this['isZero']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This code fragment is a function call that checks if the complex number `z` is not a number (NaN). It is a valid replacement for the original code fragment, which was `this['isZero']`.

DONE.
