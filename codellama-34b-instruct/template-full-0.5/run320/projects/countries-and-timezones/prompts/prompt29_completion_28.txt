  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the offset to be calculated as a remainder, rather than a quotient.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the offset to be calculated as a product, rather than a quotient.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60.0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the offset to be calculated as a floating-point division, rather than an integer division.

DONE.
