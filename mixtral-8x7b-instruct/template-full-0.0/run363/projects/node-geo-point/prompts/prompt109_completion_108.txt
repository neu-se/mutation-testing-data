 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the tile's x-coordinate, causing the tile to be placed in a different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the size of the tiles, causing the tile to be placed in a different location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the size of the tiles, causing the tile to be placed in a different location.

DONE.
