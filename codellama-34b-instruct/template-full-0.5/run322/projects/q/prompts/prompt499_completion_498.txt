  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `name` is equal to `null`, but not if it is equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `name` is not equal to `null`, but not if it is equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof name === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `name` is equal to `undefined`, but not if it is equal to `null`.

DONE.
