  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of an array, and `this._data` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size()` is a method of an object, and `this._data` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an array of keys, and `length` is a property of an array.

DONE.
