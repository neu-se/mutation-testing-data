  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not()
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not()` is a method that returns the opposite of the result of the `tester` function, whereas the original code fragment `tester` simply calls the `tester` function without any modification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(test)` is a method that takes a function `test` as an argument and returns the opposite of the result of calling `test` with the same arguments. The original code fragment `tester` does not take any arguments, so this change would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(function (data) { return !test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(function (data) { return !test(data) })` is a method that takes a function
