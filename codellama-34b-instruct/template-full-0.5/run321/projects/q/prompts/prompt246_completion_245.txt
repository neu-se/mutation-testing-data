  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `hasStacks` is truthy, regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `hasStacks` is truthy, regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `hasStacks` is truthy, regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.

DONE.
