  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the logic of the code, causing the `return Complex.INFINITY;` statement to be executed when `Number.isFinite` would have returned `true`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a || b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the variables `a` and `b` as booleans, and return `true` if either of them is truthy, instead of checking if they are both finite numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `a` or `b` is NaN, instead of checking if they are both finite numbers.

DONE.
