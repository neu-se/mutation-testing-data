Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the argument from the `destroy` method, which means it will not be called with the correct context, potentially leading to resource leaks or unhandled errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy('error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `destroy` method to be called with an 'error' argument, which may not be the intended use case and could lead to unexpected behavior in error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `destroy` method may not properly clean up resources, leading to potential memory leaks or dangling references.

DONE.
