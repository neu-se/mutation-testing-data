  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of one or more letters, rather than the original regex which matches any sequence of one or more digits or letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[0-9]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of one or more digits, rather than the original regex which matches any sequence of one or more digits or letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of one or more letters or digits, rather than the original regex which matches any sequence of one or more digits or letters.

DONE.
