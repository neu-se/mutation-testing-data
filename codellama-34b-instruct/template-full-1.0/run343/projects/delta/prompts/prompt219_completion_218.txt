  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator changes the boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops >= other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the >= operator will return true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops > other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the > operator will return true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

DONE.
