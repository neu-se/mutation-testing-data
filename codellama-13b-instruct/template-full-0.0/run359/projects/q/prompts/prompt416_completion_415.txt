  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method is not defined on the `object` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method is not defined on the `object` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch()` method is not defined on the `object` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
