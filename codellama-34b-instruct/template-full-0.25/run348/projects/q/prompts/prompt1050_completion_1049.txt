  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a value, while `ends.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a value, while `closed.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a value, while `Q.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a different value.

DONE.
