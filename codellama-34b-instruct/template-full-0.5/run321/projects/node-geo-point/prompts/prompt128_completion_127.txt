  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the latitude of the current point and the longitude of the given point, rather than the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude, this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the latitude of the given point and the longitude of the current point, rather than the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + point.longitude, this.latitude + point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the sum of the longitudes of the two points and the sum of the latitudes of the two points, rather than the distance between the two points.

DONE.
