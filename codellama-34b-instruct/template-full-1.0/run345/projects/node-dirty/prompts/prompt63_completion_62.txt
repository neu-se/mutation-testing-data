  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('oops' + data);
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'oops' would be written to the file stream before the expected data, corrupting the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, 'utf8');
```
This would result in different behavior because the data would be written to the file stream using a different encoding than the original code, potentially corrupting the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, Buffer.from(data));
```
This would result in different behavior because the data would be written to the file stream using a different encoding than the original code, potentially corrupting the file.

DONE.
