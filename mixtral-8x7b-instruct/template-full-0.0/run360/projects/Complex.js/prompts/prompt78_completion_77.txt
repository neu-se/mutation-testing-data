 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i < tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the last element of the `tokens` array from being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an out-of-bounds error when trying to access the `tokens[i]` element, since `i` could be equal to `tokens.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i++, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `i` twice in each iteration, causing some elements of the `tokens` array to be skipped.

DONE.
