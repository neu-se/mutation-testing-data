  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it resolves the promise instead of rejecting it. This could cause the promise to be fulfilled even if there is an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', output.end()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it calls the `end()` method on the `output` stream instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause the stream to be closed even if there is an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it throws a new error instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause the program to crash or produce unexpected behavior.

DONE.
