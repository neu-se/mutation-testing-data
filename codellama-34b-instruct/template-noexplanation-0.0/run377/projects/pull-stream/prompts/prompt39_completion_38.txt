  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This code fragment will cause the `pull` function to return the last element of the `ref` array instead of the first element, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This code fragment will cause the `pull` function to return the first element of the `ref` array instead of the last element, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will cause the `pull` function to return a new array containing all the elements of the `ref` array except the first element, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
