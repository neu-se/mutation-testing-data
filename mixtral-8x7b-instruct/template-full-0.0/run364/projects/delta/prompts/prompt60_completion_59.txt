 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arg instanceof String && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is an instance of the `String` object, rather than checking if `arg` is a string primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof arg === 'object' && Array.isArray(arg) && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is an empty array, rather than checking if `arg` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof arg === 'number' && arg === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is a number equal to 0, rather than checking if `arg` is an empty string.

DONE.
