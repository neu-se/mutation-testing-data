  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then` is a different method than `Q(object).nodeify`. The `then` method is used to add callbacks to a promise, while the `nodeify` method is used to convert a promise to a Node.js-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).catch` is a different method than `Q(object).nodeify`. The `catch` method is used to add error handlers to a promise, while the `nodeify` method is used to convert a promise to a Node.js-style callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).finally` is a different method than `Q(object).nodeify`. The `finally` method is used to add
