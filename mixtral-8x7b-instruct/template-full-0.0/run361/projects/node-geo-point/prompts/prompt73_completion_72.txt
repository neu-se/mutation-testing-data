 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * radius
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated distance will now be a random value between 0 and the radius, instead of the intended distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated destination's distance from the original point will be twice the input distance, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
distance / radius
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated destination's distance from the original point will be a fraction of the input distance, depending on the value of the `radius` constant. This may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
