  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a simple value and does not have any properties or methods that can be accessed. In the original code, `arg` is an argument passed to the `async` function, and it is expected to be a promise or a thenable object. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to throw an error when it tries to access the `then` method of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string and does not have a `then` method. In the original code, `arg` is expected to be a promise or a thenable object, and the `then` method is called on it. Replacing it with a string would cause the function to throw an error when it tries to call the `then` method of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in
