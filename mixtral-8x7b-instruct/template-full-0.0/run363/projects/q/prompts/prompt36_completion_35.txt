 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the uncaught exception handling in browsers would not change, but the uncaught exception in Node.js would not be thrown synchronously, causing a delay in error reporting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the original synchronous exception handling in Node.js to be bypassed, and the exception would always be thrown asynchronously, even in Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof isNodeJS === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable would not be checked, and the code would always assume it is not in a Node.js environment, causing the exception to always be thrown asynchronously, even in Node.js.

DONE.
