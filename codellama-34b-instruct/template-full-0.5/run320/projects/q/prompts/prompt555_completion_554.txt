  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `errback`, and would cause the `when` function to return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `errback`, and would cause the `when` function to return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is a different value than `errback`, and would cause the `when` function to return a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
