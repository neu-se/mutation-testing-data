  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("doneLackingErr")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would warn about the string "doneLackingErr" instead of the error object that was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done( true )
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback immediately instead of only when the `read` callback has been called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("abort")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would warn about the string "abort" instead of the error object that was intended.

DONE.
