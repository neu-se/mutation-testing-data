  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a different method than `glob`, and it would not include the contents of the directory in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory
```
This would result in different behavior because `directory` is a different method than `glob`, and it would not include the contents of the directory in the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` is a different method than `glob`, and it would not include the contents of the directory in the archive.

DONE.
