  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{foo: options.bar}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different property `bar` instead of `foo` in the object literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * options.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the length of the options object by 2 instead of returning it directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the options object instead of returning it directly.

DONE.
