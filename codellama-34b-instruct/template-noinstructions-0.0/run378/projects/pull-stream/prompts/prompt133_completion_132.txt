  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle errors, while this new code fragment does. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting errors to be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'data')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle data, while this new code fragment does. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting data to be handled.

DONE.
