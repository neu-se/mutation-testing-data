  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method is called with a different length argument, which would result in a different substring being returned.
