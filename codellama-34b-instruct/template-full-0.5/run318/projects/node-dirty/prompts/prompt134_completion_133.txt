  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the key to be incremented by 1, which would result in a different key being used for the data lookup.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the key to lowercase, which would result in a different key being used for the data lookup.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method would return a new string that is a substring of the original key, starting from the second character. This would result in a different key being used for the data lookup.

DONE.
