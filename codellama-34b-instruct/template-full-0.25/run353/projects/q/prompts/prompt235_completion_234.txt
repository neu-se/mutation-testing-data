  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the resolved promise, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0], args[1], args[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first three arguments to the resolved promise, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first one to the resolved promise, instead of passing all the arguments.

DONE.
