  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test` function returns `true` for the value `data + 1`, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test` function returns `true` for the value `data - 1`, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test` function returns `true` for the value `data * 2`, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
