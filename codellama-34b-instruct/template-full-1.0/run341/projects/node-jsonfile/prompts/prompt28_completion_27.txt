  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, making the conditional expression always evaluate to `false`, even if the original code fragment would have evaluated to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const couldThrow = 'throws' in options ? options.throws : false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new variable `couldThrow` that would always be `false`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the original code fragment would have evaluated to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const couldThrow = 'throws' in options ? options.throws : !shouldThrow;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new variable `couldThrow` that would be the opposite of `shouldThrow`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to the opposite of what it would have evaluated to in
