  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, which could cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude values of `this` and `point`, which could cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the longitude values of `this` and `point`, which could cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect bearing.

DONE.
