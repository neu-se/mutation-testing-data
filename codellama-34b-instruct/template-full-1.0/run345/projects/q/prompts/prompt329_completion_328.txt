  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy behavior")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simply returns a rejected promise, while this code fragment throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a rejected promise with an error as its value, while this code fragment returns a resolved promise with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Buggy behavior"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simply returns a rejected promise, while this code fragment explicitly returns a rejected promise with an error.

DONE.
