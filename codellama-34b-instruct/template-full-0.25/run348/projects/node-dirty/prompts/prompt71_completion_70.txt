  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, indicating that the database is loaded, even if it is not actually loaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `null`, indicating that the database is not loaded, even if it actually is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value that is one greater than the actual size of the database, indicating that the database is larger than it actually is.

DONE.
