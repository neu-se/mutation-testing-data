Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"//"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path on double slashes, which is not a valid path separator, potentially leading to incorrect path handling and misclassification of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a backslash as the delimiter, which is not standard for URLs and could cause the path to be incorrectly parsed, leading to erroneous results in URL classification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path on spaces, which are not valid path separators in URLs, likely resulting in incorrect URL parts and misclassification of the URL type.

DONE.
