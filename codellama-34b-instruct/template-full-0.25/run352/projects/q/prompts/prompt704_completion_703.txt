  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, arguments)` would return a bound function that takes no arguments, whereas `array_slice` takes an array and a starting index as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, arguments, 1)` would return a bound function that takes no arguments and slices the `arguments` array starting from the second element, whereas `array_slice` takes an array and a starting index as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, arguments, 2)` would return a bound function that takes no arguments and slices the `arguments` array starting from the third
