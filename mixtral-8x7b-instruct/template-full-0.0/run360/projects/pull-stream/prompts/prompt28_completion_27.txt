 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new argument used for the `pull` function would be the second argument passed to the main function, instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `ref` array and shifts all other elements to the left, changing the arguments passed to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the first argument with a `null` value, which might cause the `pull` function to behave differently or throw an error if it doesn't handle `null` values correctly.

DONE.
