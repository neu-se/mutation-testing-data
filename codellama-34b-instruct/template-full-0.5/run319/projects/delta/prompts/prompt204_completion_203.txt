  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is a property of the `Delta` class, and `rest` is a method of the `OpIterator` class. Using `ops` instead of `rest` would result in an infinite loop, as the `ops` property would always refer to the same object, causing the `while` loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `ops` except for the first element. This would cause the `while` loop to iterate over a different set of elements, potentially resulting in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.reverse()` would return a new array containing the elements of `ops` in reverse order. This would cause the `while` loop to iterate over
