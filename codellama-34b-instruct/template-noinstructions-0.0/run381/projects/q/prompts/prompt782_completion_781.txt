  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` method to always return a promise that is fulfilled with the value `regardless`, regardless of the state of the input promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("regardless")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` method to always throw an error with the message "regardless", regardless of the state of the input promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("regardless")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` method to always return a promise that is rejected with the reason "regardless", regardless of the state of the input promises.

DONE.
