  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `aborted` variable, which would cause the callback to be invoked with a different argument than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `error` property of the `aborted` object, which would cause the callback to be invoked with a different argument than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `aborted` object as a function, which would cause the callback to be invoked with a different argument than the original code fragment.

DONE.
