  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be increased by 1, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be decreased by 1, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be doubled, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

DONE.
