  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` would retain the text instead of deleting it, which would cause the `diff()` function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` would insert text instead of deleting it, which would cause the `diff()` function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` would delete the text, which would cause the `diff()` function to produce a different output.

DONE.
