  Sure, here are three possible replacement code fragments for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract a different substring from the `part` string. In the original code, `part.slice(1)` extracts the substring starting from the second character of `part`, but with `part.slice(2)` it would extract the substring starting from the third character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract a different substring from the `part` string. In the original code, `part.slice(1)` extracts the substring starting from the second character of `part`, but with `part.slice(3)` it would extract the substring starting from the fourth character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1) + part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it
