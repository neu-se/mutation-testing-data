  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `θ` variable, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2` constant is multiplied with the `θ` variable, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is squared, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

DONE.
