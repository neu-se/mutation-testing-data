Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise when the asynchronous operation completes, it would immediately reject the promise, leading to an error state without executing the intended success callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise without waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete, potentially returning a value that is not yet ready, which could lead to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the promise to not have a proper resolver function, leading to a failure in handling the callback and potentially leaving the promise in a pending state indefinitely.

DONE.
