  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the deletion operation is checked, but in this modified code, the retain operation is checked instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the delete operation is checked, but in this modified code, the insert operation is checked instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the delete operation is checked for a positive value, but in this modified code, the delete operation is checked for a negative value instead.

DONE.
