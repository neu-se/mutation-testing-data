  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because a TypeError would be thrown when trying to call the `apply()` method on `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `apply()` on `null` would throw a TypeError, whereas calling `apply()` on `value` would not throw an error and would simply return `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.apply` is a function expression that, when called, would return a new function that is equivalent to the `apply()` method on `value`. However, calling `value.apply()` would not throw an error and would simply return `value`.

DONE.
