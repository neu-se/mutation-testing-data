  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).npost(name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `npost` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).ninvoke(name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ninvoke` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
