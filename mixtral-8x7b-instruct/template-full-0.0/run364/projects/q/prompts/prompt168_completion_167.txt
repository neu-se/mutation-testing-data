 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line !== null && line !== undefined && !isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for `null` and `undefined`, which the original code does not. This could mask certain errors or lead to unexpected behavior if `line` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(isInternalFrame(line) || isNodeFrame(line)) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses logical negation (`!`) to combine the two conditions, rather than using the `&&` operator. This could lead to different evaluation order and potentially unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(window, 'line') && !isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether `window` has an own property called `line`,
