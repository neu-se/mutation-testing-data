  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This change would cause the function to behave differently for non-string `options` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This change would cause the function to behave differently for non-string `options` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. This change would cause the function to behave differently for null `options` arguments.

DONE.
