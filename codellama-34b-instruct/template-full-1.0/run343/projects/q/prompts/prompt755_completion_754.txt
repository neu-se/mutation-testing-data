  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.allResolved = function () {
    return Q.when(this).allSettled();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method implementation to always return a rejected promise with an error indicating that the `allSettled` method is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.allResolved = function () {
    return when(Promise.allSettled(this));
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method implementation to always return a resolved promise with an array of promises that are all settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.allResolved = function () {
    return Q.allSettled(this);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method implementation to always return a resolved promise with an array of promises that are all settled.
