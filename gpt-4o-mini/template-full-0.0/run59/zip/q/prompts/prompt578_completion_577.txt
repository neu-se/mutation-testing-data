Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to throw an exception immediately instead of continuing to the next iteration, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `callback` function to `null`, which may lead to incorrect behavior if the function relies on `this` being set to the generator's context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that always calls `continuer` with the verb "next", bypassing the intended control flow of the generator and potentially causing it to skip over important logic.

DONE.
