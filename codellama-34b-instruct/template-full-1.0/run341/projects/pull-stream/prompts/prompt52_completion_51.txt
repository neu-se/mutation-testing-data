  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `read` is a function and throws an error if it is not, while the new code will always return `null` regardless of the value of `read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `read` is a function and throws an error if it is not, while the new code will always return an empty object regardless of the value of `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `read` is a function and throws an error if it is not, while the new code will always return `null` regardless of the value of `read`.

DONE.
