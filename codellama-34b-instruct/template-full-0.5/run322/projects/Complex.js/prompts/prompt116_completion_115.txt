  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable from `b`, and the code would be using the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding `a` and `b` together, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
