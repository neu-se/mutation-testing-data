  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is not zero.

DONE.
