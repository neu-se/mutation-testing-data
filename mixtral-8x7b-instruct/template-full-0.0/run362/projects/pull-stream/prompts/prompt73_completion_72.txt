 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `read` function, potentially causing issues if the `read` function relies on the value of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `abort` as the first argument to `read`, whereas the original code only passes `abort` if it is truthy. This could cause issues if `read` behaves differently depending on the value of its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `read` global variable, rather than the `read` variable declared within the `drain` function. This could cause issues if a global `read` variable exists and behaves differently than the local `read` variable.
