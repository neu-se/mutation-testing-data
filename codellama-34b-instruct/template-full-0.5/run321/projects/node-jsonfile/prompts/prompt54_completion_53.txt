  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter would be decremented by 1, which could affect the indentation of the JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could affect the indentation of the JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter would be multiplied by 2, which could affect the indentation of the JSON string.

DONE.
