  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different method than "post", and it would cause the promise to resolve with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.concat(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a different value, as the `nodeArgs` array would have an extra element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a different value, as the `nodeArgs` array would be missing its first element.

DONE.
