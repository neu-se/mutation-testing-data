  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the method on the `descriptor` object, which would cause the method to be invoked with the `promise` object as the `this` value, rather than the `descriptor` object. This could potentially cause the method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke the method on the `descriptor` object, which would cause the method to be invoked with the `promise` object as the `this` value, rather than the `descriptor` object. This could potentially cause the method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise)(args)
