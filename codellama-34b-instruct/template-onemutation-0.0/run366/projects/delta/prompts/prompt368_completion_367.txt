  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` without the parentheses would return the function itself, which is not what we want in this context.

DONE.
