  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would insert the new operation at the wrong index, causing the operations to be applied in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would insert the new operation at the wrong index, causing the operations to be applied in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would insert the new operation at the wrong index, causing the operations to be applied in the wrong order.

DONE.
