  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a rejected promise, so the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a rejected promise, so the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(reason)` creates a new rejected promise with the same reason as the original promise, so the `untrackRejection` function would be called, but the `unhandledRejections` array would still be updated with the original promise, not the new one.

DONE.
