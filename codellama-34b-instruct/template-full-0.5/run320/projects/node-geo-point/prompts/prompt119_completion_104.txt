  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points with an offset of 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points with a factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points with a difference of 90 degrees.

DONE.
