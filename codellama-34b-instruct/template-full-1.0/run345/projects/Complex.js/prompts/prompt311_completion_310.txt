  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` are different mathematical functions, and using `Math.sin()` instead of `Math.cos()` would lead to incorrect results in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan()` is a different mathematical function than `Math.cos()` and `Math.sin()`, and using it instead would lead to incorrect results in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var d = a * a + (1.0 - b) * (1.0 - b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `d` variable, which is used in the `acos` and `asin` methods. Using a different formula for `d` would lead to incorrect results in the code.

DONE.
