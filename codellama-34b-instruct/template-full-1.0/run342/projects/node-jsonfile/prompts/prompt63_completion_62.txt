  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` converts the entire string to uppercase, while `toString()` only converts the first character to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr(1)` returns the substring starting from the second character, while `toString()` returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt(0)` returns the character at the first index, while `toString()` returns the entire string.

DONE.
