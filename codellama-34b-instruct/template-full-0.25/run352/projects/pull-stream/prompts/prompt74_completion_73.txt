  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the logical AND operator. This would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the logical NOT operator. This would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the strict equality operator. This would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
