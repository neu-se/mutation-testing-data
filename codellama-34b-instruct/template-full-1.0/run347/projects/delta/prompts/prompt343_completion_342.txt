  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined for the `AttributeMap` class, and the code would therefore throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined for the `AttributeMap` class, and the code would therefore throw a `TypeError` at runtime.
