This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match the default file extension, which is ".pdf" in this case. As a result, the code would not be able to extract the file extension from the URL, and the extracted URL would not include the file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match a space character instead of the default file extension. As a result, the code would extract the file extension from the URL as a space character, which would not be a valid file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match a period character instead of the default file extension. As a result, the code would extract the file extension from
