  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof newOp.insert` is expected to return `string` or `object` instead of `number`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert.length > 0 &&
          lastOp.insert.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the length of the `insert` property is greater than 0, instead of checking the type of the `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert &&
          lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `insert` property is truthy instead of checking the type of the `insert` property.

DONE.
