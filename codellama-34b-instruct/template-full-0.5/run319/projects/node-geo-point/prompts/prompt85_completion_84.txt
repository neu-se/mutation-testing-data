  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the destination point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the starting point, while `φ1` is the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a random element to the calculation, which would cause the destination point to be different every time the function is called.

DONE.
