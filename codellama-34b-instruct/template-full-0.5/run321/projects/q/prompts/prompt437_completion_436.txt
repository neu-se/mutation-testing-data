  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is in the last index of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if it exists in the array at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[promise]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is a key in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if it exists in the array at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise in unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is a value in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if it exists in the array at all.

DONE.
