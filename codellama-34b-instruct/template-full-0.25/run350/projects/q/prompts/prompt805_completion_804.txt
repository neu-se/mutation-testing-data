  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called twice, once for the fulfilled promise and once for the rejected promise, which is not the intended behavior of the `finally` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](callback).then(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called twice, once for the fulfilled promise and once for the rejected promise, which is not the intended behavior of the `finally` method. Additionally, the `then` method would be called twice, which would cause the promise to be resolved twice, which is not the intended behavior of the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](callback).then(callback, callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called twice, once for the fulfilled
