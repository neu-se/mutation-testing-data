  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the first element, while the new code fragment slices it from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the first element, while the new code fragment slices it from the third element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the first element, while the new code fragment slices it from the fourth element.

DONE.
