 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an integer to `getCountry` instead of a variable `countryId`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'someCountryId'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes a string literal to `getCountry` instead of a variable `countryId`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `options` object instead of the `countryId` variable.

DONE.
