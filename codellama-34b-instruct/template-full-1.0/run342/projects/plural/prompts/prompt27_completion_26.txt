  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in the wrong plural form for words that end in -us, such as "cactus" which would become "cactuss" instead of "cacti".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in the wrong plural form for words that end in -um, such as "erratum" which would become "erratum" instead of "errata".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - "us".length
```
This would result in the wrong plural form for words that end in -us, such as "cactus" which would become "cactuss" instead of "cacti".

DONE.
