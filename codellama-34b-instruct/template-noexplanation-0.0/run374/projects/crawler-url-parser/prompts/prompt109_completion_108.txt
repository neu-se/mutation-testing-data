  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This change will cause the `urlMap` to have a different key than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.protocol
```
This change will cause the `urlMap` to have a different key than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This change will cause the `urlMap` to have a different key than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the `extract` function.

DONE.
