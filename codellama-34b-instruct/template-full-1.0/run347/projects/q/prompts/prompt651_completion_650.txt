  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would be called with the `get` operation instead of `post`, which would result in the promise for the property value instead of the return value of the method invocation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would be called with the `delete` operation instead of `post`, which would result in the promise for the property being deleted instead of the return value of the method invocation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would be called with the `set` operation instead of `post`, which would result in the promise for the property being set to the new value instead of the return value of the method invocation.

DONE.
