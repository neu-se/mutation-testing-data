  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the check `i < length` is now inclusive, meaning that the loop will iterate one more time than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the check `i < length` is now checking if `i` is greater than 0, rather than less than `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== length
```
This would result in different behavior because the check `i < length` is now checking if `i` is not equal to `length`, rather than less than `length`.

DONE.
