 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` returns a path with platform-specific separators, while `path.resolve` returns an absolute path with the correct separator for the platform.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the destination to the parent directory of the original `options.dest`, instead of resolving it to an absolute path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./' + options.dest
