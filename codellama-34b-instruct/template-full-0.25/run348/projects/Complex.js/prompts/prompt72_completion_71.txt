  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `==` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, `tokens` is an array, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the `===` operator would return `false` even if `tokens` is an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array returns the number of elements in the array, whereas the `===` operator checks for value and type equality. In this case, `tokens.length` would return `0` if `tokens` is an empty array, but `0` is a primitive value, so the `===` operator would return `false` if `tokens` is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === undefined
