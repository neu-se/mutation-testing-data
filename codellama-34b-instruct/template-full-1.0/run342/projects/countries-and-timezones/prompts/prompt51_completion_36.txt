  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.values` returns an array of the given object's own enumerable property values. Replacing `Object.keys` with `Object.values` would cause the code to have a different result, which could expose bugs or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs from the given object's own enumerable properties. Replacing `Object.keys` with `Object.entries` would cause the code to have a different result, which could expose bugs or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
