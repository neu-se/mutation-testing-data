  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `push`, and it would cause the `delta` object to retain the deleted content instead of pushing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different method than `push`, and it would cause the `delta` object to delete the inserted content instead of pushing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delta` object to retain the deleted content with an empty attribute map, which would be different from the original behavior where the attribute map is not empty.

DONE.
