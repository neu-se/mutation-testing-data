  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would pass the error object to the callback, while `null` would pass `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would pass the error object to the callback, while `undefined` would pass `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('some error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would pass the error object to the callback, while `new Error('some error message')` would pass a new error object with a different message.

DONE.
