  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(args || defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is called differently in the original code, and it would not behave as expected when passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(args, defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is called differently in the original code, and it would not behave as expected when passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(args && defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is called differently in the original code, and it would not behave as expected when passed as an argument.

DONE.
