  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is defined. If `StopIteration` is defined, the replacement code fragment will evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is an object. If `StopIteration` is an object, the replacement code fragment will evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is a function. If `StopIteration
