  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property of the `options` object is not being used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property of the `options` object is not being used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property of the `options` object is not being used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
