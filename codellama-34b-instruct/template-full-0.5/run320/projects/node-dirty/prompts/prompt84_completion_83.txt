  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for a newline character, while the modified code fragment is checking for an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for a newline character, while the modified code fragment is checking for a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for a newline character, while the modified code fragment is checking for a null value.

DONE.
