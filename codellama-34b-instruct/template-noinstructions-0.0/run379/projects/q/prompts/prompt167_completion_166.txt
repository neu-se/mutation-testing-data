  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the second element instead of the first, potentially causing the first element to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < lines.length - 1; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop one iteration earlier, potentially causing the last element to be skipped.

DONE.
