  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `buildTimezonesMap` is called with the `data` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to a bug in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezonesMap` is called with the `data` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to a bug in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `buildCountry` is called with the `data` and `id` arguments, which are not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the function to return a different result
