  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the arguments `1` and `0`, instead of the expected `accum` and `curr` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the arguments `1` and `1`, instead of the expected `accum` and `curr` arguments, and the accumulator would be initialized to `1` instead of `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the arguments `0` and `1`, instead of the expected `accum` and `curr` arguments, and the accumulator would be initialized to `0` instead of `1`.

DONE.
