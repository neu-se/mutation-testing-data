  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong value for the `thisArg` parameter to the `callback` function, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(this[index], basis, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `callback` function in a different order, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different value for the `this` context when calling the `callback` function, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
