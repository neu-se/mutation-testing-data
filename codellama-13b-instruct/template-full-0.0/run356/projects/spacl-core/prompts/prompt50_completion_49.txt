  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the code to return a substring of the original string starting from the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with two arguments, `0` and `1`, which would cause the code to return a substring of the original string starting from the first character and ending at the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with two arguments, `1` and `0`, which would cause the code to return an empty string.

DONE.
