  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `extractFilename`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `extractFilename`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `extractFilename` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `extractFilename` is not `true`.

DONE.
