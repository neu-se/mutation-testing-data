  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw err
```
This would result in different behavior because throwing an error would cause the program to exit immediately, whereas the original code fragment would only pass the error to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error to the callback, whereas this replacement would pass null as both the error and the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with the error and the data, whereas this replacement would call the callback with the error and null as the data.

DONE.
