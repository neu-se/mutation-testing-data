 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns an array of elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. In this case, the output would be an array of countries instead of a function to get country objects for the timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
values.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` reduces the array to a single output value by repeatedly applying a function to each element and the accumulator, while `map` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. In this case, the output would be a single object containing all countries for the timezone instead of a function to get country objects for the timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because
