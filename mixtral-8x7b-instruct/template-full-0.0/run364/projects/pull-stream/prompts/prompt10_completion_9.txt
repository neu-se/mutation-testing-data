 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a instanceof Function && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `instanceof` operator instead of `typeof`, and checks if `a` is an instance of the `Function` constructor instead of checking if `a` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof a && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the strict equality operator (`===`) instead of the loose equality operator (`==`). This means that it will only return true if `a` is a function and its `length` property is exactly equal to 1, rather than converting the types before comparing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the loose equality operator (`==`) instead of the strict equality operator (`===`). This
