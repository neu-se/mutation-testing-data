 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` always returns `undefined`, whereas the original code might execute a function passed as a task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the `task` argument would cause an error in the `runSingle` function, which expects a function to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because an array is being passed instead of a function, which would cause an error in the `runSingle` function, which expects a function to be passed.

DONE.
