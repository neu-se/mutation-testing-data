  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to run twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.task
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to run only once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to perform no action at all.

DONE.
