  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a method that is called on the `Promise.prototype` object, and replacing it with `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a method that is called on the `Promise.prototype` object, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is defined in the scope of the `all` function, and replacing `dispatch` with `deferred` would cause the function to attempt to invoke the `deferred` function as a method, which would likely result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
