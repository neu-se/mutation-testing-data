 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now appends 'es' instead of 's', which is inconsistent with the original code and other parts of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'S' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function converts the input to uppercase and appends 'S', which is not the desired behavior and may cause issues in the rest of the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return plural(w) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function calls the `plural` function recursively, causing an infinite loop and eventually leading to a stack overflow.

DONE.
