  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value stored at a given key in the database, while swapping it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead, which could break the code that relies on the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value stored at a given key in the database, while swapping it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead, which could break the code that relies on the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value stored at a given key in the database, while swapping it with a function expression that returns nothing (i.e., an empty function) would cause the function to return a function instead of the intended value. This would likely break the code that relies on the returned
