  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `promise` object onto the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `trackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `promise` object onto the `unhandledRejections` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `trackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `reason` object onto the `unhandledReasons` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `trackRejection` function.

DONE.
