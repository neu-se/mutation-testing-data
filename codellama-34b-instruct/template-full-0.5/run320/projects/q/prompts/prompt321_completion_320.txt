  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be replaced with `null`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `promise` object's `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `promise` object's `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be replaced with the string `"hello"`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `promise` object's `then` method.

DONE.
