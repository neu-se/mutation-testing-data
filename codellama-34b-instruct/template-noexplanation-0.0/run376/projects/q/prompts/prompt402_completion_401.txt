  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This code fragment will return the reason instead of throwing it, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This code fragment will throw a new error with the reason as the message, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q.reject(reason); }
```
This code fragment will return a rejected promise with the reason as the rejection reason, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
