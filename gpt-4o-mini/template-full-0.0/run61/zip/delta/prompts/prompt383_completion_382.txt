Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` will return the maximum of the two lengths instead of the minimum, potentially causing the algorithm to process more characters than intended, leading to incorrect transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the length will always increase the number of characters processed, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because using `0` would cause the algorithm to always process zero characters, effectively skipping the transformation logic and potentially resulting in no changes being applied to the `delta`.

DONE.
