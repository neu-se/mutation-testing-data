  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument to the `array_slice` function, which would cause the function to return a slice of the array starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument to the `array_slice` function, which would cause the function to return a slice of the array starting from the first element and ending at the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument to the `array_slice` function, which would cause the function to return a slice of the array starting from the second element and ending at the third element.

DONE.
