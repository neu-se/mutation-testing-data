  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor.get(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op]` accesses the property of the `descriptor` object with the key `op`, while `descriptor.get(op)` calls the `get` method of the `descriptor` object and passes `op` as an argument. If the `descriptor` object does not have a `get` method, this would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor.set(op, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op]` accesses the property of the `descriptor` object with the key `op`, while `descriptor.set(op, value)` calls the `set` method of the `descriptor` object and passes `op` and `value` as arguments. If the `descriptor` object does not have a `set` method, this would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
