  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes a single argument to the `mapper` function, but this new code fragment passes two arguments. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a non-null value to the `mapper` function, but this new code fragment passes a null value. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a non-null value to the `mapper` function as the first argument, but this new code fragment passes a null value as the first argument. This could cause the `mapper` function to
