  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the replacement code fragment is a function call. This would cause the function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to the `abortCb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the replacement code fragment is a function call with a specific `this` context. This would cause the function to be executed with a different `this` context, which could potentially have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the replacement code fragment is a function binding with a specific `this` context. This would cause the function to be executed with a different `
