  Option 1:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide the `this` keyword as an argument to `array_slice`, which would produce a different result.

Option 2:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide `null` as an argument to `array_slice`, which would produce a different result.

Option 3:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide `undefined` as an argument to `array_slice`, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
