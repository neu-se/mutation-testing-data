  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path specification does not begin with a slash, while the replaced code fragment checks if the path specification begins with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path specification does not begin with a slash, while the replaced code fragment checks if the path specification begins with a slash and is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path specification does not begin with a slash, while the replaced code fragment checks if the path specification begins with a slash and is not undefined.

DONE.
