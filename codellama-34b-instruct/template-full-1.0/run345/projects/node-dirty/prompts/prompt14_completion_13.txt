  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push `null` to the callback array, which could cause an error if the callbacks are expected to be functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the callback array with the current callback, but it would not push it to the end of the array, as `push` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[cbs.length - 1] = cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last element in the callback array with the current callback, rather than pushing it to the end of the array.

DONE.
