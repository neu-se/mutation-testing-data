Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the scaling factor from 10 to 5, which would affect the rounding precision of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the base of the exponentiation from 10 to 2, which would lead to a different scaling factor for rounding the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the absolute value of `places`, which could lead to unintended rounding behavior if `places` is negative, potentially causing incorrect results.

DONE.
