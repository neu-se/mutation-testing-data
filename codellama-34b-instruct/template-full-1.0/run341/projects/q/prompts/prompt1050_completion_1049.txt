  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because while `ends.resolve` would resolve the promise, `ends.reject` would reject it. This would cause the `get` function to fail and throw an error, even if the queue was not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because while `ends.resolve` would resolve the promise, `closed.resolve` would resolve the `closed` promise, which is not related to the queue. This would cause the `get` function to return a resolved promise, even if the queue was empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because while `ends.resolve` would resolve the promise, passing `null` would fail the promise and throw an error. This would cause the `get` function to return a rejected promise, even if the queue was not empty.

DONE.
