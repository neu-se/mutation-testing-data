  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter, which would return a timezone object with the given name, rather than the `getTimezone` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the given name from the `timezones` object, rather than the `getTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with the `data` and `name` parameters, which would return a new timezone object with the given name, rather than the `getTimezone` function.

DONE.
