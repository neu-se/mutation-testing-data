 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c === '⁻'
```
This would result in different behavior because the character '⁻' is not a valid minus sign in JavaScript, and the condition would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c.toLowerCase() === '-'
