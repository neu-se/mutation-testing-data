  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by the number of places, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the product of the imaginary part of the complex number and the number of places, instead of just multiplying them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the product of the imaginary part of the complex number and the number of places by 2, instead of just multiplying them.

DONE.
