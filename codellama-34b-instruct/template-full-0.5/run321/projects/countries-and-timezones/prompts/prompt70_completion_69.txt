  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function is not called, and the `timezones` object is not updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` object is updated with a null value, instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = buildTimezone(data, name);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function is called with the wrong arguments, and the resulting timezone object is not the expected one.

DONE.
