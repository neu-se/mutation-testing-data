  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is called on a different string than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is called on a different string than the original code, and the replacement string is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is called on a different string than the original code, and the replacement string is different.

DONE.
