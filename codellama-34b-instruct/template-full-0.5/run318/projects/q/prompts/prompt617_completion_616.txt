  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different method name and would result in a different operation being performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a different method name and would result in a different operation being performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is a different method name and would result in a different operation being performed.

DONE.
