  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` value would be different, potentially changing the target object for the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would ignore the `arguments` slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first argument from the `apply` call, potentially changing the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
