  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onResolve` function is not defined and would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onReject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onReject` function is not defined and would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function is not defined and would cause a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
