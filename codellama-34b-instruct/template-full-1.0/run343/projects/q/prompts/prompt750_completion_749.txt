  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise when `pendingCount` is 0, but the replaced code fragment would reject the promise when `pendingCount` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise when `pendingCount` is 0, but the replaced code fragment would reject the promise when `pendingCount` is 0 or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise when `pendingCount` is 0, but the replaced code fragment would not reject the promise when `pendingCount` is 0 or positive.

DONE.
