  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.delete()` deletes the specified number of characters from the delta, whereas `retDelta.push()` adds a new operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.retain()` retains the specified number of characters from the delta, whereas `retDelta.push()` adds a new operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.insert()` inserts the specified number of characters into the delta, whereas `retDelta.push()` adds a new operation to the delta.

DONE.
