  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the attributes of the next operation in the `other` delta, rather than the attributes of the current operation. This could cause the `eachLine` method to return a different result than the original code.
