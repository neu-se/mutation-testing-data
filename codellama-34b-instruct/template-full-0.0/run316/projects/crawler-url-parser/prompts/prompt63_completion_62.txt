  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` is a different property than `ret.host`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split('.').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last part of the hostname, which may not be the same as the hostname itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.replace(/^www\./, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." prefix from the hostname, which may not be present in all cases.

DONE.
