  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.call` is a different function than `continuer.bind`, and it may have different effects on the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.apply` is a different function than `continuer.bind`, and it may have different effects on the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(null)` is a different function than `continuer.bind`, and it may have different effects on the surrounding code.

DONE.
