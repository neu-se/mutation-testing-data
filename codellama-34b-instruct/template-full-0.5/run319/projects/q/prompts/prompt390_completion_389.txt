  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` callback would be called instead of the `rejected` callback, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<function>
```
This would result in different behavior because a function would be called instead of a string, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<undefined>
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be passed as the callback instead of a string, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
