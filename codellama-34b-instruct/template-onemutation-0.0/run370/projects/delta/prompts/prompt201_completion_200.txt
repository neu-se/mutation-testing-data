  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object, while the buggy code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `rest` variable, which is a `Delta` object.

DONE.
