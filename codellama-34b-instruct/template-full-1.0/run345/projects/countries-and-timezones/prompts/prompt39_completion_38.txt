  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries.forEach(c => c.population *= 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the population of each country in the data file, which may not be intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries.filter(c => c.population < 10000000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return countries with a population less than 10 million, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.cities;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different set of data (the cities in the data file) rather than the countries.

DONE.
