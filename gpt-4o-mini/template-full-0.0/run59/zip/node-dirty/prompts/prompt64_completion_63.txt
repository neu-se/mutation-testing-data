Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of ending the write stream, it would attempt to write data to it, which could lead to an error if the stream is not writable or if there is no data to write.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroySoon
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySoon` is not a valid method on the write stream, which would throw an error when trying to call it, causing the application to crash instead of gracefully closing the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end('data')
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `end` with a string argument would write that string to the stream before closing it, potentially leading to unexpected data being written to the file instead of just closing the stream.

DONE.
