  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` prototype, while the buggy code fragment refers to the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method directly, while the buggy code fragment uses the `bind` method to bind the `dispatch` method to the `Promise` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method directly, while the buggy code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `dispatch` method with the `this` context and the `arguments` object.

DONE.
