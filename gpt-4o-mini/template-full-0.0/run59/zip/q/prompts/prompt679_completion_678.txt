Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "call" implies invoking a function directly rather than applying arguments to it, which changes the intended functionality of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"applyAsync"
```
This would result in different behavior because "applyAsync" suggests a different method that may not exist, leading to a potential runtime error or unexpected behavior when trying to call a non-existent method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"execute"
```
This would result in different behavior because "execute" does not correspond to the expected operation of applying a function with arguments, which could lead to incorrect handling of the function invocation.

DONE.
