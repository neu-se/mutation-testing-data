  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the method being called from "post" to "apply".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the method being called from "apply" to "post".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the method being called from "apply" to "post" and would also change the number of arguments passed to the method.

DONE.
