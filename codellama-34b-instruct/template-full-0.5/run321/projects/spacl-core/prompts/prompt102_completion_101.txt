  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx || {}` would always return an empty object, whereas the original code `ctx` would return the `ctx` object if it exists, or `undefined` if it doesn't. This change would cause the `query` method to always return `null` if `ctx` is not defined, regardless of the other arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx && ctx.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx && ctx.length > 0` would only return `true` if `ctx` is defined and has a length greater than 0. The original code `ctx` would return `true` if `ctx` is defined, regardless of its length. This change would cause the `query` method to return `null` if `ctx` is not defined or has a length of 0, regardless of the other arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
