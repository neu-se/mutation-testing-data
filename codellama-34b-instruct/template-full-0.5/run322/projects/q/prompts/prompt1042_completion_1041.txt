  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.then` is a different method than `ends.promise.get`, and it would not retrieve the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.catch` is a different method than `ends.promise.get`, and it would not retrieve the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.finally` is a different method than `ends.promise.get`, and it would not retrieve the same value.

DONE.
