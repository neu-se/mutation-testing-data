  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise, while this code rejects it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise, while this code sends a notification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with the rejection reason, while this code resolves the promise with a resolved promise that is rejected with the rejection reason.

DONE.
