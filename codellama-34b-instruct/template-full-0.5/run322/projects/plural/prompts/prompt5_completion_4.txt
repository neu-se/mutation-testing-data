  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString.call`, and it may not produce the same result when called on the same object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.toString.call` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString.call`, and it may not produce the same result when called on the same object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.prototype.toString.call` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString.call`, and it may not produce the same result when called on the same object.

DONE.
