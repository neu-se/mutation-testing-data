 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would immediately reject the promise with a `TypeError`: "Cannot read property 'then' of null".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would immediately resolve the promise with the value `true`, instead of waiting for the specified timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would immediately resolve the promise with an empty array `[]`, instead of waiting for the specified timeout.

DONE.
