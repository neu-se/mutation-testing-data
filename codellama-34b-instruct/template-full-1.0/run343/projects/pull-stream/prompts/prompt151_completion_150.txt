  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return a value of null, whereas the original code would return the value of the variable "abort".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort != null ? cb(null, onAbort) : cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always check if the variable "onAbort" is not null before calling the callback function "cb", whereas the original code would only check if "abort" is not null before calling "cb".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always check if the value of "value" is not null, whereas the original code would only check if the value of "abort" is not null.

DONE.
