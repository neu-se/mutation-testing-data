  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `off` method instead of `on`. This could potentially cause the event listener to be removed, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This code fragment uses the `emit` method to trigger the `error` event, which could cause the `reject` function to be called. This could potentially lead to the promise being rejected, even if the `output` stream is not actually in an error state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once
```
This code fragment uses the `once` method to add a one-time event listener for the `error` event. This could potentially cause the `reject` function to be called multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
