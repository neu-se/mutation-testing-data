  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently when encountering a retain operation with a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is not null, while this replacement checks if it is null. This could cause the code to behave differently when encountering a retain operation with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a number. This could cause the code to behave differently when encountering a retain operation with a number value.
