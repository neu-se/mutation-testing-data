  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isInfinite` method, causing the `if` statement to be entered even if the value is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the value is a finite number, which is the opposite of what the `isInfinite` method does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the value is not a number, which is different from checking if the value is infinite.

DONE.
