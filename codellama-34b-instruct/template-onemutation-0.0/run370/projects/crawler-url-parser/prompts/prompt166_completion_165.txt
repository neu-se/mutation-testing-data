  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference in the number of parts is equal to -1, which means that the link URL has one more part than the page URL. However, if the placeholder is replaced with `part_count_diff == 1`, the code will check if the difference in the number of parts is equal to 1, which means that the link URL has one less part than the page URL. This would result in the opposite behavior, where the link would be considered as an "uplevel" link instead of a "sublevel" link.

DONE.
