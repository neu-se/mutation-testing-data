Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(data) { return data }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the test function to always return the input data itself, effectively negating the intended filtering logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(data) { return false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it makes the test function always return false, causing the filter to include all data instead of excluding it based on the original test condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(data) { return !data }
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the truthiness of the data, leading to a filter that excludes truthy values instead of applying the original test logic.

DONE.
