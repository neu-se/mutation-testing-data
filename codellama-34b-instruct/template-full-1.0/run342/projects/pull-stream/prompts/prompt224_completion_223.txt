  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, which would cause the `filter` function to always return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with a different argument `data` instead of the original argument `test`. This would cause the `filter` function to filter differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called without any arguments, which would cause an error if the `test` function expects at least one argument.

DONE.
