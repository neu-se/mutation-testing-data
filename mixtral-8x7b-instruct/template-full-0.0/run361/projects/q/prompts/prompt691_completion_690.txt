 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"spy", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` method would look for a `spy` method in the object instead of `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects the `this` value to be passed as the first argument, and `null` is a valid value, but it might break the code if the code relies on the `this` value being set to the global object (`window` in a browser).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array-like object as its second argument, but it would receive an array instead. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` because the `apply
