  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.sqrt` produce different results when applied to negative numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the default `Math.pow` function with a user-defined function, which could have different behavior and produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.max` produce different results when applied to different numbers.

DONE.
