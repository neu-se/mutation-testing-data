  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with the `this` value bound to `object`, which would cause the `npost` method to be called on a different object than the one that was originally intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would call the `npost` method on a different object than the one that was originally intended, and the `this` value inside the `npost` method would be set to `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would call the `npost` method on a different object than the one that was originally intended, and the `this` value inside the `npost` method would be set to `object
