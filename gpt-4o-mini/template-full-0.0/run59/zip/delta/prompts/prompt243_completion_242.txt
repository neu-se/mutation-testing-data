Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the first `0` length of operations, potentially skipping over important operations that should be retained or deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one more operation than available, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or unintended behavior if the length of operations is equal to `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more operation than what is currently available to peek, which could lead to incorrect state management in the delta operations.

DONE.
