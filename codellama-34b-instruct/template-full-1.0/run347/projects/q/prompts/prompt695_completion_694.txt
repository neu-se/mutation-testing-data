  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `dispatch` method, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when `Q(object).dispatch(...)` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `dispatch` method, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when `Q(object).dispatch(...)` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`true`
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not a function, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when `Q.mapply(object, name, args)` is called.

DONE.
