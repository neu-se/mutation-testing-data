  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `flush` is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw Error` statement would cause an exception to be thrown, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value onto the `laterQueue` array, which would not occur in the original code.

DONE.
