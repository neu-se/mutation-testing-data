  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a different argument, potentially returning a different country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a different argument, potentially returning a different country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a different argument, potentially returning a different country.

DONE.
