 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the actual implementation of `array_slice`, but using an array literal creates a new function scope, which may cause issues if `array_slice` is defined in the parent scope and relies on variables from that scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.slice
