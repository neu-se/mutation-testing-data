  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a method that is used to call a Node-style function with a given array of arguments, whereas `fapply` is a method that is used to call a function with a given array of arguments. Using `nfapply` instead of `fapply` would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is a method that is used to call a Node-style function with a given set of arguments, whereas `fapply` is a method that is used to call a function with a given array of arguments. Using `nfcall` instead of `fapply` would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
