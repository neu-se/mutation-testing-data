  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified, which could change the output of the `prop` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified, which could change the output of the `prop` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified, which could change the output of the `prop` function.

DONE.
