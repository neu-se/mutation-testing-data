  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same as the original code, which would not trigger the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.length}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different from the original code, which would trigger the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.length + 1}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different from the original code, which would trigger the desired behavior.

DONE.
