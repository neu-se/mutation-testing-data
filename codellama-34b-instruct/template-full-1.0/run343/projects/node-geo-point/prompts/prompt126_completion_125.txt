  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `this` keyword, and would cause a TypeError when attempting to access the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have a `calculateDistance` method, so it would throw a TypeError when attempting to invoke it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because `10` is a number and does not have a `calculateDistance` method, so it would throw a TypeError when attempting to invoke it.

DONE.
