  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes and returns the first element of the queue, whereas the original code fragment only accesses the first element without removing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the queue, whereas the original code fragment only accesses the first element without removing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the queue, whereas the original code fragment only accesses the first element without removing it.

DONE.
