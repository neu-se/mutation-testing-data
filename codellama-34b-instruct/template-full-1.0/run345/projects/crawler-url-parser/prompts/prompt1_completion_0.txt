  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%].test
```
This would result in different behavior because the dot (.) wildcard character is not escaped, which could cause issues with URLs that contain other characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\_\~\%]/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the i modifier is removed, which would cause the regular expression to be case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\w:]/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class only matches word characters and colons, whereas the original regular expression also matches other characters.

DONE.
