  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "q" is not a function and would cause an error when the code tries to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the function "noop" does nothing and would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "promise" is not a function and would cause an error when the code tries to call it.

DONE.
