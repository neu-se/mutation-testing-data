  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` variable is a function that returns a string, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression that is used to test the input word. Using `rule[1]` instead of `rule[0]` would cause the function to return a different value, which would result in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a string that is used as a replacement for the input word, whereas `rule[0]` and `rule[1]` are regular expressions and a function, respectively. Using `rule[2]` instead of `rule[0]` and `rule[1]` would cause the function to return a different value, which would result in a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This would result in
