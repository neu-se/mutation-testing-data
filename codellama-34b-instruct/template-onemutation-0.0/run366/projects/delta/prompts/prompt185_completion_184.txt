  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `otherOp.retain` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `otherOp.retain` is a string that contains a number.

DONE.
