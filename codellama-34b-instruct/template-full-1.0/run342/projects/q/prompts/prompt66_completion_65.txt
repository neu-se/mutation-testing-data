  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, `MessageChannel` is only considered if it is defined, while the replaced code fragment would consider it only if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, `MessageChannel` is only considered if it is a function, while the replaced code fragment would consider it only if it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, `MessageChannel` is only considered if it is an object, while the replaced code fragment would consider it only if it is not an object.

DONE.
