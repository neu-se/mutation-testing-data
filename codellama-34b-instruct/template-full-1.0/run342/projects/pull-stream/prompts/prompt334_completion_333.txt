  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return null, regardless of whether the input stream has ended or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return undefined, regardless of whether the input stream has ended or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the opposite of the `end` argument, regardless of whether the input stream has ended or not.

DONE.
