  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value !== null && typeof value === "object" && typeof value.then === "function";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` is an object with a `then` method, which is a more common check for a thenable object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value !== null && typeof value === "object" && value instanceof Promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` class, which is a more specific check for a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value !== null && typeof value === "object" && value[Symbol.toStringTag] === "Promise";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` has a `Symbol.toStringTag` property with the value "Promise", which is a more specific check for a promise object.

DONE.
