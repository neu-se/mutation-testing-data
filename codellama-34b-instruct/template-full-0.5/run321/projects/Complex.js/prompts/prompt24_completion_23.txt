  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * y` returns the product of `x` and `y`, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + y` returns the sum of `x` and `y`, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
