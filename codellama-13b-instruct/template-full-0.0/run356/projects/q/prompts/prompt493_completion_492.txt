  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "rejected" is not a valid JavaScript expression and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `rejected` function, and would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `null` is not a valid argument for the `rejected` function, and would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

DONE.
