  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var otherNext = otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called twice, which changes the state of the iterator and affects the behavior of the method calls that follow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next.call(this, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context is changed to `this`, which may affect the behavior of the method calls that follow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next = function() {
  return 1;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is replaced with a new function that always returns 1, which may affect the behavior of the method calls that follow.

DONE.
