  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` is a method that resumes the reading of data from the response stream, whereas `res.resume` is a property that indicates whether the reading of data from the response stream has been resumed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pause()` is a method that pauses the reading of data from the response stream, whereas `res.resume` is a property that indicates whether the reading of data from the response stream has been resumed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy()` is a method that destroys the response stream, whereas `res.resume` is a property that indicates whether the reading of data from the response stream has been resumed.

DONE.
