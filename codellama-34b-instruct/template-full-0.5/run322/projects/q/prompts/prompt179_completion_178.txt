  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that checks if a string is a substring of another string, whereas `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that searches a string for a match against a regular expression, whereas `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that searches a string for a match against a regular expression, whereas `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

DONE.
