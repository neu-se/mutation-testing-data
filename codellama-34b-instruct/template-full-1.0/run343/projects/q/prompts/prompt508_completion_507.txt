  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// code fragment
value.push(
```
This would result in different behavior because `.push` is a method of an array, but `value` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// code fragment
value.splice(
```
This would result in different behavior because `.splice` is a method that modifies an array, but `value` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// code fragment
value.delete(
```
This would result in different behavior because `.delete` is a method that removes a property from an object, but `value` is an array.

DONE.
