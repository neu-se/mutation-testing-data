  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now changes the plural form of "criteria" to "criterion", which is not the correct plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now always returns the singular form of "criterion", regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now changes the plural form of "criterion" to "criteria", which is not the correct plural form.

DONE.
