  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array with the elements starting from the specified index, whereas `args` is an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the specified value, whereas `args` is an array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` modifies the original array by adding the specified value at the end, whereas `args` is an array-like object.

DONE.
