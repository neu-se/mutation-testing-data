  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insertion, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not an insertion. This change would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the next operation is not an insertion.

DONE.
