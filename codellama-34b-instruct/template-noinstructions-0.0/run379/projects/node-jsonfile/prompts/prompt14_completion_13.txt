  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `shouldThrow` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `shouldThrow` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && typeof shouldThrow === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `shouldThrow` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is both truthy and a boolean value.

DONE.
