  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, but this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, but this new code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['re'] + z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, but this new code fragment checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
