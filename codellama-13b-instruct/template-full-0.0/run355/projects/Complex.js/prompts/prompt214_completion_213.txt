  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the `b` variable instead of using it as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the absolute value of the `b` variable instead of the variable itself.

DONE.
