Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used instead of `unescape`, which would change the way the URL is processed, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.replace(/%/g, '%25')
```
This would result in different behavior because it manually escapes the `%` character in the URL, which could lead to incorrect URL decoding and potentially cause issues with the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `url` variable is used instead of the `normalizedUrl` variable, which could lead to incorrect results if the `normalizedUrl` variable has been modified to handle specific edge cases.

DONE.
