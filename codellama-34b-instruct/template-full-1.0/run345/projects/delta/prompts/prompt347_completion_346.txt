  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `baseOpData` by 1, which may cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `baseOpData` by 1, which may cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `baseOpData` by 2, which may cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different result.

DONE.
