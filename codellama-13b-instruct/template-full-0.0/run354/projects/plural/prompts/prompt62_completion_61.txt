  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for pluralizing "bacterium" as "bacteria", while the buggy code fragment adds a rule for pluralizing "bacterium" as "bacteria" again, which would result in a duplicate rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for pluralizing "bacterium" as "bacteria", while the buggy code fragment adds two rules for pluralizing "bacterium" as "bacteria", which would result in a duplicate rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria
