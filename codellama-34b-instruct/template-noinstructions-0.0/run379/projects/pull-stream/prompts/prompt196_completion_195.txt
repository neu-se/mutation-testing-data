  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && !busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && !busy)`, which would always be false if `abort` is true and `busy` is false. In the original code, the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `!abort && busy`, which would be true if `abort` is false and `busy` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort || busy)`, which would always be true if `abort` is true or `busy` is true. In the original code, the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the
