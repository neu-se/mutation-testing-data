  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string that represents the type of the operand. In this case, `typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"` returns `true` if `StopIteration` is defined, and `false` otherwise. Therefore, replacing the `typeof` operator with a different one that always returns `true` would make the code fragment always evaluate to `true`, regardless of whether `StopIteration` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `StopIteration` is an identifier and not a keyword. If the `typeof` operator is replaced with a different one that always returns `true`, the code fragment would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of whether `StopIteration` is defined. However, if the `typeof` operator is replaced with a different one that always returns `false`, the code fragment would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of whether `StopIteration` is
