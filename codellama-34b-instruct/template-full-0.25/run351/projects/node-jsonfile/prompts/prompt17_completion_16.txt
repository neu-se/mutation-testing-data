  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `typeof` checks the type of a value. In this case, `options` is an object, so `instanceof String` would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.constructor === String
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object, while `typeof` checks the type of a value. In this case, `options.constructor` would always be `Object`, so the condition would always be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() === '[object String]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` returns a string representation of an object, while `typeof` checks the type of a value. In this case, `options.toString()` would always be `'[object Object]
