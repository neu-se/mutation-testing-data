  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to be evaluated as a property on the string object, rather than a function call. The resulting error would be different from the original behavior, which was to call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function and pass it the `stackLine` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.bind(null, stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to be called as a method on the string object, rather than a function call. The resulting error would be different from the original behavior, which was to call `getFileNameAndLineNumber` as a regular function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to be evaluated as a string, rather
