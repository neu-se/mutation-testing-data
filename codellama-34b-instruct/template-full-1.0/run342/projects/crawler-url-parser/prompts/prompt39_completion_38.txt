  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line checks if the protocol is not equal to both "http:" and "https:", while this version only checks if it is not equal to "http:", which would result in a different branching behavior for URLs that have a protocol other than "http:".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol == 'http:' || parsedUrl.protocol == 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line checks if the protocol is both "http:" and "https:", while this version checks if it is only one of them, which would result in a different branching behavior for URLs that have a protocol of "http:".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol

This would result in different behavior because the original line checks if the protocol is not equal to "http:" or
