  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[false, true]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `post` method to return a rejected promise with the value `false` instead of a resolved promise with the value `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `post` method to return a resolved promise with the value `null` instead of a resolved promise with the value `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined, NaN]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `post` method to return a resolved promise with the value `undefined` instead of a resolved promise with the value `true`.

DONE.
