  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, and the `ret.baseurl` property would be set to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, and the `ret.baseurl` property would be set to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, and the `ret.baseurl` property would be set to `undefined`.

DONE.
