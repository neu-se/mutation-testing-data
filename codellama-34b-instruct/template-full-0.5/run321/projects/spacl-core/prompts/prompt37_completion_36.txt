  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is not being called on the array, which would cause the `part` variable to be assigned the first element of the array instead of the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being called on the array with an argument of `1`, which would cause the array to be reversed in-place and then the first element would be assigned to the `part` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being called on the array with an argument of `0
