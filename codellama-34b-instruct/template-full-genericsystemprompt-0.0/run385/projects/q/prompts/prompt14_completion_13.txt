  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is a function that returns `false`, whereas `ses.ok` is a function that returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is a function that returns `false`, whereas `ses.ok` is a function that returns `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk(true)` is a function that returns `false`, whereas `ses.ok` is a function that returns `true`.

DONE.
