  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this replacement checks if the value is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this replacement checks if the value is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this replacement checks if the value is falsy.

DONE.
