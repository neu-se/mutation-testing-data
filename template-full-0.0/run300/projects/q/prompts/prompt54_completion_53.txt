  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object, while `process.toString` is a string that represents the `process` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString.call()` is a function that calls the `toString` method on the `process` object, while `process.toString` is a string that represents the `process` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString.apply()` is a function that applies the `toString` method on the `process` object, while `process.toString` is a string that represents the `process` object.

DONE.
