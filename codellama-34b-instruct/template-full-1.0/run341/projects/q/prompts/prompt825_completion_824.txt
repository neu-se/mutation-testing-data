  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `Q.reject()` will cause the promise to reject, whereas the original code fragment `promise` will cause the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `Q.resolve()` will cause the promise to resolve, whereas the original code fragment `promise` will cause the promise to reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `Q.fcall()` will cause the promise to resolve immediately, whereas the original code fragment `promise` will cause the promise to resolve only after a delay.

DONE.
