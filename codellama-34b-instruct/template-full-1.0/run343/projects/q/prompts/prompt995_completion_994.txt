  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in a TypeError as null does not have a "push" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in a TypeError as "this" is not an Array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in a TypeError as "pop" expects the argument to be a number, not a function.

DONE.
