  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would push the callback to the array of callbacks, while this mutated code would push the callback to the array only if the array length is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb) && cbs.push(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would push the callback to the array of callbacks, while this mutated code would push the callback to the array only if it doesn't already exist in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(cbs.indexOf(cb) + 1).push(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would push the callback to the end of the array of callbacks, while this mutated code would push the callback after the last occurrence of the same callback in the array.
