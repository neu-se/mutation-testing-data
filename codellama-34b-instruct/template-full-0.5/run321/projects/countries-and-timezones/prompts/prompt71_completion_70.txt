  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with the `name` variable, which is not the same as the original code that called the function with the `data` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with the `name` variable, which is not the same as the original code that called the function with the `data` variable.
