  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to be called instead of the `sin` function, which will result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `tan` function to be called instead of the `sin` function, which will result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This change will cause the `asin` function to be called instead of the `sin` function, which will result in a different output.

DONE.
