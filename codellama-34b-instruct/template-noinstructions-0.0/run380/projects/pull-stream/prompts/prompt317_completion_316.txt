  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of the return value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(null, null)` would be called regardless of the return value of `test`. Additionally, the new code fragment would pass `null` as the second argument to the `cb` function, which would be different from the original code fragment that passed `data` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('test failed'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be
