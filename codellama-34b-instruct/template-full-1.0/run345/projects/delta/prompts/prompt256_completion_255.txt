  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` method is called on `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, which would always return `true` since `true` is being passed as an argument. This would cause the `retain` function to be called every time, regardless of whether the two objects are equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` method is called on `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, which would always return `false` since `false` is being passed as an argument. This would cause the `retain` function to never be called, regardless of whether the two objects are equal or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEmpty(otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEmpty` method is called on `otherOp.insert` which would return `true` if
