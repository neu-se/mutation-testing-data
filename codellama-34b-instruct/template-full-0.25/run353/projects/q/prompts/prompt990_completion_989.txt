  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, while `null` is a scalar value and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, while `undefined` is a scalar value and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, while `[]` is an empty array and would cause a different behavior.

DONE.
