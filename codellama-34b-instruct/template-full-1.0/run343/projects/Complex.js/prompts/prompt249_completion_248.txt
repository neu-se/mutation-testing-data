  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different mathematical expression than `a`. In the original code, `a` is used as the base of the exponential function, which means that the resulting value will be `e^(a+b)`. In the mutated code, `a+b` is used as the base, which will result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is a different mathematical expression than `a`. In the original code, `a` is used as the base of the exponential function, which means that the resulting value will be `e^(a-b)`. In the mutated code, `a-b` is used as the base, which will result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a different
