  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the error "rejected" instead of being resolved with the value "reject".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the error "rejected" instead of being resolved with the value "reject".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("rejected")).promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the error "rejected" instead of being resolved with the value "reject".

DONE.
