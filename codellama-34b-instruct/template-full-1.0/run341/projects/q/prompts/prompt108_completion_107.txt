  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` twice in one iteration, potentially causing the loop to skip certain iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to its current value plus 2 instead of incrementing it by 1, potentially causing the loop to skip certain iterations.

DONE.
