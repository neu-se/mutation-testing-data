  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object as its argument, but `null` is not an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object as its argument, but `undefined` is not an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object as its argument, and `new Error()` creates a new error object that is not the same as the original error object.

DONE.
