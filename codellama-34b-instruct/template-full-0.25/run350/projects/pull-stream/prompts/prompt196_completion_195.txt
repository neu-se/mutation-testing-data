  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if `abort` is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator subtracts 1 from the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if `abort` is less than 1.

DONE.
