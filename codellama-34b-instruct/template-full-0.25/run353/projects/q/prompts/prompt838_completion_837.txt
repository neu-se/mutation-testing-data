  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the rejection reason as its argument, even if the rejection is handled by a `catch` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function () {
    throw new Error("Unhandled rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would be executed if the promise is rejected, regardless of whether the rejection is handled by a `catch` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function (reason) {
    if (reason instanceof Error) {
        throw reason;
    } else {
        throw new Error("Unhandled rejection: " + reason);
    }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would be executed
