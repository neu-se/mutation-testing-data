  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalise` is a function that returns a string, but `finalise()` calls the function and returns the result, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalise.call(this)` calls the `finalise` function with `this` as the context, which is the `Matcher` instance. This means that the function will have access to the instance's properties and methods, which may not be the case with `finalise()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise.bind(this)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalise.bind(this)()` calls the `finalise` function with `this` as the context, and then immediately calls the resulting function with no arguments. This is similar to `finalise.call(this)`, but it also immediately calls the
