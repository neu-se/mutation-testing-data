  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the value of `length` instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more character than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: -length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete a negative number of characters, which would have the opposite effect of the original code.

DONE.
