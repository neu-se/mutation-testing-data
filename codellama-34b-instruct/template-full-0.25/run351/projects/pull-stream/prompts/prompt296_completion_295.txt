  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the function to terminate early if `ended` is true, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to terminate early if `ended` is true, but only if `end` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to terminate early if both `ended` and `end` are true.

DONE.
