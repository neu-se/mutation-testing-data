  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if the promise has been resolved. In the original code, `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and it would only evaluate to `true` if it has been resolved.

DONE.
