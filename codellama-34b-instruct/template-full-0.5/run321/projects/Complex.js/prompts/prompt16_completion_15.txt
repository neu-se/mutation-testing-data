  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `-a` returns the negative of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `a*a` returns the square of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `a+1` returns the sum of a number and 1.

DONE.
