  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "die" as "dice", while this new code fragment adds it as "dies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'die')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "die" as "dice", while this new code fragment does not add a plural form for the word "die".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "die" as "dice", while this new code fragment adds it as "dice" again, resulting in a duplicate rule.

DONE.
