  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the calling code.

DONE.
