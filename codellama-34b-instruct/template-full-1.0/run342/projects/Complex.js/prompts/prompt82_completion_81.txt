  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c != 'i' && c != 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `c` is equal to `'i'` or `'I'`, while this replacement code fragment checks if it is not equal to either of those values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'i'` or `'I'`, while this replacement code fragment only checks if it is equal to `'I'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'i'` or `'I'`, while this replacement code fragment always returns `false`.

DONE.
