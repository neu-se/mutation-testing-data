  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the result of `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the function call was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the result of `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the function call, even if the function call failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(function (result) {
    deferred.resolve(result);
}).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the result of `f
