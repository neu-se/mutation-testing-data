Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the `closed` promise as resolved immediately, which means that any subsequent calls to `get` will not be able to resolve the promise correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve values from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the `closed` promise with `null`, which may lead to confusion in the promise resolution process, potentially causing the queue to behave incorrectly when it is closed, as it would not properly handle the error state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the `closed` promise with a boolean value `false`, which is not a valid state for a promise and could lead to incorrect handling of the closed state of the queue, causing the queue to behave as if it is still open when it should be closed.

DONE.
