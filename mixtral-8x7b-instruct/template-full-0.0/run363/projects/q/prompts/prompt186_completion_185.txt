 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the non-greedy match `?:\d+` is removed, which may cause the regular expression to match a different part of the stack trace line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the last `?:\d+` is changed to `\d+`, which would require the column number to be present in the stack trace line and match it exactly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at ([^:]+):(\d+):.*$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the last non-capturing group `(?:\d+)` is changed to `.*`, which would match any character (except for a newline) 0 or more
