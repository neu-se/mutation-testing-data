  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` is a function that takes an argument, but it is not called with any arguments in the original code. Therefore, replacing `once` with `onEnd` would cause the function to be called with no arguments, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd(null)` is a function call with a null argument, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd(true)` is a function call with a boolean argument, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
