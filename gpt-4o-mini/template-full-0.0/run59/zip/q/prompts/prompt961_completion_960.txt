Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected number of arguments from 0 to 1, which could lead to incorrect function calls and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index from 0 to -1, which may cause the function to behave incorrectly by attempting to access an invalid index in the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the current promise to the `thisp` variable, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if `thisp` is not the intended context for the function being bound.

DONE.
