  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `baseOpData` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array, whereas `baseOpData` is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the original array, whereas `baseOpData` is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
