  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This code fragment is different from the original `x === y` in that it uses the `!==` operator instead of `===`. This means that the code will only be executed if `x` and `y` are not equal, rather than if they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This code fragment is different from the original `x === y` in that it uses the `==` operator instead of `===`. This means that the code will only be executed if `x` and `y` are equal, but it will also be executed if they are both `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x != y
```
This code fragment is different from the original `x === y` in that it uses the `!=` operator instead of `===`. This means that the code will only be executed if `x` and `y` are not equal, rather than if they are
