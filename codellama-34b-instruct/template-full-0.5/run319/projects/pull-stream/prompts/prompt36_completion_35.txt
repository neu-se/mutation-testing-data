  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the third element of the `ref` array instead of the second element, which could cause the function to behave differently if the array has less than four elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `ref` array instead of the second element, which could cause the function to behave differently if the array has a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the `pull` function instead of the second element of the `ref` array, which could cause the function to behave differently if the array has a null value.

DONE.
