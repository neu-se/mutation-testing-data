  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the baseOp, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the attributes of the baseOp, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compose the attributes of the baseOp, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
