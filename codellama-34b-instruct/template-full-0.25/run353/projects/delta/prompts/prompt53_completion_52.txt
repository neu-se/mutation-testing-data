  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is equal to `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!handler || handler.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is falsy or if it has a length of 0.

DONE.
