  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `b` to calculate the `cosh` function, while the new code uses the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `b` to calculate the `cosh` function, while the new code uses the value of `b + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `b` to calculate the `cosh` function, while the new code uses the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
