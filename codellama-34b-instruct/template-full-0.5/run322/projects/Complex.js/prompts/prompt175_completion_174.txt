  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for negative values of c, while the original code would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false for negative values of c, while the original code would return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) > Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for negative values of c, while the original code would return false.

DONE.
