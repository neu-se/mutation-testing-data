  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `reason` object instead of the `rejection` object, which could cause issues in the code that uses the `rejection` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason, rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `rejection` object instead of the `reason` object, which could cause issues in the code that uses the `reason` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `rejection` object instead of the actual rejection object, which could cause issues in the code that uses the `rejection` object.

DONE.
