  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operator would cause the next operation to retain the specified number of characters, rather than deleting them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would cause the next operation to delete one less character than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operator would cause the next operation to insert the specified number of characters, rather than deleting them.

DONE.
