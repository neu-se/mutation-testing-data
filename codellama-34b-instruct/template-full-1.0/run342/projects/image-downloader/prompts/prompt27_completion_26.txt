  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator will remove the `options` object, rather than passing it to the `request` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.something = 'wrong value'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `something` property is being set to the wrong value, which could cause the `request` function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.something()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `something` property is being called as a function, rather than being passed as an argument to the `request` function.

DONE.
