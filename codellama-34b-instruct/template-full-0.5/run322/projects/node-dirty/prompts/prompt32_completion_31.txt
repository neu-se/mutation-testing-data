  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `key` variable, which is a string. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `set` method to throw an error when trying to access the `key` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `key` variable, which is a string. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `set` method to throw an error when trying to access the `key` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `key` variable, which is a string. Replacing it with an empty string would cause the `set` method to throw an error when trying to access the `key` property of an empty string.

DONE.
