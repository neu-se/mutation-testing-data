 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the second key of the object `b`, which might not exist, causing an error. The original code fragment `b` simply refers to the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the object `b` with an empty object. The original code fragment `b` retains the original object, and the comparison is done based on the values of the shared keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>b).nonexistentKey
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access a nonexistent key of the object `b`, causing an error. The original code fragment `b` simply refers to the object itself.

DONE.
