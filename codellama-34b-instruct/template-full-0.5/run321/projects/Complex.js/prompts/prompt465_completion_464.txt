  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator changes the sign of the variable, which can affect the result of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a number, so the comparison would return false, even if the actual value of b is less than Complex['EPSILON'].

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 changes the value of the variable, which can affect the result of the comparison.

DONE.
