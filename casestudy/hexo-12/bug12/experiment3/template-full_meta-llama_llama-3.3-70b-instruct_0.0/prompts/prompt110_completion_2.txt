Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `+` operator to convert `data.slug` to a string, which may not be equivalent to calling `toString()` explicitly, especially if `data.slug` is not a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String(data.slug)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `String()` function to convert `data.slug` to a string, which may handle certain edge cases differently than calling `toString()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'' + data.slug
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `+` operator with an empty string to convert `data.slug` to a string, which may have different performance characteristics or behavior for certain types of values, compared to calling `toString()`.

DONE.
