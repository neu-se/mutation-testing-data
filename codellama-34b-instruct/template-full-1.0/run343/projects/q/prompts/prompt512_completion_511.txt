  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_keys[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first object key instead of all object keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all the object keys as an array, whereas the original code returns a getter function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty string instead of all object keys.

DONE.
