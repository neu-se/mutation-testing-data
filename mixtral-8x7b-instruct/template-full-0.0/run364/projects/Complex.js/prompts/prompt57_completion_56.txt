 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'r' of a && 'phi' of a
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `of` keyword instead of `in`, which would always evaluate to `false` since `a` is not an object with `r` and `phi` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'r' in arguments && 'phi' in arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `r` and `phi` properties in the `arguments` object, which would always evaluate to `false` since `arguments` does not have those properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'r' in window && 'phi' in window
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `r` and `phi` properties in the `window` object, which would always evaluate to `false` since `window` does not have those properties.

DONE
