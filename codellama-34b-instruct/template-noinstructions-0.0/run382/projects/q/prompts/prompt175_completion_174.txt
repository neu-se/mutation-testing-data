  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the elements of the `desiredLines` array into a single string, rather than joining them with newline characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the elements of the `desiredLines` array into a single string, separated by spaces, rather than newline characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.join("\t")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the elements of the `desiredLines` array into a single string, separated by tabs, rather than newline characters.

DONE.
