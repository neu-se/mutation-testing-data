  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.nextTick()` function would be called immediately instead of being passed as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout()` function would schedule the `flush()` function to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than calling it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestAnimationFrame()` function would schedule the `flush()` function to be called at the beginning of the next animation frame, rather than calling it immediately.

DONE.
