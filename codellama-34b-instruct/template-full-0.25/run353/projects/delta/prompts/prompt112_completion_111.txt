  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = 'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `insert` property was a string, but this replacement code fragment would always set `insert` to the string `'hello'`, regardless of its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `insert` property was a string, but this replacement code fragment would always set `insert` to `null`, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `insert` property was a string, but this replacement code fragment would always set `insert` to `undefined`, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
