  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends` is a deferred object, and resolving it would cause the `get` method to return a promise that is not the same as the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a deferred object, and resolving it would cause the `get` method to return a promise that is not the same as the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(error)` is a rejected promise, and resolving it would cause the `get` method to return a promise that is not the same as the original promise.

DONE.
