  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/:.:/) !== null
```
This would result in a different outcome because the original code fragment checks if the spec variable contains a colon or a slash, while the new code fragment checks if the spec variable contains two adjacent colons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/:$/) !== null
```
This would result in a different outcome because the original code fragment checks if the spec variable contains a colon or a slash, while the new code fragment checks if the spec variable ends with a colon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/(:._)/) !== null
```
This would result in a different outcome because the original code fragment checks if the spec variable contains a colon or a slash, while the new code fragment checks if the spec variable contains a colon followed by any character.

DONE.
