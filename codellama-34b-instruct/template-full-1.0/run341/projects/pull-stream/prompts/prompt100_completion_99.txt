  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, if `cb` is called with `null`, it means that the `find` function did not find any matching data, and it will return `false`. However, if `cb` is called with `undefined`, it means that the function was not able to find any matching data, but it will return `true`, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is a falsy value, and `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, if `cb` is called with `null`, it means that the `find` function did not find any matching data, and it will return `false`. However, if `cb` is called with `''`, it means that the function was not able to find any matching data, but it will return `true`, which may cause
