  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
global.Q = definition();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not create a new Q object, but rather assign the existing global Q object to a new variable, and then reassign the global Q object to the newly defined object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
global.Q = definition();
global.Q = previousQ;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the global Q object to the previous value, effectively undoing the assignment of the newly defined object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
global.Q = definition();
global.Q = previousQ;
global.Q = definition();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the global Q object to the previous value, and then reassign it to the newly defined object, effectively creating a new Q object and then
