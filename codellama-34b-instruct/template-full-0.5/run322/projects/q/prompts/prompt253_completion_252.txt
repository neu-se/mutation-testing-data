  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and therefore would cause an error when trying to call `promiseDispatch` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and therefore would cause an error when trying to call `promiseDispatch` on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("invalid promise"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error, rather than resolving it with the original value.

DONE.
