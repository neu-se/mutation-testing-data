  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the wrong reason from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two reasons from the `unhandledReasons` array instead of one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove no reasons from the `unhandledReasons` array instead of one.

DONE.
