  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because !isEqual is a negation of isEqual, which means that the code would consider two objects as equal if they are not equal, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because isNotEqual is a negation of isEqual, which means that the code would consider two objects as equal if they are not equal, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
===
```
This would result in different behavior because === checks for strict equality, which means that the code would consider two objects as equal only if they are the same object, and not if they have the same properties and values.

DONE.
