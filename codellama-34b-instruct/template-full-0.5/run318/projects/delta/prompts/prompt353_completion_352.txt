  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument for the `chop` method, while this modified code fragment includes an argument of `1`, which would cause the `chop` method to remove the first element of the `inverted` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument for the `chop` method, while this modified code fragment includes an argument of `2`, which would cause the `chop` method to remove the first two elements of the `inverted` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument for the `chop` method, while this modified code fragment includes an argument of `-1`,
