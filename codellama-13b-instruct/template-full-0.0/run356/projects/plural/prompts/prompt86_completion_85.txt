  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'people')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "people", while the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "person".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'person')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "people", while the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "person".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'persons')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "people", while the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "persons".
