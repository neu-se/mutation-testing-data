  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will return the opposite Boolean value of `shouldThrow`. The `if` block will be entered when `shouldThrow` is `false`, and the `else` block will be entered when `shouldThrow` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will return the opposite Boolean value of `options.throws`. The `if` block will be entered when `options.throws` is `false`, and the `else` block will be entered when `options.throws` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof shouldThrow === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator will always return `'boolean'` for a Boolean value, but it can also return `'string'` if the value is a string. The `if` block will be
