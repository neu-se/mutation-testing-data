  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text != text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict inequality instead of checking for text inclusion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text === text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality instead of checking for text inclusion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for text inclusion from the start of the string instead of anywhere in the string.

DONE.
