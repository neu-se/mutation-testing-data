 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will throw an error when the `fapply` method tries to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a method that immediately resolves the deferred object, bypassing the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
