  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\` character to match the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `/` character to match the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\\` character to match the beginning of the string.

DONE.
