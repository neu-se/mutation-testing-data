  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument `0` would cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to return a different result, which would then be passed to the `JSON.parse` function as the `reviver` argument, which could potentially result in a different parse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument `null` would cause the `JSON.parse` function to return a different result, which would then be passed to the `universalify.fromCallback` function as the `callback` argument, which could potentially result in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument `true` would cause the `JSON.parse` function to return a different result, which would then be passed to the `universalify.fromCallback` function
