  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the `!` operator applied to `this._waitForDrain`, which has the opposite effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._waitForDrain
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the `&&` operator replaced with `||`, which changes the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size || !this._waitForDrain
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the `!` operator applied to `this._waitForDrain`, which has the opposite effect.

DONE.
