  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `gzip` option to be `true`, even if it was set to `false` in the original code. This could cause the archive to be created with gzip compression, even if the user did not want it to be compressed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { store: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `store` option to be `true`, even if it was set to `false` in the original code. This could cause the archive to be created without compression, even if the user wanted it to be compressed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `zlib` option to have a compression level of 9,
