  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would not be called, leading to an unhandled rejection instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would not be called with an argument, leading to an unhandled rejection with a null error instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would not be called with an argument, leading to an unhandled rejection with the promise itself instead.

DONE.
