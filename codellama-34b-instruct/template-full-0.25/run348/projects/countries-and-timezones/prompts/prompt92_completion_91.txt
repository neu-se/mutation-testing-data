  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_country_id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getCountry` would return `null` instead of a country object, as the input country ID is invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getCountry` would return a different country object, as the input country ID is incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getCountry` would return a different country object, as the input country ID is multiplied by 2.

DONE.
