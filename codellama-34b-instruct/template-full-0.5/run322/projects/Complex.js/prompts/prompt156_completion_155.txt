  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

DONE.
