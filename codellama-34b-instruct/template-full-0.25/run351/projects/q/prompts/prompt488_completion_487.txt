  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called twice, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the array without actually removing any elements, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, unhandledRejections.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the array, which could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
