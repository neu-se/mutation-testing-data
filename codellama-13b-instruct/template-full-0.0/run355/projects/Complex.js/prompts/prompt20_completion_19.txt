  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 || b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000, while the new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is less than 3000. This could potentially cause the function to return different results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b < 3000 && a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000, while the new code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000 and not equal to each other. This could potentially cause the function to return different results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b
