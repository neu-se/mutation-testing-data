  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(onAbort, abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `abortCb` would be reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `abortCb` would be passed in a different order, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` argument would be missing, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
