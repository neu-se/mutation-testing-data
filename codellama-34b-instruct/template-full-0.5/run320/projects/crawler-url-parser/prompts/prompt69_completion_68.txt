  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to be called with a hardcoded URL, rather than using the `sourceUrl` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to be called with a null value, rather than using the `sourceUrl` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to be called with an empty string, rather than using the `sourceUrl` variable.

DONE.
