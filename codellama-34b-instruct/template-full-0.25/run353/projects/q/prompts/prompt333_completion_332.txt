  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, which is a promise. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `then` method to return `null` instead of a promise, which could break the code that relies on the promise being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, which is a promise. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `then` method to return `undefined` instead of a promise, which could break the code that relies on the promise being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, which is a promise. Rep
