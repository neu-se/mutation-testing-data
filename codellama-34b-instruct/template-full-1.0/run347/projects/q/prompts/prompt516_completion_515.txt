  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a reserved word in JavaScript, and using it as a property name would throw a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["catch"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a reserved word in JavaScript, and using it as a property name would throw a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function (error))
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` takes two arguments, a fulfillment callback and a rejection callback. Passing `null` as the fulfillment callback makes the resulting promise resolve with a value of `undefined` instead of the original promise value.

DONE.
