  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```var myObject = {x: 1, y: 2};
stackLine.split("@");
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.split("@")` would return an array with two elements, whereas the original code would return a string representing the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```stackLine.replace(/@/g, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.replace(/@/g, "")` would replace all occurrences of "@" in the stack trace with an empty string, whereas the original code would only replace the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```stackLine.split("```");
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.split(""`")` would split the stack trace into an array of strings using "`" as the separator, whereas the original code would split the stack trace into an array of strings using "@".

DONE.
