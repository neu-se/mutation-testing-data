  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the case of the characters in the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the input as multiple lines, allowing the pattern to match across line boundaries.

DONE.
