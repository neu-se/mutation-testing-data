 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0 as the length of the next operation, which may cause the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(thisIter.current())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the current operation as the length of the next operation, which may cause the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number as the length of the next operation, which may cause the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
