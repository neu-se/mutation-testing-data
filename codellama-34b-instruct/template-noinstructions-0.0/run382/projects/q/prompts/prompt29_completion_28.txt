  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length` expression would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to run one extra iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length` expression would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to run one fewer iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length` expression would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the loop to run twice as many iterations.

DONE.
