  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for an object or null, but this replacement code checks for a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for an object or null, but this replacement code uses the instanceof operator to check for any object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for an object or null, but this replacement code checks for an object that is not an empty object.

DONE.
