  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.toString()` returns a string representation of the `baseUrl` object, whereas `baseUrl` returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.href` returns the URL of the `baseUrl` object, whereas `baseUrl` returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.origin
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.origin` returns the origin of the `baseUrl` object, whereas `baseUrl` returns the object itself.

DONE.
