  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different method than `reject`, and it would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a different method than `reject`, and it would cause the promise to notify progress instead of reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is a different method than `reject`, and it would cause the promise to create a Node-style callback instead of reject.

DONE.
