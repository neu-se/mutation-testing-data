  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` returns a new promise, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(true)` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately with the value `true`, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(false)` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately with the value `false`, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
