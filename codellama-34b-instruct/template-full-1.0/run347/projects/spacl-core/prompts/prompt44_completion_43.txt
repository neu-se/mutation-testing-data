  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = '++';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator will increment the value of `part` by 1, whereas the original code fragment would have left `part` unchanged and searched for the literal value `'++'` in the `spec` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = '/';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator will divide the value of `part` by 1, whereas the original code fragment would have left `part` unchanged and searched for the literal value `'/'` in the `spec` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = '+';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used for both string concatenation and arithmetic addition, and the context is unclear from the surrounding code, so it could result in either concatenating the value of `part` with an empty string or adding the value of `part` to
