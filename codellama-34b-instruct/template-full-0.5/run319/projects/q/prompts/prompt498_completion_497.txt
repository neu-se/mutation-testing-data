  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `reason` argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which is used to track unhandled rejections. By replacing it with `null`, the function will not receive the `reason` argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `rejection` argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which is used to track unhandled rejections. By replacing it with `undefined`, the function will not receive the `rejection` argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, "different reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `reason` argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which is used to track unhandled rejections
