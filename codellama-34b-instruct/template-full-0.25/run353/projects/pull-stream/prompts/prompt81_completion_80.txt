  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err === true` would only check if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, whereas the original code fragment `function' == typeof err` would check if the type of `err` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err == true` would check if `err` is equal to `true`, but would not check the type of `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof err === 'function'` would check if the type of `err` is a function, but would not check if `err` is strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
