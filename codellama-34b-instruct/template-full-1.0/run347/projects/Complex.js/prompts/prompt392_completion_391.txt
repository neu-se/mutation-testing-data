  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b`, which could change the result of the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `b`, which could change the result of the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `b`, which could change the result of the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

DONE.
