  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array may be empty or contain more than one element, leading to a different outcome when only the first element is accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `args` array, leading to a different outcome when the function is called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `args` array instead of the first element, leading to a different outcome when the function is called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
