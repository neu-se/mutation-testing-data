  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.d
```
This would result in different behavior because `.d` is not a valid property of the `timezone` object, so it would return `undefined` instead of the expected offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.getOffsetStr(tz.d)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getOffsetStr()` takes a single argument, but `timezone.d` would be passed as two arguments (the timezone object and the "d" property) which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (tz.d) {
  result.aliasOf = aliasOf;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `aliasOf` property of the `result` object to the value of the `aliasOf` property of the `tz` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
