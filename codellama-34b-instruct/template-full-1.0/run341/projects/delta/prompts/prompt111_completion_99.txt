  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, using `pop()` would cause the `ops` array to be altered, potentially leading to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.splice(index, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` inserts a new element into the array at a specific index, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, using `splice()` with a specific index would cause the `ops` array to be altered, potentially leading to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array.
