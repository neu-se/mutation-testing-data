  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `done` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise has already been resolved.

DONE.
