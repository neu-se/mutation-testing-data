  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("orost", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject)

This would result in the promise rejection described in the bug report, even when the expected exception is not raised, because it correctly identifies the problem in the original code: the method for dispatching the `post` event is called incorrectly, with an incorrect event type and no callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).orost(deferred.reject)

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).dost(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in the promise never being rejected, even when the expected exception is raised, and the promise always resolving to `undefined`, because it
