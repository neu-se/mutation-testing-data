  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stringify` returns a string, while `null` is a null value and would cause an error if used in the same context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stringify` returns a string, while `undefined` is a value that is not defined and would cause an error if used in the same context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stringify` returns a string, while `"foo"` is a string literal that would cause the `JSON.parse` method to fail if used in the same context.

DONE.
