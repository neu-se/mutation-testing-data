  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` would result in a different value than `1 + 2 * b` for certain inputs, such as `b = -1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` would result in a different value than `2 * b + 1` for certain inputs, such as `b = -1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` would result in a different value than `2 * b - 1` for certain inputs, such as `b = -1`.

DONE.
