  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the given number of elements from the array, whereas `push` is a method that adds new elements to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that adds and/or removes elements from an array, whereas `push` only adds new elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is a method that adds new elements to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds new elements to the end of an array.

DONE.
