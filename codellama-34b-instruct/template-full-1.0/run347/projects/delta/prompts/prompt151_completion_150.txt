  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from subtraction to addition, which would cause the value of `firstOther.retain` to increase rather than decrease.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from addition to subtraction, which would cause the value of `firstOther.delete` to decrease rather than increase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs()` function is used to get the absolute value of the difference between `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft`, which would cause the resulting value to always be positive, even if `firstOther.retain` is less than `firstLeft`.

DONE.
