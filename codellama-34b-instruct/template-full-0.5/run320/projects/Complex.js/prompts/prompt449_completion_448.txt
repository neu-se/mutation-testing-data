  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by the number of places, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, instead of multiplying it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number by a negative number, effectively changing the sign of the result.

DONE.
