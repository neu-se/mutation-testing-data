  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path segment from the URL, while the replaced code fragment removes any trailing slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path segment from the URL, while the replaced code fragment escapes the last path segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path segment from the URL, while the replaced code fragment escapes the last path segment.

DONE.
