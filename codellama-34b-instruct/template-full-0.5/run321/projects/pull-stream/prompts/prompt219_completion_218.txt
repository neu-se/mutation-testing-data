  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` passes `null` as the first argument to the `cb` function, while this new code fragment passes `data` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` passes `aborted` as the first argument to the `cb` function, while this new code fragment passes `aborted` as the first argument to the `abortCb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` passes `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument to the `cb` function, while this new code fragment passes `err` as the first argument and `data`
