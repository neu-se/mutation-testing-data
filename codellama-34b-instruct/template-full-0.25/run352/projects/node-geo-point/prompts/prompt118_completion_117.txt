  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would be using a different distance value than the original code, which could lead to a different destination point being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would be using a distance value that is 100 meters greater than the original code, which could lead to a different destination point being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would be using a distance value that is half of the original code, which could lead to a different destination point being calculated.

DONE.
