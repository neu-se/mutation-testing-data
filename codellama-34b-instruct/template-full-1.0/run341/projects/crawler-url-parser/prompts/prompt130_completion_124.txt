  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.hostname` would provide the hostname of the URL without the protocol or port, while `pageurl` would provide the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.href` would provide the entire URL, including the protocol, hostname, and port, while `pageurl` would provide the domain name only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.pathname` would provide the pathname of the URL without the protocol or hostname, while `pageurl` would provide the entire URL.

DONE.
