Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a delay of 1000 milliseconds before executing the `flush` function, which could lead to tasks being executed much later than intended, potentially causing issues with task ordering and timing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() { console.log('Flushing...'); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the call to `flush` with a logging statement, preventing any tasks from being executed, which could lead to tasks being indefinitely queued without being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because setting a negative timeout is effectively treated as a zero timeout in most environments, but it could lead to unexpected behavior in some implementations, potentially causing the `flush` function to be skipped or executed in an unintended manner.

DONE.
