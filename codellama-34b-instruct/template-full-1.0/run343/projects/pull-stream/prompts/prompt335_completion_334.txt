  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the function to return a value, but `null` is a primitive value and does not have any properties or methods that can be accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the function to return a value, but `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have any properties or methods that can be accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the function to return a value, but `false` is a boolean value and does not have any properties or methods that can be accessed.

DONE.
