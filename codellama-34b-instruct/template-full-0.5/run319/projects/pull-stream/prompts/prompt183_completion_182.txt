  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses a less than or equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently when the length of the array is zero or when the index is equal to the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses a less than operator. This would cause the code to behave differently when the length of the array is zero or when the index is equal to the length of the array minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses a less than or equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently when the index is
