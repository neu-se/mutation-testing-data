  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `d` variable is used in the `Math.abs()` function, which returns the absolute value of a number. By adding 1 to `d`, the absolute value of the result would be different, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `d` variable is used in the `Math.abs()` function, which returns the absolute value of a number. By multiplying `d` by 2, the absolute value of the result would be different, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `d` variable is used in the `Math.abs()` function, which returns the absolute value of a number. By subtracting 1 from `d
