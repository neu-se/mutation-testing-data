  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` expression would increment the `i` variable by 1, whereas the original `i` expression would not modify the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i - 1` expression would decrement the `i` variable by 1, whereas the original `i` expression would not modify the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i * 2` expression would multiply the `i` variable by 2, whereas the original `i` expression would not modify the variable.

DONE.
