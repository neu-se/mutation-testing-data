  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `prop` function, causing the `map` function to receive a different input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the result of the `prop` function, causing the `map` function to receive a different input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the result of the `prop` function, causing the `map` function to receive a different input.

DONE.
