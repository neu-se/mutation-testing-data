  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve immediately, instead of after a delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject immediately, instead of after a delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to never timeout, and instead would resolve or reject immediately depending on the outcome of the previous promise.

DONE.
