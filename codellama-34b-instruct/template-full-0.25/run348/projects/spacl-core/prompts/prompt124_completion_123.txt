  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match === null` checks for a null match, while `match === undefined` checks for an undefined match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match !== null` checks for a non-null match, while `match === null` checks for a null match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match !== undefined` checks for a non-undefined match, while `match === undefined` checks for an undefined match.

DONE.
