  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first one, whereas `arguments` itself is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except the last one, whereas `arguments` itself is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)` would return a new array containing all elements
