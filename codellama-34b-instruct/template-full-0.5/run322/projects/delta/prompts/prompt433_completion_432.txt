  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length to be incremented by 1, which could cause the iterator to miss the next operation if it has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length to be decremented by 1, which could cause the iterator to skip the previous operation if it has a length of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length to be doubled, which could cause the iterator to miss the next operation if it has a length of 1.

DONE.
