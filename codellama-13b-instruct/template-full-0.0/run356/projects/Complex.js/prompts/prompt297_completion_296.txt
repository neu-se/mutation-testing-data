  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sinh` function, which computes the hyperbolic sine, while the modified code fragment uses the `sin` function, which computes the regular sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cosh` function, which computes the hyperbolic cosine, while the modified code fragment uses the `cos` function, which computes the regular cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `tanh` function, which computes the hyperbolic tangent, while the modified code fragment uses the `tan` function, which computes the regular tangent.

DONE.
