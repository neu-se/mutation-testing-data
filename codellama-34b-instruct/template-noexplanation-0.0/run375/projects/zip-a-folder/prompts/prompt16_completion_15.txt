  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the bitwise OR operator to combine the `R_OK` and `W_OK` constants, which is not necessary in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the bitwise AND operator to combine the `R_OK` and `W_OK` constants, which is not necessary in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the
