  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` would cause the promise to be notified, rather than resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined`, rather than the expected value.

DONE.
