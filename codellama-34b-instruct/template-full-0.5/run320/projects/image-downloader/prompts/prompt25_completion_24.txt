  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(process.cwd(), options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory, which may not be the same as the directory containing the script.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(path.dirname(options.dest), options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.join()` joins two paths together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(__dirname, options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `__dirname` is the directory name of the current script, whereas `path.join()` joins two paths together.

DONE.
