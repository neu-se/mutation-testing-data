  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value from the first point instead of the second point, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value from the first point instead of the second point, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
