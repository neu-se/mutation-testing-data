  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the operation by 1, which could cause the code to skip over a portion of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length of the operation by 1, which could cause the code to miss a portion of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation, which could cause the code to process the input string twice as many times as it should.

DONE.
