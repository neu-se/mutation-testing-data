Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a delay of 1000 milliseconds before executing the `flush` function, which could lead to tasks being executed much later than intended, potentially causing issues with task ordering and timing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function() { flush(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `requestTick` function to call `flush` directly instead of scheduling it, which could lead to a stack overflow if `flush` is called recursively without yielding control back to the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function() { setTimeout(flush, 0); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it redefines `requestTick` to always use `setTimeout` to call `flush`, which may not be optimal in environments where `process.nextTick` is available, leading to less efficient task execution.

DONE.
