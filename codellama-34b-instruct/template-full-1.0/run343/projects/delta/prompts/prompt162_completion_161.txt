  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the wrong iterator, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the wrong iterator method, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.reset()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to reset the iterator to the beginning of the other delta's operations, potentially leading to the wrong operations being performed.

DONE.
