  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the check is for `undefined`, so if `row.val` is `null`, the check would pass, but it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the check is for `undefined`, so if `row.val` is `NaN`, the check would pass, but it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the check is for `undefined`, so if `row.val` is any falsy value, the check would pass, but it should not.

DONE.
