  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `value[name]` is a function, and `value[name]()` would call that function, whereas `value[name].apply` would attempt to access the `apply` property of the function, which may not exist or may have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because `value[name].call` would attempt to access the `call` property of the function, which may not exist or may have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `value[name].bind` would attempt to access the `bind` property of the function, which may not exist or may have different behavior.

DONE.
