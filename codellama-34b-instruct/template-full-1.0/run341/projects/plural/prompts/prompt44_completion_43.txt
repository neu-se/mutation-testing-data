  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `,` operator would be evaluated before the `+` operator, resulting in a different string concatenation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `,` operator would be evaluated after the `+` operator, resulting in a different string concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate the last character of the word, instead of the last two characters.

DONE.
