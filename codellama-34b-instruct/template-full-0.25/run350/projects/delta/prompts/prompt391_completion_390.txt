  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` is a function that returns the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.next()` calls the function and returns the result of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next()` calls the function and returns the result of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(this.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new iterator for the `this.ops` array, which may have a different order or contents than the original iterator.

DONE.
