  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match the string "/index.html" and "/index.htm" at the end of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match the string "/index.html" and "/index.htm" at the end of the URL, but would also match any other string that ends with a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match the string "/index.html" and "/index.htm" at the end of the URL, but would also match any other string that ends with the word "index".

DONE.
