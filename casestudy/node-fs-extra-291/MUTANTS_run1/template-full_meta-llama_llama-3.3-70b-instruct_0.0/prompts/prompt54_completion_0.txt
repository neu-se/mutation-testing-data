Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(currentPath, targetPath.replace('$', '$$$$'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `path.join` to concatenate the paths instead of the `replace` method, potentially leading to different handling of path separators and edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath + '/' + path.basename(file.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the basename of the file to the target path instead of replacing the entire path, potentially changing the directory structure of the copied files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file.name + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the file name and target path without any replacement or joining, potentially leading to incorrect or malformed paths.

DONE.
