  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.thenResolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `promise` is a promise that may be pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.thenReject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that returns a new promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `promise` is a promise that may be pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback function that is called with the fulfilled value of the promise, and returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback. In this case, the callback function returns a rejected promise, which
