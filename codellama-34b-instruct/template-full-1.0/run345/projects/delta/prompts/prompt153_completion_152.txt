  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the two iterators are now being used in the opposite order, leading to a different outcome of the composing of the deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `hasNext` method, leading to a different outcome of
the composing of the deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `hasNext` method, leading to a different outcome of
the composing of the deltas.

DONE.
