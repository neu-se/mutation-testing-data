  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` and `deferred.resolve` are two different functions that behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that triggers all promise notification handlers, while `deferred.reject` is a function that rejected the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejected the promise with a reason, while `deferred.reject` is a function that rejected the promise with a reason and triggers all promise notification handlers.

DONE.
