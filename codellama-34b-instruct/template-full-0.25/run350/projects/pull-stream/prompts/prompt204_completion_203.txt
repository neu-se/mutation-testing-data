  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called `cb` with `end` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `end` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called `cb` with `null` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `aborted` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called `cb` with `end` as the first argument.

DONE.
