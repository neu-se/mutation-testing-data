  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timer to be cleared immediately, potentially resulting in the rejection of the promise before it has a chance to time out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timer to never be cleared, potentially resulting in the promise never being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it is not a valid identifier, and would cause the code to throw a syntax error.

DONE.
