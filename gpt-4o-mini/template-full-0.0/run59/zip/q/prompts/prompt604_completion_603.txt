Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a promise will cause the `deferred.promise` to resolve immediately with `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Promise.resolve("error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the deferred with a string "error" will cause the promise to resolve with that value, which may not be the intended behavior when dispatching operations that expect a different type of result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Promise.reject(new Error("Failure")));
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting the deferred promise with an error will cause the promise chain to fail immediately, which may not be the desired outcome when dispatching operations that should succeed.

DONE.
