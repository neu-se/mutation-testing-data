  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the `dstOffset` property, even if the `tz.d` value is `undefined` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `0` if `tz.d` is `undefined` or `null`, instead of the `utcOffset` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for the `dstOffset` property, even if the `tz.d` value is not `undefined` or `null`.

DONE.
