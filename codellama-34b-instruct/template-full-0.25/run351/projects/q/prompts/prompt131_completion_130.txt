  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.bind(null)` is a function that takes a single argument, whereas `uncurryThis` is a function that takes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.call(null)` is a function that takes a single argument, whereas `uncurryThis` is a function that takes two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.apply(null)` is a function that takes a single argument, whereas `uncurryThis` is a function that takes two arguments.

DONE.
