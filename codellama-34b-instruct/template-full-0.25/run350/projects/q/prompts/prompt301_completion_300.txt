  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the array would be reversed, which could cause the `join` method to fail if it relies on the specific order of the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain two references to the same object, which could cause the `join` method to fail if it relies on the uniqueness of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain a `null` value, which could cause the `join` method to fail if it relies on the presence of a specific value.

DONE.
