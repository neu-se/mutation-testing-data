  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 2 elements instead of 1, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the current operation minus 1, which could result in skipping over important operations or repeating the same operation multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the current operation plus 1, which could result in skipping over important operations or repeating the same operation multiple times.

DONE.
