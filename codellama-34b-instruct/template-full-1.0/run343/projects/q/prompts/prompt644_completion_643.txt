  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
L
```
This would result in different behavior because `L` is a variable that is not defined in the current scope, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
O
```
This would result in different behavior because `O` is a variable that is not defined in the current scope, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is supposed to be calling a function named `Q`, but by replacing it with `[]`, it is instead calling an empty array and would likely cause a type error.

DONE.
