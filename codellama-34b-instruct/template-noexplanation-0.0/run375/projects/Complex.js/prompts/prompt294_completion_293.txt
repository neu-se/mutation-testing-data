  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to receive the value of `a` instead of `b`, which will result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to receive the value of `b + 1` instead of `b`, which will result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to receive the value of `a * b` instead of `b`, which will result in a different output.

DONE.
