  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length >= 3 && !/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code included a negative condition, whereas this code includes a positive condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ELSE
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code included an "IF" statement, whereas this code includes an "ELSE" statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a')[0].href
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code referred to the href attribute of the first element selected by $('a'), whereas this code refers to the href attribute of the entire collection of elements selected by $('a').

DONE.
