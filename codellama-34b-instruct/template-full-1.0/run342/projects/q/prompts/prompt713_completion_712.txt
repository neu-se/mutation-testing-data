  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid property for the `dispatch` method, and will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an array with a single element (1) will cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that resolves to the value of the `1` property of the object, which is not a valid property and will return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [name]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an array with a single element (`name`) will cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that resolves to the value of the `name` property of the object, which is not a valid property and will return `undefined`.

DONE.
