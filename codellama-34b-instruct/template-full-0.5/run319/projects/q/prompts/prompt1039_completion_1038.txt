  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only resolves the `closed` promise if the `error` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only rejects the `closed` promise if the `error` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only resolves the `closed` promise with a specific error message.

DONE.
