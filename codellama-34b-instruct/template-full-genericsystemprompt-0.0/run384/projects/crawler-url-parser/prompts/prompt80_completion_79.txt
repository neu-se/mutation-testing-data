  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'javascript:alert(1)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would inject JavaScript code into the `href` attribute of the link, which would execute an alert when the link is clicked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the URL of the link to a different domain, which would cause the link to navigate to a different page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'mailto:user@example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the URL of the link to a `mailto:` link, which would cause the link to open the user's email client instead of navigating to a different page.

DONE.
