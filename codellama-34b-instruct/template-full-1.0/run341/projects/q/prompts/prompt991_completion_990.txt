  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `2`, which means that the function would not have the same number of arguments as the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `2`, which means that the function would not have the same number of arguments as the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `2`, which means that the function would not have the same number of arguments as the original function.

DONE.
