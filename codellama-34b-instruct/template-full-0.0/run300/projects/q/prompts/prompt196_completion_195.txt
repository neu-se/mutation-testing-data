  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the file name and not the line number, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` even if the frame is internal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the line number and not the file name, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` even if the frame is internal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the column number and not the file name or line number, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` even if the frame is internal.

DONE.
