  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds a number down to the nearest integer, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point representation of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a constructor function that creates a new number object, whereas `parseFloat` returns a primitive number value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a constructor function that creates a new string object, whereas `parseFloat` returns a primitive number value.

DONE.
