  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always add an "s" to the end of the word, even if it was already plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would add "es" to the end of the word, even if it was already plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air)\b/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/i, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would remove any "s" that appears at the end of the word,
