  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the key value by 1, which would cause the `update` method to update the wrong key in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the key value with the string "1", which would cause the `update` method to update the wrong key in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the key value, which would cause the `update` method to update the wrong key in the database.

DONE.
