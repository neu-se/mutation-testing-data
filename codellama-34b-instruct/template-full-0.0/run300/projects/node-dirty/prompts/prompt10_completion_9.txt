  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the path to uppercase, which could cause the code to look for the file in the wrong location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the path string, which could cause the code to read or write to the wrong location in the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the path string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the delimiter, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could cause the code to look for the file in the wrong location.

DONE.
