  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the `attributes` objects are not the same reference, even if they have the same properties and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the number of properties in the `attributes` objects, rather than the actual values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(newOp.attributes) !== JSON.stringify(lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the stringified versions of the `attributes` objects, rather than the actual objects.

DONE.
