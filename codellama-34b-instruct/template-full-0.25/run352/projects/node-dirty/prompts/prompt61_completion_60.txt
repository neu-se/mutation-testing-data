  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called on the read stream, which would close the stream and prevent any further data from being read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called on the read stream, which would close the stream and prevent any further data from being read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pause` method is called on the read stream, which would temporarily stop the stream from reading data.

DONE.
