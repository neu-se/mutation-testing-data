 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap` object will end up having `null` values for some keys, which might not be expected in the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap` object will end up having empty objects for some keys, which might not be expected in the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ url: currentUrl.url, text: text, type: 'unknown' }
