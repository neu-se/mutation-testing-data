  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == undefined || a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality after converting the operands to the same type, whereas the `===` operator checks for strict equality without type conversion. In this case, if `a` is `null`, `a == undefined` would return `true`, but `a === undefined` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != undefined && a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality after converting the operands to the same type, whereas the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality without type conversion. In this case, if `a` is `null`, `a != undefined` would return `false`, but `a !== undefined` would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator checks for truthiness,
