  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method expects a function as the third argument, but `null` is not a function and will cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method expects a function as the third argument, but `() => {}` is a function that does nothing and will not trigger the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(err) => { console.log(err); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method expects a function as the third argument, but `(err) => { console.log(err); }` is a function that logs an error to the console instead of triggering the expected behavior.

DONE.
