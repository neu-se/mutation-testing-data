```
'criterion', 'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a rule for the pluralization of the word "criterion", while the new code fragment is a rule for the pluralization of the word "criteria".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a rule for the pluralization of the word "criterion", while the new code fragment is a rule for the pluralization of the word "criterions".
