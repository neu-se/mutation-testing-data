  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the latitude and longitude values to calculate the distance and bearing, while the replaced code fragment would always return 1, which would result in incorrect distance and bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the latitude and longitude values to calculate the distance and bearing, while the replaced code fragment would always return 0, which would result in incorrect distance and bearing calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the latitude and longitude values to calculate the distance and bearing, while the replaced code fragment would always return 0, which would result in incorrect distance and bearing calculations.

DONE.
