  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester` function is called with the `test` function as an argument, which would cause the `filterNot` function to return a filtered array of data that does not pass the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester` function is called with the `test` function as an argument and `true` as a second argument, which would cause the `filterNot` function to return a filtered array of data that does not pass the `test` function and also returns the original data that did not pass the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester` function is called with the `test` function as an argument and `false` as a second argument, which would cause the `
