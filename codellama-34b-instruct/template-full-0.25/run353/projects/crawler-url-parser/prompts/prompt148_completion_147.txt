  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/" character to split the path into parts, but the new code uses the "\" character, which would result in different parts being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/" character to split the path into parts, but the new code uses the "/" character as a delimiter, which would result in different parts being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/" character to split the path into parts, but the new code uses the "\" character, which would result in different parts being extracted.

DONE.
