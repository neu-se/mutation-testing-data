  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.hasOwnProperty('current')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it has a property called `current`.

DONE.
