  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of the `!=` operator, which would cause the `deprecated` property to be evaluated as a boolean value instead of a comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of the `!=` operator, which would cause the `deprecated` property to be evaluated as a boolean value instead of a comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of the `!=` operator, which would cause the `deprecated` property to be evaluated as a boolean value instead of a comparison.

DONE.
