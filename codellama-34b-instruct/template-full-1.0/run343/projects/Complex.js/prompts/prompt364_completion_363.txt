  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is the imaginary part of the complex number, which is used in the computation of the `cos` function. Using `c` instead of `b` would result in a different output for the `tanh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, which is used in the computation of the `sinh` function. Using `a` instead of `b` would result in a different output for the `tanh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because negating `b` would result in a different output for the `sin` function, which is used in the computation of the `tanh` function.

DONE.
