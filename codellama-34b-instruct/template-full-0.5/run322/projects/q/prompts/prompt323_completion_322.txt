  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` and `promise.reject` are two different functions with different purposes. `promise.resolve` is used to resolve a promise with a value, while `promise.reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason. Using `promise.resolve` in place of `promise.reject` would cause the promise to resolve with the value of `args`, which may not be the intended behavior.
