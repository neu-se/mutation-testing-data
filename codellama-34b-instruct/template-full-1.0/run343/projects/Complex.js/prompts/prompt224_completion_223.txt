  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `a >= 0` is more inclusive, allowing for a wider range of values of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is almost always a finite number, and `a === Infinity` would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is never `NaN`, and `a >= 0` is always true when `a` is `NaN`.

DONE.
