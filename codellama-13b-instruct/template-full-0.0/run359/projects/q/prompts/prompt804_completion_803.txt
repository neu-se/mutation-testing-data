  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing `undefined` as the second argument to `then`, which means that the `onProgress` callback will not be called. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `void 0, void 0, progressed`, we are passing `undefined` as the third argument to `then`, which means that the `onProgress` callback will be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
