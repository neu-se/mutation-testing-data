  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a / c, b / c);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number with a real part equal to 1, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a * c, b * d);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number with a real part equal to the product of `a` and `c`, and an imaginary part equal to the product of `b` and `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a * c - b * d, a * d + b * c);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number with a real part equal to the difference of the products of `a` and `c`, and an imaginary part equal to the sum of the products of `b` and
