  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would cause the `MessageChannel` to be created with a `port1` property that is not a function, leading to an error when `port1.onmessage` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would cause the `MessageChannel` to be created with a `port1` property that is not a function, leading to an error when `port1.onmessage` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would cause the `MessageChannel` to be created with a `port1` property that is not a function, leading to an error when `port1.onmessage` is called.

DONE.
