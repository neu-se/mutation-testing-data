  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, while the new code fragment `Q.defer().resolve()` resolves the deferred object immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `put` and `get` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, while the new code fragment `Q.defer().reject()` rejects the deferred object immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `put` and `get` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, while the new code fragment `Q.defer().
