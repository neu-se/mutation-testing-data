  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which means that the `delete` method would not be called if the `parsedUrl.protocol` property was not equal to `'http:'` or `'https:'`. By replacing the placeholder with `false`, the `delete` method would be called regardless of the value of `parsedUrl.protocol`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol !== 'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which means that the `delete` method would not be called if the `parsedUrl.protocol` property was not equal to `'http:'`. By replacing the placeholder with `parsedUrl.protocol !== 'http:'`, the `delete` method would be called if the `parsedUrl.protocol` property was not equal to `'http:'` or `'https:'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

parsedUrl.protocol
