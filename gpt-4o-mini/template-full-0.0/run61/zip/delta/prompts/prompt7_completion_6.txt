Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.keys(attributes).reduce<AttributeMap>((copy, key) => { copy[key] = attributes[key]; return copy; }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `attributes` object instead of filtering out null values, potentially retaining keys with null values when `keepNull` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.keys(b).reduce<AttributeMap>((copy, key) => { if (attributes[key] === undefined) { copy[key] = attributes[key]; } return copy; }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assign `undefined` values from `attributes` to `copy`, leading to the loss of valid keys that should have been retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.keys(a).reduce<AttributeMap>((copy, key) => { if (attributes[key] != null) { copy[key] = attributes[key]; } return copy; }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter based on the keys of `
