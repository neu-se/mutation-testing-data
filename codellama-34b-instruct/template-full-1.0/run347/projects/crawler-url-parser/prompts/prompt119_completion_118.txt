  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let pageurl = "https://www.example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `baseUrl` as the second argument to the `parse` function, while the modified code uses a hardcoded URL as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let pageurl = "https://www.example.com/path/to/resource";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `baseUrl` as the second argument to the `parse` function, while the modified code uses a hardcoded URL that includes a path as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let pageurl = "https://www.example.com:8080";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `baseUrl` as the second argument to the `parse` function, while the modified code uses a hardcoded URL that includes a port number as the second argument.
