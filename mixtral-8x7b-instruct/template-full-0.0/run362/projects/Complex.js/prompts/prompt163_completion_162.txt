 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'div' method would incorrectly return 'INFINITY' when dividing by zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat the divisor as a real number when it has a non-zero imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] === 0 && z['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly handle the case where the exponent is a positive real number, causing incorrect results for the 'pow' method.

DONE.
