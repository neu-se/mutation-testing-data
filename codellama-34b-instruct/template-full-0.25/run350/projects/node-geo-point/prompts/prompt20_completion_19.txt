  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, rather than checking if the property exists on the object or its prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `true` if either of the operands is truthy, rather than checking if both operands are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('altitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will return `true` if all of the operands are truthy,
