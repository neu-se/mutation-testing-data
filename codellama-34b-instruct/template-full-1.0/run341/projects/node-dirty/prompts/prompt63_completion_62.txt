  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.end()` would not call the callback function with the error object, which could result in uncaught errors and inconsistent behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.destroy()` would cause the write stream to be closed and destroyed immediately, which could result in data loss and inconsistent behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value and would not cause an error, but it would also not write any data to the file, which could result in inconsistent behavior.

Done.
