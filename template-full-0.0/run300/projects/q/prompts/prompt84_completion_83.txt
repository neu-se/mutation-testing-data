  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called later, but calling it immediately would cause `flush` to be called immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick.bind(null)` creates a new function that, when called, will call `requestTick` with a `this` value of `null`, which could cause `requestTick` to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick.bind(undefined)` creates a new function that, when called, will call `requestTick` with a `this` value of `undefined`, which could cause `requestTick` to behave differently.

DONE.
