  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first one, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the last element of the `ref` array instead of the first one, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length / 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the middle element of the `ref` array instead of the first one, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this case.

DONE.
