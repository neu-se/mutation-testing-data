  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` has illegal characters, while this new code fragment checks if it does not have illegal characters. This would cause the function to return `null` in cases where the original code fragment would have returned a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) || currentUrlStr.length < 3;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` has illegal characters, while this new code fragment checks if it has illegal characters or is shorter than 3 characters. This would cause the function to return `null` in cases where the original code fragment would have returned a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && currentUrl
