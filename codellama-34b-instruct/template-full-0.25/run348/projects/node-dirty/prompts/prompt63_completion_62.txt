  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called on the write stream, which would cause it to stop accepting new data and wait for the buffer to be flushed before destroying the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called on the write stream, which would cause it to immediately close the stream and destroy the underlying file descriptor, without waiting for the buffer to be flushed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called on the write stream, which would cause it to stop accepting new data and wait for the buffer to be flushed before closing the stream.

DONE.
