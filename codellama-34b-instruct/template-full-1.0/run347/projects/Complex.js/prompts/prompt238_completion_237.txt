  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b + 1```
This would result in different behavior because the value of b is being incremented by 1, which would change the result of the computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b * 2```
This would result in different behavior because the value of b is being multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b / 2```
This would result in different behavior because the value of b is being divided by 2, which would change the result of the computation.

DONE.
