  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` if both operands are infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` if either operand is infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the left operand is infinite and the right operand is not, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
