  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `||` operator instead of the `&&` operator. This change will cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which may affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort && true, done && function () {})
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `&&` operator instead of the `||` operator. This change will cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which may affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, done)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it does not use the `||` or `&&` operators. This change will cause the `read` function to be called with a different set
