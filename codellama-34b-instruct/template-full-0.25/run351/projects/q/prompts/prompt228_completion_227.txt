  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the arguments to the `messages` array, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the arguments instead of the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push only the first argument to the `messages` array, which would cause the promise to be resolved with only the first argument instead of the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push only the second argument to the `messages` array, which would cause the promise to be resolved with only the second argument instead of the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
