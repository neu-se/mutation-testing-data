  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will flip the sign of the value, causing the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of x will be increased by 1, causing the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of x will be doubled, causing the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
