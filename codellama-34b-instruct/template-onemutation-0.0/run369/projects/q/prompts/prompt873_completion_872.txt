  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with a specific set of arguments, but by replacing it with `null`, the function will not be called at all, and the promise will be resolved with `null` instead of the expected value.
