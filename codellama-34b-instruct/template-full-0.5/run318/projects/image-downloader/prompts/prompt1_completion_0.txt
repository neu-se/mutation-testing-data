  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url && !options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an error if both `options.url` and `options.dest` are falsy, whereas the original code would only return an error if `options.url` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === 'https://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an error if `options.url` is equal to `'https://example.com'`, whereas the original code would only return an error if `options.url` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url || !options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an error if either `options.url` or `options.dest` are falsy, whereas the original code would only return an error if `options.url` is falsy.
