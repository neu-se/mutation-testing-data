  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a different element to the `all` array instead of the `id` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(tz.p);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a different element to the `all` array instead of the `id` element, and it also uses a different property of the `tz` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(uniformTz(id));
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a different element to the `all` array, which is the result of calling the `uniformTz` function with the `id` as an argument.

DONE.
