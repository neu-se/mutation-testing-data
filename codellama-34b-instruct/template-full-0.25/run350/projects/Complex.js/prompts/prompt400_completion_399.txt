  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which performs addition, while the new code fragment uses the `-` operator, which performs subtraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `*` operator, which performs multiplication, while the new code fragment uses the `/` operator, which performs division.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator, which performs division, while the new code fragment uses the `*` operator, which performs multiplication.

DONE.
