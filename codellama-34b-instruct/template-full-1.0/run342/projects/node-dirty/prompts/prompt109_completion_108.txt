  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is a writable stream, while `this.emit` is a method that emits an event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is an object, while `this.emit` is a method that emits an event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is an object, while `this.emit` is a method that emits an event.

DONE.
