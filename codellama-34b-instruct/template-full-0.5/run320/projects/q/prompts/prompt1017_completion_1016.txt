  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called instead of the `deferred.resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function would be called instead of the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.
