  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 'corrupted file'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to emit an "error" event with the message "corrupted file" instead of the actual error object, which would make it harder to debug the issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to emit an "error" event with a null message, which would result in an "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'emit' of null" error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('corrupted file')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to emit an "error" event with a new error object that has the message "corrupted file", which would make it easier to debug the issue.

DONE.
