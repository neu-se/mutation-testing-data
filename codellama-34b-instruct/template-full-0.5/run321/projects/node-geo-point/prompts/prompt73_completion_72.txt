  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be doubled, which would affect the final destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be reduced by 10 meters, which would affect the final destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + Math.random() * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be randomized by up to 10 meters, which would affect the final destination point.

DONE.
