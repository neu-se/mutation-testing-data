  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument `1` would cause the `set` method to fail, as it expects only two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set would be different than the original code, causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key being set would be different than the original code, causing the test to fail.

DONE.
