  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, regardless of the actual value of hypot, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return NaN, regardless of the actual value of hypot, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the actual value of hypot, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
