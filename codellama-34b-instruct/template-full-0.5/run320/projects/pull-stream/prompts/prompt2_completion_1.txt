  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.filter(function(source) { return source.type === 'buggy' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would only return sources that have a `type` property equal to `'buggy'`, while the original code fragment would return all sources.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.map(function(source) { return source.name })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return an array of the `name` property of each source, while the original code fragment would return an array of sources.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.reduce(function(acc, source) { return acc + source.count }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return the sum of the `count` property of each source, while the original code fragment would return an array of sources.

DONE.
