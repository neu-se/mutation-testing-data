  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, instead of the actual line index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "abc", instead of the actual line index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return NaN (Not a Number), instead of the actual line index.

DONE.
