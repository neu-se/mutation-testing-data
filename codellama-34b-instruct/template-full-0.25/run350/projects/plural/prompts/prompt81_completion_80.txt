  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has the word "geese" as the second element, while the new code fragment has "gese".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has the word "geese" as the second element, while the new code fragment has "goose".

DONE.
