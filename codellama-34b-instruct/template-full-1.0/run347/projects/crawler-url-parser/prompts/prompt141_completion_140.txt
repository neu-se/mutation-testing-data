  Okay, I'll give it a try!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the path would no longer be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the path would no longer be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the path would no longer be removed.

DONE.
