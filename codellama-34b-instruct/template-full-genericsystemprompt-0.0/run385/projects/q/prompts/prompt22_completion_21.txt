  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `domain.exit()` function to be called only if `domain` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would always call `domain.exit()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `domain.exit()` function to be called only if `domain` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would always call `domain.exit()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain || domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the `domain.exit()` function to be called only if `domain` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would always call `domain.exit()`.

DONE.
