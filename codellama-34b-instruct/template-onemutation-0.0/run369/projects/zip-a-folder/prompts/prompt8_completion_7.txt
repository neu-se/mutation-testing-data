  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while the new code fragment checks for inequality. This change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the `targetBasePath` and `src` are not equal, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
