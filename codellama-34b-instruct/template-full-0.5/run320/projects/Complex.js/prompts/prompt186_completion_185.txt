  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `a`, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be returned, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the values of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the value of `a`.

DONE.
