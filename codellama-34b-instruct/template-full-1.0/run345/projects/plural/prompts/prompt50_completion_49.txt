  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches words that end with the letter "o", whereas the original code fragment matched words that end with "o" or "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the letter "o" at the end of the word, but it does not consider the case of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the letter "y" at the end of the word, but it does not consider the case of the word.

DONE.
