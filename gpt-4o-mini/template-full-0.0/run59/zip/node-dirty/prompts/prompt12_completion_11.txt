Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknownKey'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string `'unknownKey'` as the key, causing the callbacks to be associated with a constant key instead of the intended dynamic key, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to retrieve or manage the callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the key would cause the `_queue` to store callbacks under the `null` key, which is not a valid key for the intended operations, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors when trying to access or execute those callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because appending `'1'` to the key would create a new key that is different from the original, causing the callbacks to be stored under a modified key, which would prevent the correct execution of callbacks associated with the original key.

DONE.
