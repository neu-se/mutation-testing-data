 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the directory path to the current directory, which may not be the intended behavior when compressing a given folder or a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
src.split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last part of the directory path, which may not be the intended behavior when compressing a given folder or a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'..'
```
This would result in different behavior because it moves up one directory level, which may not be the intended behavior when compressing a given folder or a glob.

DONE.
