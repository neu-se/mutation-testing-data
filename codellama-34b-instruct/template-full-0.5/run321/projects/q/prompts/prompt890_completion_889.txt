  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).ncall
```
This would result in different behavior because `ncall` is a different method of the `Q` function that takes a callback function and an array of arguments, whereas `nfapply` takes a callback function and a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `nbind` is a different method of the `Q` function that creates a new function that, when called, calls the original function with the specified context and arguments, whereas `nfapply` calls the function with the specified arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).npost
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` is a different method of the `Q` function that calls a method of an object with the specified arguments and a callback, whereas `nfapply` calls a function with the specified arguments and a callback.

DONE.
