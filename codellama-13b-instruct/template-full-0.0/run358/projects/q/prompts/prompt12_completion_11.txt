  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ses` variable is defined, while this code fragment checks if it is not defined. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `ses` variable is not defined, which could be useful for testing purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ses` variable is defined, while this code fragment checks if it is null. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `ses` variable is null, which could be useful for testing purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ses` variable is defined, while this code fragment checks if the `ok()` method is defined on the `ses` variable. This could potentially cause
