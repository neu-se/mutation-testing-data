  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted op would have a different length, which could affect the behavior of the `compose` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted op would have a different length, which could affect the behavior of the `compose` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted op would not have a length, which could affect the behavior of the `compose` function.

DONE.
