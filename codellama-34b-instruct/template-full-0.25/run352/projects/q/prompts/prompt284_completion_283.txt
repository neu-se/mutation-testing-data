  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` would reject the promise, whereas `self.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.notify` would notify the promise, whereas `self.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.fulfill` would fulfill the promise, whereas `self.resolve` would resolve it.

DONE.
