  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not being called with the correct number of arguments. The original code fragment had a single argument, but the new code fragment has two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not being called with the correct argument type. The original code fragment had a single argument of type `Complex`, but the new code fragment has a single argument of type `number`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not being called with the correct argument value. The original code fragment had a single argument with a value of `Infinity`, but the new code
