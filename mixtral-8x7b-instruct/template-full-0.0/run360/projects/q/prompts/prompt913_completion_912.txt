 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects a variable number of arguments, but it is provided with an array, which would cause the `concat` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects a variable number of arguments, but it is provided with `null`, which would cause an error in the `concat` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects a variable number of arguments, but it is provided with a function, which would cause an error in the `concat` method.

DONE.
