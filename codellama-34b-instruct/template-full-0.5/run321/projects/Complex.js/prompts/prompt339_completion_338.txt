  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return `new Complex(0, Infinity)` when `a` or `b` is 0, whereas the original code fragment only allows it when both `a` and `b` are 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return `new Complex(0, Infinity)` when `a` is 0 and `b` is not 0, whereas the original code fragment only allows it when both `a` and `b` are 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return `new Complex(0, Infinity)` when `a` is not 0 and `b` is
