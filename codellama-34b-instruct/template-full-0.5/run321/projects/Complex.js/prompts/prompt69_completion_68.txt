  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws a `SyntaxError`, while this replacement throws a more general `Error`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws a `SyntaxError`, while this replacement throws a more general `Error` without using the `new` keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw SyntaxError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws a `SyntaxError`, while this replacement throws a `SyntaxError` with a different message.

DONE.
