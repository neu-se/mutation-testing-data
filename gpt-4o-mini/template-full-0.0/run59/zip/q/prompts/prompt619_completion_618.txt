Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key, "extraArg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument to the dispatch call, which may cause the method to fail or behave unexpectedly since the original method expects only the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fetch", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from "get" to "fetch", which may not be defined in the dispatch method, leading to an error or a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the key instead of the actual key, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior when trying to access a property on the object.

DONE.
