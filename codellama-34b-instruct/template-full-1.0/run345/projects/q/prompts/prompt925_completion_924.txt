  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable and not a method, so using it as a function call would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer().promise` returns a promise object, not a function, so using it as a function call would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer().makeNodeResolver()` returns a function, but that function does not have the same signature as the `denodeify` function that it is replacing.

DONE.
