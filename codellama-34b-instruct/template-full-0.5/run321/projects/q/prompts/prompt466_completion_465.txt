  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called even if the reason has already been handled, which could lead to unexpected consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called only if there are unhandled rejections, which could lead to unexpected consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called only if the promise has not already been reported as unhandled, which could lead to unexpected consequences.

DONE.
