  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the attribute if both `a` and `b` have the same key with `undefined` value, whereas the original code fragment would set the attribute if `a` has the key with any value other than `undefined` and `b` has the key with `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the attribute if the values of `a` and `b` are not equal, whereas the original code fragment would set the attribute if `a` has the key with any value other than `undefined` and `b` has the key with `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a[key] && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the attribute if
