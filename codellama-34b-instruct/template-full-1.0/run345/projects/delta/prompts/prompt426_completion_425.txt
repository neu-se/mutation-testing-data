  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether `op.delete` is not null, but the original code fragment checked whether `op.delete` is a number. This would cause the function to return a different value if `op.delete` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether `op.delete` is not a number, but the original code fragment checked whether `op.delete` is a number. This would cause the function to return a different value if `op.delete` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete ? 1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether `op.delete` is truthy or falsy, but the original code fragment checked whether `op.delete` is a number. This would cause the function to return a
