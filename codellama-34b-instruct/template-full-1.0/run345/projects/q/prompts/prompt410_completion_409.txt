  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is a method, not a property, and must be called to return the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is a method, not a property, and must be called with the `call()` method to set the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.bind(value)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is a method, not a property, and must be called with the `bind()` method to set the `this` context and immediately invoke the resulting function.

DONE.
