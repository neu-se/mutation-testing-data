  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds elements to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.splice(0, 0, ...rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds elements to a specific position in an array, whereas `push` adds elements to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules = [...rules, ...this.rules]
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the new rules with the existing rules in a different order.

DONE.
