  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 360` would cause the bearing to always be positive, even if the points are on opposite sides of the globe.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 360` would cause the bearing to always be negative, even if the points are on the same side of the globe.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the bearing to be twice as large as it should be, which could cause errors in calculations that use the bearing.

DONE.
