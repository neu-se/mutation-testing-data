  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call` is not the same as `pull.apply`. While `pull.apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, `pull.call` calls a function with a given `this` value and comma-separated arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind` returns a new function with a bound this value and separated arguments, while `pull.apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.curry
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.curry` returns a new function that takes any number of arguments and applies them to the original function, while `pull.apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.
