  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` is not the same as `values`. The former is a property of the `stream` object, while the latter is a function that returns an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values()` is not the same as `values()`. The former is a method that returns an array of values, while the latter is a function that returns a stream of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values.map(function(value) { return value })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values.map(function(value) { return value })` is not the same as `values`. The former is a method that returns an array of values, while the latter is a function that returns a stream of values. Additionally, the `map` method is used to transform the array of values
