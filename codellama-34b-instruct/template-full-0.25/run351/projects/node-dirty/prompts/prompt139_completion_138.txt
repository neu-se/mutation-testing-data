  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `cbs` array is empty and if `err` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the `cbs` array has a length of 0 and if `err` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 || err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `cbs` array is empty and if `err` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the `cbs` array has a length of 0 or if `err` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `cbs` array is empty and if `err` is not null, while the new code fragment
