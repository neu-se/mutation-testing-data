  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(resolved(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is not a function and would cause a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is not a function and would cause a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` does not match the signature of the `become` function and would cause a TypeError.

DONE.
