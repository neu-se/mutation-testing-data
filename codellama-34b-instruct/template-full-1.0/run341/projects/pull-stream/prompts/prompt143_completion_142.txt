  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would not be called and `generate()` would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the function would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"", generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the function would not be executed.

DONE.
