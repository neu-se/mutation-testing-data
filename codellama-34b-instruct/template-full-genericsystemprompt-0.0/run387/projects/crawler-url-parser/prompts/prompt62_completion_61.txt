  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` is a string representation of the URL, while `parsedUrl` is an object containing the parsed URL components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.pathname` is the path component of the URL, while `parsedUrl` is an object containing the parsed URL components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.search` is the search component of the URL, while `parsedUrl` is an object containing the parsed URL components.

DONE.
