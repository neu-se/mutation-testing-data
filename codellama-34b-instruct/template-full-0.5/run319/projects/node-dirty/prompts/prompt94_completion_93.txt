  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is the inverse of `JSON.parse` and would cause the code to fail to parse the JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which would cause the code to fail to parse the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be returned, which would cause the code to fail to parse the JSON data.

DONE.
