  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This change will cause the iterator to advance by two elements instead of one, which may result in a different set of attributes being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes && {}
```
This change will cause the iterator to return an empty object instead of the attributes of the next element, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || { foo: 'bar' }
```
This change will cause the iterator to return an object with a `foo` property set to `'bar'` instead of the attributes of the next element, which may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
