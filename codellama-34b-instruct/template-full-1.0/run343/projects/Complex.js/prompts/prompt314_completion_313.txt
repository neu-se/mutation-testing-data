  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which returned `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negative of the same value that the original code fragment returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which returned `b`. The original code fragment returns the value of `b`, while the replaced code fragment returns `b` squared.

DONE.
