Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increments the base index by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping over an operation and leading to incorrect transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the base index, which could cause the function to access an invalid or unintended operation, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the length of the operation to the base index, which could cause the function to skip over subsequent operations and result in incorrect transformations or omissions.

DONE.
