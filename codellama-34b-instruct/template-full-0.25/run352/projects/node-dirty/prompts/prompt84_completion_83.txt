  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character from `\n` to `\r\n`, which is a different newline sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the newline character altogether, which could cause issues with parsing the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the newline character with a space character, which could cause issues with parsing the data.

DONE.
