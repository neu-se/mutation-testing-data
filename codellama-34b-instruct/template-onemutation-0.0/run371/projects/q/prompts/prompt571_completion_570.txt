  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments. Using `call` instead of `apply` would cause the generator function to be called with the wrong `this` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
