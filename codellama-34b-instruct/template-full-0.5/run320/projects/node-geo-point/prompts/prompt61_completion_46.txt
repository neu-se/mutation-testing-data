  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + 0.000001
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a small value to the latitude, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be slightly different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of the destination point instead of the latitude of the starting point, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + Math.random() * 0.000001
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a small random value to the latitude, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be slightly different from the original code each time the function is called.

DONE.
