  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called with a null value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called with an undefined value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value instead of the expected value.

DONE.
