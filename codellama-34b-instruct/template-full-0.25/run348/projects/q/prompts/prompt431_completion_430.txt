  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `false` for a rejected promise, instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `false` for a rejected promise, instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `true` for a rejected promise, instead of `false`.

DONE.
