  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 1 element instead of the default 1 element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 2 elements instead of the default 1 element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 3 elements instead of the default 1 element.

DONE.
