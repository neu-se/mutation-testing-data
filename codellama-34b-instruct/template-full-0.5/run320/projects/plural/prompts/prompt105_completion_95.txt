  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matched the words "bison", "cod", "deer", "fowl", "halibut", "moose", and "sheep" exactly, while this new code fragment would match any word that contains those letters in the same order, regardless of whether they are separated by other letters. For example, the word "fowl" would still be matched by the new code fragment, but the word "foul" would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word unchanged if it was not one of the specified words
