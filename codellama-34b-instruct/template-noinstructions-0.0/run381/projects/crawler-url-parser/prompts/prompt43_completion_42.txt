  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with a different `host` property, which would affect the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with a `host` property that is `null`, which would affect the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with a `host` property that is `undefined`, which would affect the rest of the code.

DONE.
