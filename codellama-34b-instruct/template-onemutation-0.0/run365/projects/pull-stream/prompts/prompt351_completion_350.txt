  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with the `data` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the `prop` function. The `prop` function is intended to be called with a property name as its argument, not a data object.

DONE.
