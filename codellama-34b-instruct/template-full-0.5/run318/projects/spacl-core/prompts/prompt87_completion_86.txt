  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(rule.name))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is being called with the `rule.name` property instead of the `name` property of the new policy. As a result, the cloned rules would have the same name as the original rules, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is being called with a different argument than the original code fragment. This could cause the cloned rules to have different properties than the original rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is being called with a different argument than the original code
