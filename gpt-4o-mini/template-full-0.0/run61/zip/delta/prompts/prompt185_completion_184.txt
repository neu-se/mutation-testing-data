Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the code to proceed when `otherOp.retain` is not a number, potentially leading to unexpected results when composing operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `otherOp.retain` as valid when it is `null`, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that should be processed differently when `retain` is explicitly defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the code to proceed if `otherOp.retain` is strictly `true`, ignoring any numeric values or other valid cases, which could break the expected logic of the operation composition.

DONE.
