  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a negated character class instead of a positive one. This change will cause the regular expression to match words that end with a consonant followed by "o", instead of words that end with a vowel followed by "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This code fragment is the same as the original, but with a redundant character class. This change will not affect the behavior of the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but without the "i" flag. This change will cause the regular expression to match words that end with a vowel followed by "o", but only if the vowel is lowercase.

DONE.
