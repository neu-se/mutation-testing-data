  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the first argument to the callback, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the negation of the data as the second argument to the callback, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the data plus one as the second argument to the callback, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

DONE.
