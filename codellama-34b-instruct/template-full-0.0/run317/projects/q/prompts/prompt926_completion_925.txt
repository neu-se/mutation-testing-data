  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with a value, but `null` is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with a value, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with a value, but `function () {}` is a different function that would be called instead.

DONE.
