 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value, which in this case is the `Promise` instance. The original code uses `this.dispatch` directly, which allows the method to access and modify the instance's properties. By using `bind`, the mutated code would not have the same effect as the original code, as it would not be able to modify the instance's properties directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the `this` value of the function to the provided value. In this case, setting `this` to `null` would cause issues, as `this` should refer to the `Promise` instance. The original code uses `this.dispatch` directly, which allows the method to access and modify the instance's properties. By using `call` with `null`,
