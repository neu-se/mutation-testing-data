  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` returns `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` otherwise. The negation operator `!` would invert the result, so `!Number.isFinite` would return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, and `false` otherwise. This would cause the `if` statement to execute the `return Complex['INFINITY']` line when the argument is a finite number, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` returns `true` if the argument is NaN, and `false` otherwise. This would cause the `if` statement to execute the `return Complex['INFINITY']` line when the argument is NaN, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
