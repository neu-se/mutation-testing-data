  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the operands, causing the test to pass when the `ended` variable is true, regardless of the value of the `end` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the test to pass when either the `end` or `ended` variable is false, regardless of the value of the other variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end == !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `end` variable to the negation of the `ended` variable, causing the test to pass when the two variables have opposite values.

DONE.
