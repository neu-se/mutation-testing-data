 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
o.compression < COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the compression level is less than uncompressed, which is never true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
o.compression = COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
