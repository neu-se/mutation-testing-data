Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable used in the cosine calculation from the real part `a` to the imaginary part `b`, leading to incorrect results for the tangent function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the real part `a`, which alters the angle used in the cosine calculation, resulting in an incorrect tangent value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine calculation with the sine of `a`, which fundamentally changes the mathematical operation and leads to incorrect results for the tangent function.

DONE.
