  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the first segment of the path, which may be important for the matcher to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments back together with a '/' separator, which may not be what the matcher expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments back together with an empty string separator, which may not be what the matcher expects.

DONE.
