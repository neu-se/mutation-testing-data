  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the splice operation would be off by one, leading to the newOp being inserted at the wrong position in the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the newOp would be inserted twice into the ops array, leading to a duplicate operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the otherOp would be inserted into the ops array, leading to a different set of operations being performed.

DONE.
