Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a string instead of checking if it is an object, which would cause the function to return `1` for string values instead of handling the case for objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is strictly equal to `null`, which would incorrectly return `1` when `op.retain` is an object or a number, thus bypassing the intended logic for handling retain operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is undefined, which would lead to returning `1` when `op.retain` is not provided, ignoring valid retain operations that should be counted.

DONE.
