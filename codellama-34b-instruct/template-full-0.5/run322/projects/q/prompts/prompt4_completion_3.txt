  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return 0 instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the string "hello" instead of the expected value.

DONE.
