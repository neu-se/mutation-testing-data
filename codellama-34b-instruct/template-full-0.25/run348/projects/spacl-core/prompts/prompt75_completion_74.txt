  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to return `true` instead of `null` when the action is explicitly denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to return `false` instead of `null` when the action is explicitly denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to return `false` instead of `null` when the action is explicitly denied.

DONE.
