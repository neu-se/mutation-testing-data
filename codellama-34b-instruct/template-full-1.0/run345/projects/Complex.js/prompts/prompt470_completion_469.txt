  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === 0` will only evaluate to true when `b` is equal to 0, whereas `1 !== b` will evaluate to true when `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - 1` will always be equal to 0, whereas `1 !== b` will evaluate to true when `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 !== b && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 !== b && b !== 0` will evaluate to true when `b` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 0. Whereas `1 !== b` alone will evaluate to true when b is not equal to 1.

DONE.
