  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called, and the tasks would not be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called, and the tasks would not be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called, and the tasks would not be processed.

DONE.
