  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
     b[a]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[a]` would try to access the property `a` of the variable `b`, which may not exist or be defined, leading to a different result or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	  b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation `b + a` would perform addition between `b` and `a`, potentially resulting in a different result or error if the values are not compatible or the operations are not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    b.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.prototype` would try to access the `prototype` property of the variable `b`, which may not exist or be defined, leading to a different result or error.

DONE.
