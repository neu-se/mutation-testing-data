 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function does not return the result of `_readFile`, and instead always returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_readFile.bind(null, 'incorrectFile')
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFile` would always attempt to read the file named 'incorrectFile', regardless of the input provided to the `readFile` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(file, options) => _readFile(file, { ...options, throws: false })
