  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this new fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0. This change would cause the first `if` statement in the `pow` method to execute differently, potentially leading to errors in the calculation of the complex power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this new fragment checks if the product of `a` and `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause the conditional statement in the `pow` method to execute differently, potentially leading to errors in the calculation of the complex power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new fragment
