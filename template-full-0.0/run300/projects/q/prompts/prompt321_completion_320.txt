  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is used to create a new promise in the `Promise` constructor, and replacing it with `null` would cause the constructor to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is used to create a new promise in the `Promise` constructor, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the constructor to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is used to create a new promise in the `Promise` constructor, and replacing it with `0` would cause the constructor to throw an error.

DONE.
