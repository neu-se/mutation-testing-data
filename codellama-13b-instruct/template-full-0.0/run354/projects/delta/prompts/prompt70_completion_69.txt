  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while the modified code fragment checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key and the value of that key is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0 &&
      typeof attributes[Object.keys(attributes)[0]] === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while the modified code fragment checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key and the value of that key is an object. Additionally, the modified code fragment checks if the value of the first key in the `attributes` object is also an object.

Option 3: The PLACEH
