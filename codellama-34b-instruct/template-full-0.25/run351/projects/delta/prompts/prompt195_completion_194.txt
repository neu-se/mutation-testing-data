  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` is a function that checks if two values are equal, while `!isEqual` is the negation of that function, meaning it checks if two values are not equal. This would cause the code to behave differently when comparing values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is a function that checks if two values are not equal, while `isEqual` is a function that checks if two values are equal. This would cause the code to behave differently when comparing values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because `===` is a comparison operator that checks if two values are equal, while `!==` is the negation of that operator, meaning it checks if two values are not equal. This would cause the code to behave differently when comparing values.

DONE.
