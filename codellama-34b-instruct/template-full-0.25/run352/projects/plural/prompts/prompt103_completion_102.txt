  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is missing the word boundary anchors, which would cause the regular expression to match any word that contains the letters "bison", "cod", "deer", "fowl", "halibut", "moose", or "sheep", regardless of whether they are at the beginning or end of a word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is missing the "i" flag, which would cause the regular expression to match any word that contains the letters "bison", "cod", "deer", "fowl", "halibut", "moose", or "sheep", regardless of whether they are at the beginning or end of a word.
