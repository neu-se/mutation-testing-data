 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ops` array, and any modifications to the `ops` array in the `Delta` class will not affect the shallow copy, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that relies on the mutated `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign([], ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same elements as the `ops` array but does not copy the nested objects, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that relies on the mutated `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.concat()
