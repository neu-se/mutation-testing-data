Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because lastIndexOf returns the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas indexOf returns the first occurrence, potentially leading to incorrect results if the ESCAPE_SYMBOL appears multiple times in the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.search
```
This would result in different behavior because search returns the index of the first match of the regular expression, whereas indexOf returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, and the regular expression may match differently than the literal string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because includes returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is found, whereas indexOf returns the index of the first occurrence, requiring an additional check to determine if the value was found.

DONE.
