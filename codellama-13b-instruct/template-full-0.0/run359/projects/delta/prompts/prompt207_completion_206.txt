  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.retain` property is a number, while the original code fragment `otherOp` is an object. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `otherOp` object has a `retain` property that is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.insert` property is a string, while the original code fragment `otherOp` is an object. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `otherOp` object has an `insert` property that is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.attributes` property is an object, while the original code fragment `otherOp` is an object. This could cause the code
