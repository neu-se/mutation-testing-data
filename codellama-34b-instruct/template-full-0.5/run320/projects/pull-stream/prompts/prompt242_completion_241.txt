  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!data` expression would negate the `data` variable, causing the `test(data)` function to always return `false`, even if `data` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data*2` expression would multiply the `data` variable by 2, causing the `test(data)` function to always return `true`, even if `data` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.property
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data.property` expression would access a property on the `data` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original `data` variable.

DONE.
