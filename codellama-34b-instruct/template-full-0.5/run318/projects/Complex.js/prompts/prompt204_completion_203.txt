  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `b` variable, which would change the result of the `atan2` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `a` variable, which would change the result of the `pow` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `a` variable, which would change the result of the `pow` function.

DONE.
