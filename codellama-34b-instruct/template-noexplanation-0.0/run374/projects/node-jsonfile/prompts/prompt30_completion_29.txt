  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to return an empty string, which may cause issues with the `JSON.parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to return `undefined`, which may also cause issues with the `JSON.parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to return an empty object, which may cause issues with the `JSON.parse` function.

DONE.
