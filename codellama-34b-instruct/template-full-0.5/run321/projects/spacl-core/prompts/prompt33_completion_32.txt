  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last part of the path, rather than the entire path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/')[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the path, rather than the entire path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the entire path, but in reverse order.

DONE.
