  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `null` as its first argument, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `undefined` as its first argument, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `0` as its first argument, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
