  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `name` property of the `timezone` object is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `name` property of the `timezone` object is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name === 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while this replacement checks if the `name` property of the `timezone` object is equal to the string 'UTC'.

DONE.
