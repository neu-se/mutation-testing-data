  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the ID of the country instead of the country object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the country instead of the country object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.timezones[0], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first timezone of the country instead of the country object itself.

DONE.
