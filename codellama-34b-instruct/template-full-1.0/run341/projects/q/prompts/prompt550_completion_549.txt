  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject a promise with a reason, whereas the `Q` function in the original code fragment is used to return a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is used to create a new deferred object, whereas the `Q` function in the original code fragment is used to return a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is used to resolve a promise with a value, whereas the `Q` function in the original code fragment is used to return a new promise.

DONE.
