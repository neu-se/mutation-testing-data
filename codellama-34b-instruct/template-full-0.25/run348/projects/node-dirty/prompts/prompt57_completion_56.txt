  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different. The original code listens for the `'drain'` event, which is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the modified code listens for the `'close'` event, which is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is different. The original code calls the `close` method on the `Dirty` instance, while the modified code calls the `close` method on the `writeStream` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different. The original code emits the `'drain'` event, while the modified code emits the `'close'` event.

DONE
