Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `options.reviver` always exists, which could lead to a runtime error if `options` is null or undefined, or if `reviver` is not a property of `options`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `null` as the reviver function to `JSON.parse`, which means that the parsing will not be customized, even if a reviver function is provided in the `options`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options && options.reviver || function(key, value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it provides a default reviver function that simply returns the original value, which could lead to different parsing results if the original code relied on the absence of a reviver function.

DONE.
