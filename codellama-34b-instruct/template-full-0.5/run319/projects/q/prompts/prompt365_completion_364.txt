  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `then` callback to be called when the promise is rejected, rather than when it is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, causing the `then` callback to never be called, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, causing the `then` callback to always be called, even if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
