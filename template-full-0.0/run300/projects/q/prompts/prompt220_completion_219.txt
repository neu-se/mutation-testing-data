  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG === "true"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is defined, while this new code fragment checks if it is defined and has the value `"true"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG !== "false"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is defined, while this new code fragment checks if it is defined and has a value that is not `"false"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG === "false"
```
