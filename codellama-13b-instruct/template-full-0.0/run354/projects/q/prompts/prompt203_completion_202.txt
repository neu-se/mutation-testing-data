  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined` for any stack trace that contains the string `"@"`, which would then cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for any stack trace that contains the string `"@"`, which would then cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to not concatenate the stack trace of the `promise` with the stack trace of the `error`, which would then cause the `filterStackString` function to not remove any internal frames from the stack trace, which would then cause the `isInternalFrame` function to not filter out any internal frames from the stack trace, which would then cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to not concatenate the stack trace of the `promise` with the stack trace of the `error`, which would then cause the `filterStackString` function to not remove any internal frames from the stack trace, which would then cause the `isInternalFrame` function to not filter out any internal frames from the stack trace, and so on.
