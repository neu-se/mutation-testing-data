  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback function, while this modified code fragment passes `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback function, while this modified code fragment passes `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback function, while this modified code fragment passes a new Error object.

DONE.
