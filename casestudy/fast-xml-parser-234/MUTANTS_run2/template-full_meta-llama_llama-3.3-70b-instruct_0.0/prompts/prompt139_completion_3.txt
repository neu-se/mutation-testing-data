Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-zA-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any trailing letters from the string instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\./
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the decimal point at the beginning of the string, if present, instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[eE][+-]?\d+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any exponent part from the string (e.g., "1.23e-4" would become "1.23"), instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

DONE.
