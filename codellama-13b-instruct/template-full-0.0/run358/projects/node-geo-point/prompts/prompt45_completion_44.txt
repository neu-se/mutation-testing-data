  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 0 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `1` if `r` is greater than `1`, while this code fragment returns `0` if `r` is less than `0`. This could cause issues in certain scenarios where the value of `r` is expected to be greater than `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `1` if `r` is greater than `1`, while this code fragment returns `r` if `r` is greater than `1`. This could cause issues in certain scenarios where the value of `r` is expected to be less than `1`.
