  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable and non-enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable and non-enumerable symbol-keyed properties.

DONE.
