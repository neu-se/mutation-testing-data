  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the specified index, rather than replacing the existing op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the specified index, rather than replacing the existing op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index + 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op after the existing op, rather than replacing it.

DONE.
