  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

- `!isPromise(value)`: This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function would return `false` for fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

+ `value.inspect().state`: This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function does not return the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

* `value.then(undefined, undefined)`: This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that would be fulfilled or rejected with the same value as the original promise.

DONE.
