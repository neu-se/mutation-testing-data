  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type = 'Polygon'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method would throw an error when checking the `type` property of the `point` object, since the `type` property is now set to `'Polygon'` instead of `'Point'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [0, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method would throw an error when checking the `coordinates` property of the `point` object, since the `coordinates` property is now set to `[0, 0]` instead of an array with two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method would throw an error when checking the `latitude` property of the `point` object, since the `latitude` property is now set
