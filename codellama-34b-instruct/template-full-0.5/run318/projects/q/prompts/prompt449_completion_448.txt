  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Promise(() => {})` returns a promise that is never resolved or rejected, which would cause the promise to be pending indefinitely.

DONE.
