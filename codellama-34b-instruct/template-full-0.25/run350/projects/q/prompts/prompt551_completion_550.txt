  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the promise, rather than the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the promise plus one, rather than the value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the promise multiplied by two, rather than the value itself.

DONE.
