  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` is a different method than `console.log`, and it may not have the same side effects or produce the same output as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.toString()` is a different method than `console.log`, and it may not have the same side effects or produce the same output as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a different method than `console.log`, and it may not have the same side effects or produce the same output as the original code fragment.

DONE.
