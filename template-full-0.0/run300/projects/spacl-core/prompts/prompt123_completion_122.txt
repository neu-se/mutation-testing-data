  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the pattern matches the given string or not, whereas `this.regex` returns the regular expression object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.exec(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec()` method returns an array of matches, whereas `this.regex` returns the regular expression object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.match(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match()` method returns an array of matches, whereas `this.regex` returns the regular expression object itself.

DONE.
