Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an event with an additional argument `1`, which may not be expected by the event listeners, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the event with `null` as an argument, which could cause listeners that expect a valid value to malfunction or throw errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the event with `undefined`, which may lead to unexpected results in the event listeners that rely on a specific value being passed.

DONE.
