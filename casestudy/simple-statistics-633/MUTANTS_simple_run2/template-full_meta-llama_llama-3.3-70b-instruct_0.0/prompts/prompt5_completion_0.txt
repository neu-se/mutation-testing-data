Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof x[i] === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when the current element is a number, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when the index of the current element is even, regardless of the type or value of the element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x[i] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when the current element is null, whereas the original code checks for non-numeric types, which includes but is not limited to null.

DONE.
