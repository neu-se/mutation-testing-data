 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return read; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the initial value of `read`, instead of recursively applying `pull` with the new arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pull.bind(null, read)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with `read` pre-filled as the first argument, causing the recursive call to ignore additional arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { pull.apply(null, arguments); }
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` would be used instead of the `ref` array, causing the recursive call to ignore the initial `read` value and potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
