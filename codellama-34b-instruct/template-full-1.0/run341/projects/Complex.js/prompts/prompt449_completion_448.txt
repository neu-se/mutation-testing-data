  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im'] * places)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs()` function would ensure that the result is always positive, whereas the original code fragment would handle both positive and negative values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable is squared, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment, which uses it as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator negates the output of the multiplication, resulting in a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
