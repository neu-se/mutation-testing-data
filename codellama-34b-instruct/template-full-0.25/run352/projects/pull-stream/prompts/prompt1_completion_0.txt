  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the first element of the `sources` object, instead of all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Object.keys(sources)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the first key of the `sources` object, instead of all keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = sources[Object.keys(sources)[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the first value of the `sources` object, instead of all values.

DONE.
