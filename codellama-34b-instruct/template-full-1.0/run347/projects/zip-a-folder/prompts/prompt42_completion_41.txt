  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a method that adds a file to the archive, while `glob` is a method that adds files that match a glob pattern to the archive. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `file`, the code would only add a single file to the archive, instead of all the files matching the glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory
```
This would result in different behavior because `directory` is a method that adds a directory and all its contents to the archive, while `glob` is a method that adds files that match a glob pattern to the archive. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `directory`, the code would add all the files in the directory and its subdirectories to the archive, instead of just the files matching the glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.entries
```
This would result in different behavior
