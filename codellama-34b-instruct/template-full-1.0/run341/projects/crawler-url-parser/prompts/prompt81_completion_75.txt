  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for the location of the image or other media, not for linking to other web pages.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'title'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `title` attribute is used for the title of the link, not for the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'alt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `alt` attribute is used for the alternative text for the link, not for the URL.

DONE.
