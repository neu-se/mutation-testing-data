  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isPoint = (object: any) => object && typeof object === 'object' && object.type === 'Point';
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `isObject` function to check if the input is a `Point` object instead of a generic object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isObject = (object: any) => object && typeof object === 'object' && 'latitude' in object && 'longitude' in object;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `isObject` function to check if the input has both `latitude` and `longitude` properties, regardless of the `type` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isObject = (object: any) => object && typeof object === 'object' && Object.values(object).includes('geoPoint');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `isObject` function to check if the input
