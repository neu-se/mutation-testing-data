  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `source` property of the `promise` object to the `p` variable, rather than the `promise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `promise` object, rather than assigning the `promise` object to the `p` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `null`, rather than assigning the `promise` object to the `p` variable.

DONE.
