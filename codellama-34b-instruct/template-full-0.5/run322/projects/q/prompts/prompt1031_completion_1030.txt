  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `nodeback` function would be `undefined` instead of `null`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the `nodeback` function would be reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `nodeback` function would be `undefined` instead of `value`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
