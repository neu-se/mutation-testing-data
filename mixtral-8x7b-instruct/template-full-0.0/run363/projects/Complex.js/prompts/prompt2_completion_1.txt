 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement `Math.abs(<PLACEHOLDER>) < 1e-9` would always return `true`, causing the function to return the approximate value of `e^x - 1` instead of the Taylor series approximation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to always return `Infinity`, which would affect the behavior of the `cosm1` function and potentially other parts of the code that rely on the correct behavior of `cosh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-x
