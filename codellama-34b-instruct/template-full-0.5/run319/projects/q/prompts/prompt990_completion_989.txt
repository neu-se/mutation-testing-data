  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return the first argument of the function, whereas `arguments` would return the entire arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return the first two arguments of the function, whereas `arguments` would return the entire arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 3)` would return the first three arguments of the function, whereas `arguments` would return the entire arguments object.

DONE.
