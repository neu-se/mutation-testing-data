  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, potentially returning a different subset of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, potentially returning a different subset of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, potentially returning a different subset of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
