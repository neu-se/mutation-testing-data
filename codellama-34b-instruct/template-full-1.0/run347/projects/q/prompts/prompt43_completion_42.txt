  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would delay the execution of `flush` for 1 millisecond instead of 0 milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.bind(window, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that would delay the execution of `flush` until the next cycle of the event loop, instead of executing it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would delay the execution of `flush` until the next cycle of the event loop, instead of executing it immediately.

DONE.
