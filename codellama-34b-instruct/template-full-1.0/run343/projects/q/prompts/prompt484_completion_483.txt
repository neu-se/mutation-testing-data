  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a mutator method that changes the contents of the array, while `slice` is an accessor method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` is a mutator method that reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `slice` is an accessor method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a mutator method that removes the first element from the array and returns it, while `slice` is an accessor method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
