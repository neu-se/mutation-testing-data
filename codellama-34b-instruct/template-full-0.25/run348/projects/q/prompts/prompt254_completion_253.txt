  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `messages` array to the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `messages` array to the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `messages` array starting from the second element, instead of passing the entire array.

DONE.
