  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or skip over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other iteration, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or skip over certain iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the value of `i` to 0 every time it is executed, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or skip over certain iterations.

DONE.
