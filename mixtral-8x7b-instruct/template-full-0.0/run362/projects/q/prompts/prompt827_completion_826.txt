 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would be replaced with an empty function, which would prevent the error from being handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would be replaced with `null`, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown when the `onUnhandledError` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.onunhandledrejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would be replaced with `Q.onunhandledrejection`, which is a different function that may not handle the error in the same way as `onerror`.

DONE.
