  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set()` method would throw an error, as it requires a non-null value as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set()` method would set the value of the key to an empty string, which would be a different behavior than setting it to the `currentUrl.url` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set()` method would set the value of the key to `undefined`, which would be a different behavior than setting it to the `currentUrl.url` value.

DONE.
