  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `c !== '+'`
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `+` operator to be treated as a character instead of an operator, leading to unexpected results in the final calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `c !== '-'`
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `-` operator to be treated as a character instead of an operator, leading to unexpected results in the final calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `c === '*'`
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `*` operator to be treated as a character instead of an operator, leading to unexpected results in the final calculation.

DONE.
