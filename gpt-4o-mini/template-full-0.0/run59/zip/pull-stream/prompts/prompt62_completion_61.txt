Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate immediately if `loop` is false, preventing any further iterations and potentially skipping necessary reads.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop, continuously calling `read` without any condition to break out, which could lead to a stack overflow or unresponsive behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue as long as `abort` is truthy, which may not be the intended logic, potentially leading to premature termination of the reading process.

DONE.
