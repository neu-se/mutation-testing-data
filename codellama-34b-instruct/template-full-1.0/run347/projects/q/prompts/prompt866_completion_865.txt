  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Deferred` is a different object and would not have the same methods and properties as `defer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have any methods or properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is also not an object and does not have any methods or properties.

DONE.
