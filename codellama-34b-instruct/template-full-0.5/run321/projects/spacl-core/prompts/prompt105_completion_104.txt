  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "name", regardless of the value of the `name` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the uppercase version of the `name` variable, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the substring of the `name` variable starting from the second character, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
