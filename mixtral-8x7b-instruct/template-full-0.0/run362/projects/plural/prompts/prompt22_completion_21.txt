 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nuclei|syllabus|focus|fungus|cacti/
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks for the presence of "nuclei", "syllabus", "foci", "fungi", and "cacti" instead of "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", and "cactus".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
