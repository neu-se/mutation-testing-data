 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an empty string, instead of using the `tester` function which could have any kind of logic implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, allowing all data to pass through the filter, regardless of the test condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `read` function instead of the `tester` function, which would cause the filter to behave differently depending on the implementation of the `read` function.

DONE.
