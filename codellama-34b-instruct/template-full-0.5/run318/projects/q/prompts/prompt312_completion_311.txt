  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
