  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy and `test(data)` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy and `test(data)` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is falsy or `test(data)` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy and `test(data)` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy or `test(data)` is falsy.
