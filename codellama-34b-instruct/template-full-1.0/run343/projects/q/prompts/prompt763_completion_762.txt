  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `Q` function to each element of the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(promises).then(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wait for all promises in the `promises` array to be fulfilled and then apply the `Q` function to the array of fulfilled values, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.forEach(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `Q` function to each element of the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
