  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is being modified before being passed to the `post` method.

DONE.
