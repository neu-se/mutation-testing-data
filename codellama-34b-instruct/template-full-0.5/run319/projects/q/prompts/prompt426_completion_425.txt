  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would be called on the `value` object instead of the `promise` object, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect(value).state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would be called on the `value` object with the `value` argument, which could potentially return a different result than calling the method on the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect(promise).state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would be called on the `promise` object with the `promise` argument, which could potentially return a different result than calling the method on the `value` object.

DONE.
