  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++index` operator would be evaluated before the comparison, potentially changing the value of `index` and the result of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would be evaluated before the comparison, potentially changing the value of `index` and the result of the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 2 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 2` operator would be evaluated before the comparison, potentially changing the value of `index` and the result of the comparison.

DONE.
