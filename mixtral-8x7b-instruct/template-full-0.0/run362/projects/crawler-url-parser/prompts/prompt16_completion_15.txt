 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'#' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random fragment identifier to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'#some-fragment'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a static fragment identifier to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'?some-query=' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random query parameter to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

These changes introduce new, invalid components to the URL, which would not be present in the original URL. The tests should fail because the code's behavior has changed, and it should handle these invalid URLs gracefully (e.g., by returning
