Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a `null` value instead of calling the provided `resolver` function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.call(null, "error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the string "error" instead of executing the intended resolver function, which could disrupt the expected flow of promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the string "rejected" instead of executing the `resolver`, causing the promise to be in a rejected state without executing any resolution logic.

DONE.
