  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function() { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would throw an error, and the promise would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would return a rejected promise, and the original promise would be rejected.

DONE.
