  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` field is of type number, and the original code is checking if it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the `retain` field is an object and not null, but this new code only checks if it is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the `retain` field is an object, but this new code checks if it is not a number.

DONE.
