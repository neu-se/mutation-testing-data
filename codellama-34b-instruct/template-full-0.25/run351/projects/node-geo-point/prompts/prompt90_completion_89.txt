  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the bearing, while this replacement uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the bearing, while this replacement uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ) * sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the bearing, while this replacement uses the `tan` function to calculate the tangent of the bearing.

DONE.
