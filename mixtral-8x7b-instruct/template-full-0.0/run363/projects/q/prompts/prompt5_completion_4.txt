 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"promisfe", definition
```
This would result in different behavior because of the misspelled word "promisfe", which would not be a recognized identifier, causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"deferred", definition
```
This would result in different behavior because "deferred" is a different object in the Q library, and passing it instead of "promise" would cause the module to initialize with a different object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise, function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument, a function, is being passed instead of the definition of the module. This would cause the module to not be initialized properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
