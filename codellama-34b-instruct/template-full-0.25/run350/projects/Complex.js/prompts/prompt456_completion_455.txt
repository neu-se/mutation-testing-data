  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
    Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the test to always pass, even if the values are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
    Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the test to always fail, even if the values are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
    Math.abs
