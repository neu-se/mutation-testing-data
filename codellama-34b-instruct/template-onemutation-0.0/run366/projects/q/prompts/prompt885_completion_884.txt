  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `nodeArgs` is a reference to the original array. This means that any changes made to `nodeArgs` would not affect the original array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.
