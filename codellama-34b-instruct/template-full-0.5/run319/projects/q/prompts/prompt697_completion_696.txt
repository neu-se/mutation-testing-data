  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(arguments, 1)` which slices the `arguments` array from the first element (index 1) to the end, while this new code slices it from the second element (index 2) to the end, which would exclude the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(arguments, 1)` which slices the `arguments` array from the first element (index 1) to the end, while this new code slices it from the beginning (index 0) to the second element (index 1), which would include only the first two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different
