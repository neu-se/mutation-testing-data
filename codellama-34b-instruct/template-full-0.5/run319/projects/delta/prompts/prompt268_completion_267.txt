  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, rather than just the `otherOp.insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array with an additional character appended to the `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength - 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array with one less character in the `insert` property.

DONE.
