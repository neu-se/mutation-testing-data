  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would then pass the rejection instead of the fulfillment to the `then` method's callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trace.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `trace.message` is not a function, so it would throw an error when the `then` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would then resolve with `resolve` instead of the original result, which would affect the subsequent promise chain.

DONE.
