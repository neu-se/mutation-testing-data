  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, which would lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be randomly modified, leading to unpredictable and inconsistent results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be doubled, leading to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

DONE.
