  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value for a given key, but the key `currentUrl.url` is already present in the map, so it would overwrite the existing value with the new one, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a method that adds a new entry to the map, but the key `currentUrl.url` is already present in the map, so it would throw an exception because the key already exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.put(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `put` is a method that sets a value for a given key, and if the key already exists, it overwrites the existing value
