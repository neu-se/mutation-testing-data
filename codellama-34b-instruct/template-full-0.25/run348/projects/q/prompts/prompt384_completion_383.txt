  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `thenResolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with `value` as an argument, but the promise would be resolved with the return value of the callback, which is `value` in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { return Q.reject(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with `value` as an argument, but the promise would be rejected with the return value of the callback, which is `Q.reject(value)` in this case.

DONE.
