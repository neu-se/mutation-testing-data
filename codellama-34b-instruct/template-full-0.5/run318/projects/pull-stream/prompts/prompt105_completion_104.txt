  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `null` is an object. In the original code, `null` is being passed as an argument to the `drain` function, and if the function expects a primitive value, it may not handle `null` correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different primitive value than `null`. In the original code, `null` is being passed as an argument to the `drain` function, and if the function expects a non-zero value, it may not handle `0` correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number". It is different from `null` and `undefined`, and it may cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

DONE.
