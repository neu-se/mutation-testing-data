 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for loose equality instead of strict equality, which might not behave as expected in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the reciprocal of `b` is equal to 0, which would cause a division by zero error if `b` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is not equal to 0 twice, which would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is not 0, and never evaluate to `true` if `b` is 0.

DONE.
