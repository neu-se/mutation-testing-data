  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the contents of the file without modifying it, while this change would add 1 to the content before parsing it as JSON.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the contents of the file without modifying it, while this change would multiply the content by 2 before parsing it as JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the contents of the file without modifying it, while this change would reverse the order of the content before parsing it as JSON.

DONE.
