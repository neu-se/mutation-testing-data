  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is a string, to check if the current URL is relative. Replacing it with the string "null" would cause the code to check if the current URL is relative to the URL "null", which would likely return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of the `baseUrlStr` variable to check if the current URL is relative. Replacing it with the null value would cause the code to check if the current URL is relative to null, which would likely return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of the `baseUrlStr` variable to check if the current URL is relative. Replacing it with the undefined value would cause the code to check
