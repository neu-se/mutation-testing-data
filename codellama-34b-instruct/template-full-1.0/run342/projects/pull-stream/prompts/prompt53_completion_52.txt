  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s || typeof s === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator has higher precedence than &&, so the expression would evaluate to true if s is truthy or if typeof s is equal to 'object'. In the original code, the expression would only evaluate to true if s is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the && operator has higher precedence than the equality operator, so the expression would evaluate to true if s is truthy and typeof s is equal to 'function'. In the original code, the expression would only evaluate to true if s is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the !== operator checks for strict inequality, so the expression would evaluate to true if s is not equal to the string 'object'. In the original code, the expression would only evaluate to true if
