 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peek()!
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `peekType` method to be called on a potentially `null` or `undefined` value, potentially causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType!()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `peekType` property as a function, which would throw a runtime error as it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter['peek']!()
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `peek` property as if it were a method, which would throw a runtime error as it is not a method.

DONE.
