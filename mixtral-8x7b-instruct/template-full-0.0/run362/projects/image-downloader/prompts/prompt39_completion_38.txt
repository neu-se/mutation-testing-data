 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value is now `null`, whereas the original code resolves with an object containing the `filename` property. This change could expose issues in the test suite related to checking the resolved value's structure and properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => resolve({ filename: dest }), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolution is now delayed, which could expose issues in the test suite related to synchronous expectations or time-dependent tests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('An unexpected error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown instead of resolving the promise. This change could expose issues in the test suite related to error handling and exception testing.

DONE.
