  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `===` checks for both value and type equality, whereas `==` only checks for value equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `===` checks for both value and type equality, whereas `==` only checks for value equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `===` checks for both value and type equality, whereas `==` only checks for value equality.

DONE.
