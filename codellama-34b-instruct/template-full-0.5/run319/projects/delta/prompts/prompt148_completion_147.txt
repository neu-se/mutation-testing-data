  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which could lead to a different iteration order or result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which could lead to a different iteration order or result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called twice, with the second call using the result of the first call as its argument. This could lead to a different iteration order or result.

DONE.
