  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is exactly 2, while the modified code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is exactly 2, while the modified code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is greater than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is exactly 2, while the modified code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is exactly 1.

DONE.
