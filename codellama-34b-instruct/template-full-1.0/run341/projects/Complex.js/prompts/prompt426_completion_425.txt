  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square of `a`, which may not always be the same as `a * a`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of `a`, which may not always be the same as `a * a`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a % 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the remainder of `a` when divided by 2, which may not always be the same as `a * a`.

DONE.
