  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` would cause the promise to be resolved, but the function passed to `Q.then` would return a rejected promise, causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
