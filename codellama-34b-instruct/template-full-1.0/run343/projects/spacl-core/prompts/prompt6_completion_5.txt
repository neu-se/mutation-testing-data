  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match an empty string instead of a string that starts with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a string that starts with a slash, but also contains other characters before the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a string that starts with a slash, but also contains other characters that may not be valid in a URL path.

DONE.
