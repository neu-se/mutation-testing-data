  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, and it has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx) || policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This code fragment is a modification of the original code fragment, and it has different behavior. The `||` operator is used to combine the result of two `matches` method calls, which can lead to different results than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx) && policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This code fragment is also a modification of the original code fragment, and it has different behavior. The `&&` operator is used to combine the result of two `matches` method calls, which can lead to different results than the original code fragment.

DONE.
