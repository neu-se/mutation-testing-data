  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Math.max()`
This would result in different behavior because when `Math.pow()` is used, the result is a power operation, while `Math.max()` returns the maximum of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Math.min()`
This would result in different behavior because when `Math.pow()` is used, the result is a power operation, while `Math.min()` returns the minimum of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Math.round()`
This would result in different behavior because when `Math.pow()` is used, the result is a power operation, while `Math.round()` rounds a number to the nearest integer.

DONE.
