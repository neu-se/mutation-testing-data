  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` and the `else` block would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end === true` is only true if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `end` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end !== true` is only true if `end` is not strictly equal to `true`, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `end` is not strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
