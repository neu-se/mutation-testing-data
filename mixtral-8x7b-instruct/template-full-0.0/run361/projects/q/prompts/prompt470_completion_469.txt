 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function expects at least two arguments, and passing `null` as the second argument would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function expects a string as the first argument, and an object `{}` would not be a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function expects the second argument to be the promise object, but instead it would receive the rejected reason.

DONE.
