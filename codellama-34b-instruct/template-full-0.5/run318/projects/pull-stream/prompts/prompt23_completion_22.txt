  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `ref[1]` is not necessarily the same as `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `ref[0] + 1` is not necessarily the same as `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `ref[0] - 1` is not necessarily the same as `ref[0]`.

DONE.
