  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `newOp.retain` to a number, while this code sets it to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `newOp.retain` to a number, while this code sets it to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `newOp.retain` to a number, while this code sets it to `Infinity`.

DONE.
