  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(callback));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the `callback` function as a parameter to `makeNodeResolver`, which is not the intention of the original code. The `callback` function should not be invoked immediately, but rather passed as a parameter to `makeNodeResolver` so that it can be called later when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {
    return deferred.reject(new Error("failure"));
}));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be creating a new function that always rejects the promise with a "failure" error when invoked, rather than using the original `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(Q.resolve(deferred.makeNodeResolver(callback)));
```
This would result in different behavior
