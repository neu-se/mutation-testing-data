 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` only returns enumerable and non-enumerable own properties, while `Object.keys` returns only enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(a => Object.keys(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps `Object.keys` in a function, which would not directly apply to the `attributes` object. The original code fragment uses `Object.keys` directly on the `attributes` object.

DONE.
