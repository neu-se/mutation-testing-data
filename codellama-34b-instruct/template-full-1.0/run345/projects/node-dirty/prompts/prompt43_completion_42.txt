  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, val]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `forEach` would receive an array of key-value pairs instead of a key and a value, which could cause the function to break or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `forEach` would receive a key and a value that are different from the original key-value pair, which could cause the function to break or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1, val
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `forEach` would receive a key that is one higher than the original key, which could cause the function to break or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
