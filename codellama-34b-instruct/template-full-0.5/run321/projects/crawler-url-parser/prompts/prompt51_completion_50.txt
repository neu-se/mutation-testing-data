  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol of the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the host of the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect results in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the pathname of the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect results in the `parse` function.

DONE.
