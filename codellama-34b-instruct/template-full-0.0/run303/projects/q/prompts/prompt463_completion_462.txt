  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track unhandled rejections differently than the original code, which could lead to different results in the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of the array itself, which could lead to different results in the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `unhandledRejections` array, which could lead to different results in the `untrackRejection` function.

DONE.
