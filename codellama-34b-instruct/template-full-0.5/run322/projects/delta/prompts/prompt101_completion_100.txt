  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `ops` array, rather than the first element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `ops` array, rather than the last element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `ops` array, rather than the last element as intended, and it would also return an array of the removed elements, which is not necessary in this context.

DONE.
