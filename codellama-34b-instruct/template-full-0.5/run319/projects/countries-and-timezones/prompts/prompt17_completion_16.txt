  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"id"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string "id" instead of the actual id of the country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the id of the country plus one instead of the actual id of the country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the id of the country minus one instead of the actual id of the country.

DONE.
