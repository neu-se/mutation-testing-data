  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.abs` to get the absolute value of a number, while the mutated code fragment uses the negative of `Math.abs`, which will give a different result when the number is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.abs` to get the absolute value of a number, while the mutated code fragment uses `Math.ceil` to round the number up to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.abs` to get the absolute value of a number, while the mutated code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the number down to the nearest integer.

DONE.
