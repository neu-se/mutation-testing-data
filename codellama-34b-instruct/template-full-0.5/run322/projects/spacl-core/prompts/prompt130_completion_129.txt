  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index < count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, which would cause the loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would include the count as a valid index, which would cause the loop to iterate one extra time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would exclude the last element in the array, which would cause the loop to iterate one less time.

DONE.
