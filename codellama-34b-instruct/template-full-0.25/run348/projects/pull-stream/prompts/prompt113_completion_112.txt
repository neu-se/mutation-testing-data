  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the `err` and `acc` arguments if `err` is truthy, but this new code fragment always calls the callback with `null` as the first argument and `acc` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the `err` and `acc` arguments if `err` is truthy, but this new code fragment always calls the callback with `err` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with the `err` and `acc` arguments in that order, but this
