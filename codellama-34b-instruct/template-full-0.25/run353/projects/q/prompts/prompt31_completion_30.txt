  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` expects an index as an argument, but `0` is not a valid index in this case. The code would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` expects an index as an argument, and `1` is a valid index in this case. However, it would remove the first element from the queue, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the queue, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
