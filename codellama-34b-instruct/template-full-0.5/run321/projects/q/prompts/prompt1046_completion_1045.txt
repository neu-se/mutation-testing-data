  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `closed.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve(error)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the error value, whereas `closed.resolve` would cause it to be resolved with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject(error)` would cause the promise to be rejected with the error value, whereas `closed.resolve` would cause it to be resolved with no value.

DONE.
