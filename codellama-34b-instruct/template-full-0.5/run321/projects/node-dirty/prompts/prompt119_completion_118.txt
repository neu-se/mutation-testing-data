  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.length` would always return a number, while `!this._queue.size` would return a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size === 0` would check if the size of the queue is 0, while `!this._queue.size` would check if the size of the queue is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.isEmpty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.isEmpty()` would check if the queue is empty, while `!this._queue.size` would check if the size of the queue is falsy.

DONE.
