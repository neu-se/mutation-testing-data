  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the difference between the two longitudes, while this replacement code fragment calculates the sum of the two longitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the difference between the two longitudes, while this replacement code fragment calculates the product of the two longitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude / point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the difference between the two longitudes, while this replacement code fragment calculates the quotient of the two longitudes.

DONE.
