  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks the prototype chain, while `constructor` checks for the exact constructor function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getPrototypeOf()` returns the prototype of an object, while `instanceof` checks the prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a property that is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, so it would return `undefined` for all promises.

DONE.
