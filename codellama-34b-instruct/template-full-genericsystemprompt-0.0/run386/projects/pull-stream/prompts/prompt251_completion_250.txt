  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would not be called, which could cause the program to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` signal would not be passed to the `read` function, which could cause the program to continue reading from the stream even if it has been aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be replaced with a new function that does nothing, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
