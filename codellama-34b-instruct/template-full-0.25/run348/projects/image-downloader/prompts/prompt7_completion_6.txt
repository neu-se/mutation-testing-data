  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `extractFilename`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `extractFilename`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so if `extractFilename` is `false`, the expression would evaluate to `false` without evaluating the second operand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so if `extractFilename` is `true`, the expression would evaluate to `true` without evaluating the second operand.

DONE.
