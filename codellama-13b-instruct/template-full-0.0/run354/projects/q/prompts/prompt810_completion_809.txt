  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = deprecate(allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to be deprecated, which would prevent it from being used in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled = allSettled;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` function to be assigned to the `Q.allSettled` property, which would make it available for use in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fail = function (object, rejected) {
    return Q(object).then(void 0, rejected);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fail` function to be assigned to the `Q.fail` property, which would make it available for use in the code.
