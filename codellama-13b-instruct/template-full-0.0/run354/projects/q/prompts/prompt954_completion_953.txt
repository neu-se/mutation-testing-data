  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve it. This would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected, which could have unintended consequences in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown instead of the original code. This could cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which could be useful for testing error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with a `null` argument instead of the original code. This could cause the promise to be rejected with a `null` value, which could be useful for testing error handling.

DONE.
