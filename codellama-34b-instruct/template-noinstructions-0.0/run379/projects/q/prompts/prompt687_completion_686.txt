  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `arguments, 1` which would pass the second argument of the `Q.try` function to the `array_slice` function, while the new code fragment would pass the third argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `arguments, 1` which would pass the second argument of the `Q.try` function to the `array_slice` function, while the new code fragment would pass the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `arguments, 1` which would pass the second argument of the `Q.try` function to the `array_slice` function, while the new code fragment would pass the fourth argument.

DONE.
