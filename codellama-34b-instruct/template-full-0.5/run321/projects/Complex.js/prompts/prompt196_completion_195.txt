  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `log(b)` is a different function than `b`.

DONE.
