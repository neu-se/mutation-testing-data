  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezonesMap` expects a single argument, but `data.timezones` is an object with multiple properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones.all)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones.all` is an array of all timezones, but `getTimezonesMap` expects an object with properties `c` and `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones[id]` is a single timezone object, but `getTimezonesMap` expects an object with properties `c` and `a`.

DONE.
