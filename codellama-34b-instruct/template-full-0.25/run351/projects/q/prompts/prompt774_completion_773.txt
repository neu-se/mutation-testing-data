  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first promise in the array, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the promises in the array, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function(promise) { return promise.isFulfilled(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include promises that have already been fulfilled, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

DONE.
