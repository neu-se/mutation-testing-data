  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` parameter is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` parameter is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` parameter is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `false`.

DONE.
