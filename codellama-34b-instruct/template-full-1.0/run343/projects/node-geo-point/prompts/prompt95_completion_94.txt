  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the sinus function on the latitude value, while the modified code uses the sinus function on the first latitude value, which could be a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the cosine function on the longitude value, while the modified code uses the cosine function on the second latitude value, which could be a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the arctangent function on the results of the previous calculations, while the modified code uses the arctangent function on the y and x values directly, which could result in a different angle.

DONE.
