Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes `nodeArgs` directly to `fapply`, which may not include the necessary context for the function call, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply.call(this, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `call` to invoke `fapply` with the current context (`this`), which may not be appropriate for the intended function binding, altering the execution context of the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply.apply(null, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `apply` with `null` as the context, which means the function will not be bound to `thisp`, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when the function relies on its context.

DONE.
