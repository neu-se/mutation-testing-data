  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string to the props array, instead of just the part after the colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string without the colon, instead of just the part after the colon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1, -1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string without the first and last characters, instead of just the part after the colon.

DONE.
