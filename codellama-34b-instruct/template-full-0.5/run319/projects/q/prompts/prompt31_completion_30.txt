  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method without an argument removes the last element of the array, while the `pop` method with an argument removes the element at the specified index. In this case, the `pop` method with an argument would remove the first element of the `laterQueue` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of the array, while the `pop` method removes the last element. In this case, the `shift` method would remove the first element of the `laterQueue` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes the first element of the array
