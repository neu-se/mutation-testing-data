  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) +1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is not being called, it will instead return a random number between 1 and 3.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(gettype(linkurl, pageurl) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is being called with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(gettype(pageurl, linkurl) * gettype(linkurl, baseUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is being called with the arguments in a different order, and with different variables.
