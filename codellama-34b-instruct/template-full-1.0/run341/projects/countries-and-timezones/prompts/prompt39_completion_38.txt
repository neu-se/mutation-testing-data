  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.countries)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, whereas `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries).map(key => data.countries[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `reduce()` to create a new object with the country names as keys, whereas this option uses `map()` to create an array of country names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(data.countries).map(entry => entry[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of [key, value] pairs for the object's own enumerable properties, whereas the original code fragment uses `Object.keys()` to get the keys and
