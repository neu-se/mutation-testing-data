  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the real part of the complex number instead of using the real part as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the real part of the complex number by 2 instead of using the real part as is.

DONE.
