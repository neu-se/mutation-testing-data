  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -3
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -4
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different substring.

DONE.
