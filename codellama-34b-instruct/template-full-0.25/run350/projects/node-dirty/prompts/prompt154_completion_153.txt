  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a placeholder, which would be replaced with a boolean value indicating whether the stream should be uncorked. However, the new code fragment uses the `true` keyword directly, which would always uncork the stream regardless of the value of the placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a placeholder, which would be replaced with a boolean value indicating whether the stream should be uncorked. However, the new code fragment uses the `false` keyword directly, which would never uncork the stream regardless of the value of the placeholder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._queue.size > 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a placeholder, which would
