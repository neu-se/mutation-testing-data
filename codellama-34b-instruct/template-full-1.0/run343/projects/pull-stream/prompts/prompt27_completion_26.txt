  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.label
```
This would result in different behavior because the `label` property is not always defined on the `read` variable, and its absence would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.property
```
This would result in different behavior because the `property` property is not always defined on the `read` variable, and its absence would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.method()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `method` property is not always defined on the `read` variable, and its absence would cause an error.

DONE.
