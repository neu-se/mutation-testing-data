  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `domain`, which means that the code inside the `if` statement would be executed even if `domain` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the code inside the `if` statement would only be executed if `domain` is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the code inside the `if` statement would be executed if `domain` is not strictly equal to `null`.

DONE.
