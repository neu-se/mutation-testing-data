  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value, causing the `inspect` method to return a different promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value, causing the `inspect` method to return a different promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise / 0;
```
This would result in different behavior, causing the `inspect` method to throw an exception, and the `allSettled` method to reject the returned promise instead of resolving with an array of promise states.

DONE.
