  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the promise object to the `fail` method, instead of the rejection reason, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the error object to the `fail` method, instead of the rejection reason, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `fail` method, which would allow the promise to be fulfilled, instead of being rejected, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
