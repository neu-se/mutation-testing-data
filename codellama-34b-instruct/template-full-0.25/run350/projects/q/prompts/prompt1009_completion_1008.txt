  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a different length, which could affect the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a negative length, which could cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
