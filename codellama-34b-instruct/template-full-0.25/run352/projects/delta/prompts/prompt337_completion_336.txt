  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different slice of the base delta, potentially omitting the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a slice of the base delta that includes one more element than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a slice of the base delta that starts one element later than the original code.

DONE.
