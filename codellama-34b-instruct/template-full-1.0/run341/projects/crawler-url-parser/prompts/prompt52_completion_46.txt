  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object, causing the function to return `null` and fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
constant
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` expects a string value, not a constant value, and would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkUrlStr` is a string value and would be passed to `URL.parse()` as the first argument, which is the URL to be parsed. This would cause `URL.parse()` to parse the `linkUrlStr` as a URL, but with different behavior than the original code because it is not called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
