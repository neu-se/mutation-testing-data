  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `.reject` is a method that creates a rejected promise, whereas `promise` is an object that potentially contains a fulfilled promise (assuming the code is correctly structured).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.__proto__
```
This would result in different behavior because `__proto__` is a property of the Object prototype, whereas `promise` is an object that potentially contains a fulfilled promise or a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return promise; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new function that returns the original `promise` object, whereas the original code fragment would return the `promise` object itself.

DONE.
