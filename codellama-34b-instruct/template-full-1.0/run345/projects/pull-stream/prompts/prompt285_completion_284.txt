  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (data != null) cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` condition is not evaluated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with a different argument.

DONE.
