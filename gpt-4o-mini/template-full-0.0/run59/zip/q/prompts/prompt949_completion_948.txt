Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments, rather than passing the arguments as an array, which may lead to incorrect handling of the arguments in the context of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the `this` context means that the callback will not have the intended `thisp` context, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors if the callback relies on `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(thisp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value (`thisp`), but does not invoke the function immediately, which is different from the original behavior that executes the callback immediately with the provided arguments.

DONE.
