  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `data` variable, which would change the value of the variable and potentially cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would convert the `data` variable to a string, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the string is not a valid JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `data` variable would return the length of the string, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the string is not a valid JSON string.

DONE.
