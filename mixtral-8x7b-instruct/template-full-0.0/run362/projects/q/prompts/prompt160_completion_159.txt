 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{value: stack.split(''), configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the stack trace into an array of characters, which would not be equivalent to the original string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{value: 42, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the stack trace with the number 42, which is not a stack trace and would not provide the same information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{value: function() { throw new Error('Mutated stack trace') }, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the stack trace with a function that throws an error, which would not provide the same information as the original stack trace.

DONE.
