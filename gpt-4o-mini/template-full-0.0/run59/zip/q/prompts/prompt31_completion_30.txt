Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `laterQueue.pop()` method to always return `undefined`, leading to the `runSingle(task)` function being called with `undefined` instead of a valid task, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to pop an element from the `laterQueue` array at index `1`, which may not exist if the array has fewer than two elements, resulting in `undefined` being passed to `runSingle(task)` and potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to pop an element from the `laterQueue` array at the index equal to its current length, which is out of bounds and would return `undefined`, leading to an error when `runSingle(task)` is called with `undefined`.

DONE.
