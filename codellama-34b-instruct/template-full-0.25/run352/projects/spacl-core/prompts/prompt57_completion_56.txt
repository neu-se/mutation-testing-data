Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for `.` and `$`, whereas the original code fragment would match any character except for `/`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for `.` and `$`, whereas the original code fragment would match any character except for `/`.
