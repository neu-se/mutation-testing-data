  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error || !"string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been added before the `typeof` operator, which would negate the result of the check for the type of `error`. If `error` is an object, the `typeof` operator would return `"object"`, which would then be negated to `false`, resulting in the `reject()` method being called instead of the `resolve()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable has been removed from the expression, and the `||` operator has been changed to an `&&` operator. If `error` is an object, the expression would return `false`, and the `reject()` method would be called instead of the `resolve()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different
