  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer update the `acc` variable with the reduced value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `data` variable to the `acc` variable, rather than reducing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `acc` variable to the `data` variable, rather than reducing it.

DONE.
