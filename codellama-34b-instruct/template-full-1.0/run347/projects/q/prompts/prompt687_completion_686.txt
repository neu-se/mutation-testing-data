  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special variable that contains the arguments passed to a function, while `arguments, 1` would be a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...arguments, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[...arguments, 1]` would create a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` with the value 1 appended to the end, while `arguments, 1` would be a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would create a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` starting from the first element, while `arguments, 1` would be a syntax error.

DONE.
