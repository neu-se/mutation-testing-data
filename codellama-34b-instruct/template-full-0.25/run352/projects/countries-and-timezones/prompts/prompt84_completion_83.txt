  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` is a string, and the new code fragment `c.toUpperCase()` is a string in all uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` is a string, and the new code fragment `c.length` is the length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` is a string, and the new code fragment `c.split('')` is an array of strings, where each string is a single character from the original string.

DONE.
