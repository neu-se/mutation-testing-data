  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, since the `index` variable would be incremented by 1 and then checked against the loop condition, which is `index < count`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, since the `index` variable would be decremented by 1 and then checked against the loop condition, which is `index < count`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = count - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, since the `index` variable would be set to `count - 1` and then checked against the loop condition, which is `index < count`.

DONE.
