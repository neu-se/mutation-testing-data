  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed an error object to the callback function if the key was not found, while this modified code fragment passes a null value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Key not found'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed an error object to the callback function if the key was not found, while this modified code fragment passes a new error object with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed an error object to the callback function if the key was not found, while this modified code fragment passes the value of the key instead.

DONE.
