 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the `throughs` object by 2, which is not equivalent to including the properties of `throughs` in the `exports` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, throughs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `throughs` object and assigns it to `exports`, which may not have the same behavior as including the properties of `throughs` in the `exports` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `throughs` object with its `hasOwnProperty` method, which is a function and not an object with properties.

DONE.
