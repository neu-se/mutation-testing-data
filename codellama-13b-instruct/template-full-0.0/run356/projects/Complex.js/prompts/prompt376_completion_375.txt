  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the value of `d` as `2 * a`, while the modified code fragment calculates it as `2 * a + 1`. This would change the result of the calculation and potentially introduce a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the value of `d` as `2 * a`, while the modified code fragment calculates it as `a - 1`. This would change the result of the calculation and potentially introduce a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the value of `d` as `2 * a`, while the modified code fragment calculates it as `a * b`. This would change the result of the calculation and potentially introduce a bug.

DONE.
