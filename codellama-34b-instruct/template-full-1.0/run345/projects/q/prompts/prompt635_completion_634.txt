  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in an error because `dispatch` expects the first argument to be a string, but `undefined` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in an error because `dispatch` expects the first argument to be a string, but `null` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in an error because `dispatch` expects the first argument to be a string, but `42` is not a string.

DONE.
