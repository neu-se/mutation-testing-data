  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `inspect` method of `value` whereas the original code fragment just accesses the `inspect` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value['inspect']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `inspect` property of `value` using bracket notation instead of dot notation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `inspect` property of `value` using dot notation and then calls the property as a function.

DONE.
