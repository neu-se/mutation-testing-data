  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is less than 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value when `b` is 0 and `a` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value when `b` is 0 and `a` is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && Math.abs(a) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0
