 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional block would no longer execute, and unhandled rejections would not be tracked or reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional block would evaluate to `false`, and unhandled rejections would not be tracked or reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional block would evaluate to `false`, and unhandled rejections would not be tracked or reported.

DONE.
