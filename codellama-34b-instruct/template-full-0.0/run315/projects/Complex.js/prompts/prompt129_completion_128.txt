  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, but this replacement code fragment checks if `z` is infinite or if `z` is infinite. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where `z` is not infinite, but `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, but this replacement code fragment checks if `z` is infinite and `z` is infinite. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where `z` is not infinite, but `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
