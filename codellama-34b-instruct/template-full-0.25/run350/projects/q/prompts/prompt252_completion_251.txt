  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the second argument to `apply`, which would cause the function to be called with no arguments.

DONE.
