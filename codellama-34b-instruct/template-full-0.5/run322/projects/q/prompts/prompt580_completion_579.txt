  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function with the `this` value set to `continuer`, and the first argument set to `"throw"`. This would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `this` value set to `continuer` and the first argument set to `"throw"`, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function with the `this` value set to `continuer`, and the first argument set to `"next"`. This would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `this` value set to `continuer` and the first argument set to `"next"`, which would likely result in a different
