  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` on `arguments`, which is an array-like object but not an array itself. This would cause the `concat` method to fail, as it expects an array as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat(array_slice(args))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` on `args`, which is an array, and `concat` would work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly concatenate the `args` array to `baseArgs`, without using `array_slice` at all.

DONE.
