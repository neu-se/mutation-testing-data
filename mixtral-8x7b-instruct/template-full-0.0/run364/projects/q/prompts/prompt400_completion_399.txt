 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.thenResolve` function would always return a promise that is immediately resolved with `undefined`, regardless of the input promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenResolve` would always return a pending promise, even if the input promise is already fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Bug'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenResolve` would always return a rejected promise, regardless of the input promise.

DONE.
