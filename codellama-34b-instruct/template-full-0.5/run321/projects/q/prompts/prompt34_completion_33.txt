  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is now null, which would cause the `runSingle` function to throw an error when trying to access the `task.domain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.domain = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task.domain` property is now undefined, which would cause the `runSingle` function to throw an error when trying to access the `domain.enter()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.domain = { enter: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task.domain` property now has a null `enter` method, which would cause the `runSingle` function to throw an error when trying to call the `domain.enter()` method.

DONE.
