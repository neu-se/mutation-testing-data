  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.hostname` is the hostname of the parsed URL, while `parsedBaseUrl` is the parsed base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url, parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.url` is the URL of the base URL, while `parsedUrl` is the parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr` is the string representation of the base URL, while `parsedUrl.pathname` is the pathname of the parsed URL.

DONE.
