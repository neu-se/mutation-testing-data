  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a promise for the property value, even if the property does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a promise for the return value of the `set` method, even if the property does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a promise for the return value of the `delete` method, even if the property does not exist.

DONE.
