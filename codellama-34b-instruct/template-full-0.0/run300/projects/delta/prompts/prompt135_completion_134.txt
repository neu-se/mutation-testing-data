  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, while `otherIter.peek()` is a function call that returns the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next value in the iteration, while `otherIter.peek()` is a function call that returns the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength` is a function that returns the length of the next value in the iteration, while `otherIter.peek()` is a function call that returns the result of the function.

DONE.
