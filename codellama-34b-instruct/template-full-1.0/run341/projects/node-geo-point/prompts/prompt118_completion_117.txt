  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong distance, which could have a significant impact on downstream calculations. For example, if the distance between two points is important for determining the flight path of a drone, using a value that is 1 meter higher could cause the drone to crash or deviate from its intended course.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a distance that is too short, which could also have significant downstream implications. For example, if the distance between two points is used to determine the amount of fuel needed for a flight, using a value that is 1 meter shorter could result in the drone running out of fuel mid-air, causing a crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-distance
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a negative distance
