  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a - Math.sqrt(a * a - 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the square root is flipped, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + Math.sqrt(a * a + 1) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra addend of 1 is introduced, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * Math.sqrt(a * a + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root is multiplied by a, leading to a different result.

DONE.
