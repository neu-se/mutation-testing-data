  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 1 if r is greater than 1, while the new fragment returns 0 in the same case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? -1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 1 if r is greater than 1, while the new fragment returns -1 in the same case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 2 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 1 if r is greater than 1, while the new fragment returns 2 in the same case.

DONE.
