  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].bind(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments, which can change the behavior of the `generator[verb]` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].call(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` allows you to specify the `this` value and arguments for a function, which can change the behavior of the `generator[verb]` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].apply(generator, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` allows you to specify the `this` value and arguments for a function, which can change the behavior of the `generator[verb]` call.

DONE.
