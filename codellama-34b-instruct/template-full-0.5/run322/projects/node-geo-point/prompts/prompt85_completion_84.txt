  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` calculation to use the wrong value for `φ1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` calculation to use a sum of the two values, rather than the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) + sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` calculation to use the sum of the sine values, rather than the product.

DONE.
