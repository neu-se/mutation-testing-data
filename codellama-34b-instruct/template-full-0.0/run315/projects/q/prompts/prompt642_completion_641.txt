  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the `args` array with itself, effectively doubling the number of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a reversed version of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause issues if the method expects the arguments to be in a specific order.

DONE.
