 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls `buildCountry` instead of memoizing the country object. This could lead to unnecessary recalculations and potential inconsistencies in the returned data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries['id'] = buildCountry(data, id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a hardcoded string 'id' as the key for the `countries` object, instead of using the actual `id` value. This would cause all countries to be stored under the same key, leading to incorrect data and unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id] = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the country object with an empty object instead of calling `buildCountry(data, id)`. This would lead to missing country properties and incorrect data, causing tests to fail or produce unexpected
