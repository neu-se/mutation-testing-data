  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a different property than `host`, and it would return the domain without the port.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host + ':1234'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the hostname with a different port.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split(':')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the port from the hostname.

DONE.
