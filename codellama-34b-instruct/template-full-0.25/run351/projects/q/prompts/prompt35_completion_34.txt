  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but the buggy code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not log a message to the console, but the buggy code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function, but the buggy code fragment returns undefined.

DONE.
