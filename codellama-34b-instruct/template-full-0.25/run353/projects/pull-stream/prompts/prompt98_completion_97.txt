  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` passes `null` as the first argument to the callback function, while the new code fragment `cb(err, null)` passes `err` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` passes `data` as the second argument to the callback function, while the new code fragment `cb(null, err)` passes `err` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` passes two arguments to the callback function, while the new code fragment `cb(err)` passes only one argument.

DONE.
