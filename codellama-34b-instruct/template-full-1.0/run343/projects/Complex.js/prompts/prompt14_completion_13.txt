  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` has a different output than `Math.cos`, which means that the resulting calculations would also be different, even if the input remains the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` has a different output than `Math.cos`, which means that the resulting calculations would also be different, even if the input remains the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` has a different output than `Math.cos`, which means that the resulting calculations would also be different, even if the input remains the same.

DONE.
