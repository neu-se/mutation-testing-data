  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.substring(1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a new string with all but the first character of `verbs`, causing the `for` loop to iterate over a different set of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.concat('a')) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new string with the concatenation of `verbs` and the string `'a'`, causing the `for` loop to iterate over a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.split(' ')) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of strings split by spaces, causing the `for` loop to iterate over a different set of values.

DONE.
