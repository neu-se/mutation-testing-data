  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index === length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never run, as the condition is initially false and would never become true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length - 1; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the array would not be processed, as the loop would terminate one iteration earlier.

DONE.
