  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(array)` is always `false` when `array` is a plain object, whereas `!Array.isArray(array)` is `true` when `array` is a plain object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length === 0` is `true` when `array` is an empty array, whereas `!Array.isArray(array)` is `true` when `array` is a plain object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof array === 'object'` is `true` when `array` is a plain object, whereas `!Array.isArray(array)` is `true` when `array` is a plain object.

DONE.
