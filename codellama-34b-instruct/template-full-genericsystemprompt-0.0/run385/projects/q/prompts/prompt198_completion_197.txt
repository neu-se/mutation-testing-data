  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the first element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array is falsy, rather than checking if the entire array is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array is falsy, rather than checking if the array itself is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.indexOf(qFileName) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `qFileName` is not present in the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array, rather than checking if the array itself is falsy.

DONE.
