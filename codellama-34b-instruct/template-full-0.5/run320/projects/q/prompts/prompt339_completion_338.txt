  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not defined in the current scope, and therefore the code would produce a `ReferenceError` instead of a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof inspect() === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not defined in the current scope, and therefore the code would produce a `ReferenceError` instead of a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not defined in the current scope, and therefore the code would produce a `ReferenceError` instead of a `TypeError`.

DONE.
