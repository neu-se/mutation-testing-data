  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first element of the rule array instead of the second element, which is the intended replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first element of the second element of the rule array, which is not the intended replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function stored in the second element of the rule array with the word as an argument, instead of simply returning the function.

DONE.
