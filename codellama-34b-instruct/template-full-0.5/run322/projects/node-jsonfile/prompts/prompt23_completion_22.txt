  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the content, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the content, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the content, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
