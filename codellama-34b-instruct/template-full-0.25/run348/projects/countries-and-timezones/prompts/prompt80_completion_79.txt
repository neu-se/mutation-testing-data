  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the timezone name into an array of substrings, and the `[0]` index would return the first substring, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different result.

DONE.
