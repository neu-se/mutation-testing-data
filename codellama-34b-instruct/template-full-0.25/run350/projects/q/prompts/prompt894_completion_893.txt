  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `nfapply` method to pass the arguments to the callback function in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element of the array, which would cause the `nfapply` method to pass fewer arguments to the callback function than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the array, which would cause the `nfapply` method to pass fewer arguments to the callback function than expected.

DONE.
