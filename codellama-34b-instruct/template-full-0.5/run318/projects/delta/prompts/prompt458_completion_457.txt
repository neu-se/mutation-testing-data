  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(Infinity);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an infinite length, which would cause the iterator to return an infinite number of operations, rather than the expected finite number of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a null length, which would cause the iterator to return an empty operation, rather than the expected finite number of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(this.index += 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with the current index plus one, which would cause the iterator to return an operation with a different index than the expected index.

DONE.
