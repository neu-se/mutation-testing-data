  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on the object from `post` to `get`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the method call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the method call with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
