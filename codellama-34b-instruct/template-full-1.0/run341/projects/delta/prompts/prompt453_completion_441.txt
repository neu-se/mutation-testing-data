  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (length < Infinity) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code had `length < Infinity` which would always be true, making the `if` condition always true. By replacing it with `if (length < Infinity)` it would only be true if the `length` variable is less than `Infinity`, which could be a valid condition in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.index < this.ops.length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code had `this.index < this.ops.length`, which would always be true if the `ops` array has at least one element. By replacing it with `if (this.index < this.ops.length)` it would only be true if the `index` variable is less than the `ops` array length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nextOp.length > 0) {
