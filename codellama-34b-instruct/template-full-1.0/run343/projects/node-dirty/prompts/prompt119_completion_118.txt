  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size == 0` and `!this._queue.size` have different logic. The former checks if the queue size is 0, while the latter checks if the queue size is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size > 0` and `!this._queue.size` have different logic. The former checks if the queue size is greater than 0, while the latter checks if the queue size is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.length` and `!this._queue.size` are not the same thing. `this._queue.length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the queue, while `
