  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `args` array, which may be needed by the `spread` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(Q(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `callback` function, which may cause it to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(Q.async)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert each element of the `args` array into a promise, which may not be necessary or desirable in all cases.

DONE.
