  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.file(src, { name: 'src' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a file to the archive with the name 'src', instead of the directory 'src'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.directory(src, false, { name: 'src' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a directory to the archive with the name 'src', instead of the directory 'src'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.directory(src, true, { name: 'src' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a directory to the archive with the name 'src', instead of the directory 'src'.

DONE.
