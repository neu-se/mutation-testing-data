  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude of the destination point, while this code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the longitude, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude of the destination point, while this code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the longitude, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude of the destination point, while this code fragment uses the `tan` function
