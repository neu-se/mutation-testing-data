  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'attributes'
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes` is a string literal, whereas `attributes` is an object property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `attributes` is an object property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null value, whereas `attributes` is an object property.

DONE.
