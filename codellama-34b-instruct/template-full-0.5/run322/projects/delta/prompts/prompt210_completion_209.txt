  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the `ops` array, which would cause the `concat` method to concatenate the `ops` arrays in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element from the `ops` array, which would cause the `concat` method to concatenate the `ops` arrays without the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element from the `ops` array, which would cause the `concat` method to concatenate the `ops` arrays without the first element.

DONE.
