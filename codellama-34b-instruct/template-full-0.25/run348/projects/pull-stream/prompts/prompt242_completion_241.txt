  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would negate the value of `data`. If `data` is truthy, the resulting value would be `false`, and if `data` is falsy, the resulting value would be `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is an addition operator, which would add `1` to the value of `data`. If `data` is a number, this would change its value, and if `data` is a string, this would concatenate the string with the character "1". This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACE
