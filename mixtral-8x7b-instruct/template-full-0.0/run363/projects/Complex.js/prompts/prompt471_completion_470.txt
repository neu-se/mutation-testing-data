 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the abstract equality comparison instead of the strict equality comparison. This means that it would consider two values equal if they are of the same type or can be converted to the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 === this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the strict equality comparison with the literal `0` instead of the property `this['im']`. This means that it would only consider two values equal if they are of the same type and have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the `re` property instead of the `im` property. This means that it would consider two complex numbers equal if their real parts are equal, regardless of their imaginary parts.

DONE.
