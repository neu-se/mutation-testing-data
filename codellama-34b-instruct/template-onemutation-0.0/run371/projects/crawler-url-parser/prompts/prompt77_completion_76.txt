  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is not called on the original `embedBaseUrlStr` variable, which is a string. Instead, it is called on the result of `URL.parse(embedBaseUrlStr)`, which is an object. This would cause the `replace` method to throw an error, as it is not defined for objects.

DONE.
