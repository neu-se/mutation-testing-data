  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` parameter is not being used in the original code, so it would be a no-op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `progress` parameter, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` if the `progress` parameter is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, "progress"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"progress"` would be passed as the `progress` parameter, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` if the `progress` parameter is not a function.

DONE.
