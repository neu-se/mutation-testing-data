  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().then(null, reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the returned promise, which changes the behavior of the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the returned promise, which changes the behavior of the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(resolve, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the returned promise, which changes the behavior of the `resolve` function.

DONE.
