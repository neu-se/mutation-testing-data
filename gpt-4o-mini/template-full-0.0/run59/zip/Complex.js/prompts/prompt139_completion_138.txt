Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate as true, leading to the return of `Complex['INFINITY']` regardless of whether `z` is actually infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic to check if `this` is zero instead of `z`, potentially allowing for cases where the operation would incorrectly return `Complex['INFINITY']` when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` only when `z` is not infinite, which is the opposite of the intended logic, potentially leading to incorrect results in calculations involving infinite values.

DONE.
