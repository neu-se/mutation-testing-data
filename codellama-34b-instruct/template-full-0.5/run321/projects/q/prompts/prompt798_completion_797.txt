  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return undefined instead of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null instead of a value.

DONE.
