  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event handler for the `close` event, and it would never be called, even if the `close` event is emitted.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would never be emitted in the original code, as the `zipArchive` is finalized without any errors.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
output.on('end', function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event would never be emitted in the original code, as the `zipArchive` is finalized without any errors.

DONE.
