  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called instead of the `resolve` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called with the `value` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the specified value instead of the default behavior of resolving with the `value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(value, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called with the `value` and `reason` arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the specified value and reason instead of the default behavior of resolving with the `value` argument.

DONE.
