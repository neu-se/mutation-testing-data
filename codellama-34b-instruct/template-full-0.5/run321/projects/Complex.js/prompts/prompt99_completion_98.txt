  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number, while `parseFloat(c)` would return a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.toFixed(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `toFixed` returns a string representation of the number with a specified number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.

DONE.
