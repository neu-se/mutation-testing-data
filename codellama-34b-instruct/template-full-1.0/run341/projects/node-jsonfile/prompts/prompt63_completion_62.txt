  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` would return a substring of the original content, whereas `toString` would return the entire content as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the content, whereas `toString` would return the content as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert all characters in the content to lowercase, whereas `toString` would return the content as is.

DONE.
