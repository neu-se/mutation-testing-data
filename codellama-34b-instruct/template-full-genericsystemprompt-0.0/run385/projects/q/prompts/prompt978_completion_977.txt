  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).npost(name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `npost` on the `Q` object instead of the `object` object, which would cause the method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `dispatch` on the `Q` object instead of the `object` object, which would cause the method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).ninvoke(name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `ninvoke` on the `Q` object instead of the `object` object, which would cause the method to be called on the wrong object.

DONE.
