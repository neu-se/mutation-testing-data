  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array element to be removed by 1, potentially removing the wrong element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array element to be removed by -1, potentially removing the wrong element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array element to be removed by 2, potentially removing the wrong element.

DONE.
