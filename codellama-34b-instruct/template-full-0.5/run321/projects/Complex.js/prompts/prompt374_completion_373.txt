  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is called with the wrong argument.

DONE.
