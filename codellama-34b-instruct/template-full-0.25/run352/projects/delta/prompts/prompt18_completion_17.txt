  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects being compared, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the two objects together, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the two objects, potentially leading to different results.

DONE.
