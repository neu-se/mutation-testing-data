  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(this, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a method that returns a promise that resolves with the value of `this` when the promise is fulfilled. In the original code, `Q` is used as a name, not as a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(this, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a method that returns a promise that resolves with the value of `this` after a delay of `x` milliseconds. In the original code, `Q` is used as a name, not as a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.timeout(this, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` is a method that returns a promise that resolves with the value of `this` after a delay of `x` milliseconds, but rejects if
