  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"push"
```
This would result in a different method being called on the object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pop"
```
This would result in a different method being called on the object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"shift"
```
This would result in a different method being called on the object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
