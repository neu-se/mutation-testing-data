  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the first two arguments, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the second and subsequent arguments, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the first and last arguments, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
