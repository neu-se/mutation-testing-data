  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function has a different execution context and arguments compared to the `setImmediate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestAnimationFrame` function has a different execution context and arguments compared to the `setImmediate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.resolve` function has a different execution context and arguments compared to the `setImmediate` function.

DONE.
