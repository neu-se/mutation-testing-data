  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, value)` passes a non-null value to the callback function, while the mutated code fragment `cb(null, null)` passes a null value. This change would cause the callback function to receive a different argument, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the code that uses the `once` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, value)` passes a null value as the first argument to the callback function, while the mutated code fragment `cb(true, value)` passes a non-null value as the first argument. This change would cause the callback function to receive different arguments, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the code that uses the `once` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value + 1)
