  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "null" instead of the expected type of the object, which could cause the `addRule` function to fail to add the rule to the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "undefined" instead of the expected type of the object, which could cause the `addRule` function to fail to add the rule to the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "Object" instead of the expected type of the object, which could cause the `addRule` function to fail to add the rule to the list.

DONE.
