  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.filter(function(source) { return source.type === 'buggy' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include sources with a type of 'buggy', whereas the original code fragment would include all sources.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.map(function(source) { return source.type })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of source types, whereas the original code fragment would return an array of sources.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.reduce(function(acc, source) { return acc + source.type }, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of all source types, whereas the original code fragment would return an array of sources.

DONE.
