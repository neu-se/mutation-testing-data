  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` creates a new array, unlike `arguments` which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(<PLACEHOLDER>, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `<PLACEHOLDER>` would need to be a valid object or array, while `arguments` is only a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(array_slice(arguments, 1), 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would create a new array, and then another `array_slice` would create a new slice of that array, unlike `arguments` which is only a single object.

DONE.
