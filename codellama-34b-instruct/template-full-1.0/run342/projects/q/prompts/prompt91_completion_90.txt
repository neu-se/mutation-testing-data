  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.slice` and `Array.prototype.slice` are different methods. The first one is used to slice an object and return a new object with a partial subset of properties, while the second one is used to slice an array and return a new array with a partial subset of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` returns a new array with a partial subset of elements, while `Array.prototype.join` returns a new string created by concatenating all the elements of an array, using a specified separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` and `Object.prototype.toString` are different methods. The first one is used to slice an array and return a new array with a partial subset of
