  Sure, here are three potential mutations of the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could result in a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the real part of the complex number multiplied by 2, which could result in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the real part of the complex number plus 1, which could result in a different result.

DONE.
