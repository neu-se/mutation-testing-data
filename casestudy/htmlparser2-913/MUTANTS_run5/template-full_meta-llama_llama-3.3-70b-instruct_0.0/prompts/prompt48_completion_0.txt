Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.updatePosition(3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the position offset is incremented by 3 instead of the original 0, potentially altering the end index and affecting the parsing of subsequent tokens.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.tokenizer.updatePosition(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updatePosition` method is called on the `tokenizer` object instead of the current object, potentially modifying the tokenizer's state instead of the parser's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.endIndex = this.tokenizer.getAbsoluteIndex() + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the end index is updated directly without calling the `updatePosition` method, which also updates the start index, potentially introducing inconsistencies in the parser's state.

DONE.
