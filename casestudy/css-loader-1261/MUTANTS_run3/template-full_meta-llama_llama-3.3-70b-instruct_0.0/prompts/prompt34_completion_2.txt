Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, which is the opposite of what `decodeURI` does, potentially leading to incorrect URL handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape
```
This would result in different behavior because, although `unescape` is already used in the `normalizeUrl` function, using it directly without the conditional check for native Win32 paths could lead to incorrect handling of certain URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(url) { return url; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement would simply return the original URL without any decoding, potentially leading to issues with URLs that contain special characters or escape sequences.

DONE.
