  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(input).toFixed(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest integer, which would cause the result to be incorrect for non-integer inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) - 0.000000001
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of a small number would cause the result to be slightly different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `Math.PI` would cause the result to be incorrect for non-angular measures.

DONE.
