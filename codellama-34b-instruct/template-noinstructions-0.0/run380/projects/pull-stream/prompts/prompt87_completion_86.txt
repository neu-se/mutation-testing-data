  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function, and `!cb` is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function, and `!test` is a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function, and `test()` is a function call that returns a value.

DONE.
