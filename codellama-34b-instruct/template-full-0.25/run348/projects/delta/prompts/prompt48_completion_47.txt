  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `embedType` is not equal to the first key in `b`, even if `b` has multiple keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || !Object.keys(b).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `embedType` is not defined or if `b` does not have a key that matches `embedType`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || !Object.keys(b).includes(embedType) || Object.keys(b).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `embedType` is not defined, if `b` does not have a key that matches `embedType`, or if `b` has more than one key.
