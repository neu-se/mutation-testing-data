Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `null` may lead to different handling of the callback in the consuming code, potentially causing unexpected results or errors if the consumer expects a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `null` would indicate a successful termination of the read process, which could mislead the consumer into thinking that the operation completed successfully when it may not have.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `data` instead of `null` would pass the actual data back to the callback, which could lead to incorrect processing or assumptions about the state of the read operation, especially if the consumer is not expecting any data at that point.

DONE.
