  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more ops to iterate, whereas the `hasNext` property is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method advances the iterator and returns the next op, whereas the `next` property is a reference to the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next op without advancing the iterator, whereas the `peek` property is a reference to the function itself.

DONE.
