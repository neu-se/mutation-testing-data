  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would cause the result to be negative, whereas the original code fragment would produce a positive result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places^2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be a different value, as the square of the imaginary part would be larger than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- Math.PI * this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign and PI multiplier would cause the result to be negative and have a different magnitude, whereas the original code fragment would produce a positive result.

DONE.
