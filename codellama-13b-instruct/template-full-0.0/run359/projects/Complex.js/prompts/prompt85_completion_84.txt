  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to treat the imaginary part of the complex number as a negative number, which would result in incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '1');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to treat the imaginary part of the complex number as a negative number, which would result in incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to treat the imaginary part of the complex number as a negative number, which would result in incorrect calculations.

DONE.
