  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove one element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array before the `atReport` index. This could cause the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays to fall out of sync.

This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove one element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array after the `atReport` index. This could cause the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays to fall out of sync.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove multiple elements from the `reportedUnhandled
