  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function creates a new deferred object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a new value instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.resolve()` function resolves the deferred object with a value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a new value instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.reject()` function rejects the deferred object, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of being resolved with a new value.

DONE.
