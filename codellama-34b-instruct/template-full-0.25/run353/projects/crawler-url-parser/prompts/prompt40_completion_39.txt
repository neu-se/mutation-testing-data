This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be used as the current URL even if `parsedUrl.host` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr == null

This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of the `||` operator, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be used as the current URL only if `parsedUrl.host` is null and `baseUrlStr` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of the `||` operator, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be used as the
