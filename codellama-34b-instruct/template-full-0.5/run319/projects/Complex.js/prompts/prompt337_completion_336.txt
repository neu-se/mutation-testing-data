  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan` function to return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the complex arcus tangent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `acot` function to return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the complex arcus cotangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `acsc` function to return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the complex arcus cosecans.

DONE.
