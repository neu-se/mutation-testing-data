  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|ind|code/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the word "ind" and "code" in addition to "appendix" and "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|[^aeiou]$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any word that ends in a consonant in addition to "appendix" and "index".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|[^aeiou]$|2$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any word that ends in a consonant or the number 2 in addition to "appendix" and "index".

DONE.
