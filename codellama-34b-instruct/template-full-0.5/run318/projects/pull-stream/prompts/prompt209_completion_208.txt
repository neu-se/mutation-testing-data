  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `aborted` variable to check if the operation was aborted, while the new code fragment uses the negation of `aborted` to check if the operation was not aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `aborted` is true, while the new code fragment checks if `aborted` is true and `err` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `aborted` is true, while the new code fragment checks if `aborted` is true or `err` is true.

DONE.
