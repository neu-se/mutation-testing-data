Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call the callback if it is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `false`), which means that if a valid callback function is provided, it will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it will call the callback with an error argument, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code that does not handle the error properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will schedule the callback to be called asynchronously, which may change the timing of when the callback is executed compared to the original synchronous call.

DONE.
