Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(currentPath, targetPath.replace('$', '$$$$'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `path.join` instead of `replace` on `file.name`, potentially changing the resulting path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath + '/' + path.basename(file.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the basename of `file.name` to `targetPath` instead of replacing `currentPath` with `targetPath` in `file.name`, potentially changing the resulting path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file.name.replace(currentPath, targetPath + '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a trailing slash to `targetPath` before replacing `currentPath` with `targetPath` in `file.name`, potentially changing the resulting path.

DONE.
