  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function if the test function returns a truthy value, while this code fragment calls the callback function regardless of the test function's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the data object as the second argument to the callback function, while this code fragment passes the data object as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes two arguments to the callback function, while this code fragment passes three arguments.

DONE.
