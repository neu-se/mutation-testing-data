  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid URL");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return `null` if the `baseUrlStr` is not a valid URL, while the modified code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "http://" + baseUrlStr;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the parsed URL object, while the modified code would return a string containing the protocol and the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, "http://");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the parsed URL object, while the modified code would return a string containing the protocol and the base URL, but with the "https" protocol replaced with "http".

DONE.
