  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method that returns an array of substrings, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a substring with a new substring, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that returns the index of the first match, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

DONE.
