  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the queue was empty or if the drain was waiting, while this new fragment is checking if the queue has items and if the drain is not waiting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the queue was not empty or if the drain was not waiting, while this new fragment is checking if the queue is empty and if the drain is waiting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the queue was empty or if the drain was waiting, while this new fragment is only checking if the drain is waiting.

DONE.
