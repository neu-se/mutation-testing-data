  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to `process.nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `flush` function to the `null` context, rather than passing it as a callback to `process.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { flush(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that calls `flush`, rather than passing the `flush` function as a callback to `process.nextTick`.

DONE.
