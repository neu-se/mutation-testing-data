  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array with the specified elements, whereas `pop` removes the last element and returns it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes the specified number of elements from the array, starting at the specified index, whereas `pop` removes the last element and returns it.

DONE.
