  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a function that logs an error message to the console, while `console.warn` is a function that logs a warning message to the console. If the `done` callback is not provided, the `console.error` function will be called, which will log an error message to the console, whereas the `console.warn` function will not be called, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, while `console.warn` is a function that logs a warning message to the console. If the `done` callback is not provided, the `console.log` function will be called, which will log a message to the console, whereas the `console.warn` function will not be called, resulting in different behavior.
