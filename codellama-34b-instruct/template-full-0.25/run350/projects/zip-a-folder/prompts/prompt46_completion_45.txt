  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `false`, which would cause the `directory` method to not include any files in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `false`, which would cause the `directory` method to not include any files in the archive. By replacing it with `!is
