  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of the `calculateDistance` function, which would cause the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of the `calculateDistance` function by 2, which would cause the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the result of the `calculateDistance` function, which would cause the function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
