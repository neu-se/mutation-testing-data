  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"filename": dest
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property would be set to the string "filename" instead of the value of the `dest` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"filename": "dest"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property would be set to the string "dest" instead of the value of the `dest` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"filename": null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property would be set to `null` instead of the value of the `dest` variable.

DONE.
