  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with `null` as the `this` context, instead of the expected `continuer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with `undefined` as the `this` context, instead of the expected `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(void 0, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with `void 0` (which is equivalent to `undefined`) as the `this` context, instead of the expected `continuer` function.

DONE.
