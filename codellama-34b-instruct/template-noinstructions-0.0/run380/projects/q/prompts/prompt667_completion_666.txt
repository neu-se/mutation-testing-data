  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the second argument instead of the first, which would cause the `name` argument to be omitted from the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the first argument instead of the second, which would cause the `name` argument to be included in the `args` array twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the last argument instead of the second, which would cause the `name` argument to be omitted from the `args` array.

DONE.
