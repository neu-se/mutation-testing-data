  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify.call` is a different method than `Q.denodeify.apply`, and it would not work as intended in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify.bind` is a different method than `Q.denodeify.apply`, and it would not work as intended in the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify.apply` is a different method than `Q.denodeify.apply`, and it would not work as intended in the context of the code.

DONE.
