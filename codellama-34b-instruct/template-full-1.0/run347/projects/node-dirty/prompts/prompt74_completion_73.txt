  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._emit` is not a function, so calling it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.bind()` returns a bound function, but doesn't call the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit.apply({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.apply({})` calls the function with an empty object as the context, which could potentially change the behavior of the `emit` method.

DONE.
