  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next op instead of the current op, which could cause the `peekLength()` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current index plus the offset, which could cause the `peekLength()` method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + this.offset]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the op at the current index plus the offset, which could cause the `peekLength()` method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
