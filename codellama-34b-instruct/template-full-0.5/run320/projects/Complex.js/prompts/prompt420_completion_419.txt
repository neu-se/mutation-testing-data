  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the opposite branch of the if statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is infinite, which is different from checking if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is not a number (NaN), which is different from checking if it is zero or infinite.

DONE.
