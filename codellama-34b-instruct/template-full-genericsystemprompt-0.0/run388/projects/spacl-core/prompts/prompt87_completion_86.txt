  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive a `null` argument instead of a valid `QueryContext` object, which could cause the method to throw an error or return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive an `undefined` argument instead of a valid `QueryContext` object, which could cause the method to throw an error or return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(new QueryContext())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive a new `QueryContext` object instead of the original one, which could cause the method to return a different result.

DONE.
