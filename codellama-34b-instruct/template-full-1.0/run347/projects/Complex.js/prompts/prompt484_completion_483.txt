  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== 'function' || !define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `define` function to be treated as not being an AMD loader, even if it is. This could cause problems if the module being defined is not compatible with the global loader.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `define` function to be treated as being an AMD loader if it is not. This could cause problems if the module being defined is not compatible with the AMD loader.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== 'function' || !define['amd'] || define['amd'] !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `define` function to be treated as not being an AMD loader, even if it is. This could cause problems if the module being defined is not compatible
