  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would convert the buffer to a UTF-16 string instead of a UTF-8 string, which could cause issues with the JSON parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would convert the buffer to an ASCII string instead of a UTF-8 string, which could cause issues with the JSON parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would convert the buffer to a base64 string instead of a UTF-8 string, which could cause issues with the JSON parsing.

DONE.
