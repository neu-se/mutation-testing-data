  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called instead of `resolve`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, "foo", args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called with a different value (`"foo"` instead of `op`) as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called with a different array of arguments (the original `args` array with the first element removed) as the second argument.

DONE.
