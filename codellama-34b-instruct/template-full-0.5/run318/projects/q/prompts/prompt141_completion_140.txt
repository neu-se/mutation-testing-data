  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the source of the source instead of the source itself, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the source of the source of the source instead of the source itself, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the source of the source of the source of the source instead of the source itself, leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
