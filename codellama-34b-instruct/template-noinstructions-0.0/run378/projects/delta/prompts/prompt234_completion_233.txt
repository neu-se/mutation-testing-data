  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and `insert` would insert the given operation at the current position in the delta, while `push` would append it to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` with a length of 0 would not have any effect on the delta, while `push` would append the given operation to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` with a length of 0 would not have any effect on the delta, while `push` would append the given operation to the end.

DONE.
