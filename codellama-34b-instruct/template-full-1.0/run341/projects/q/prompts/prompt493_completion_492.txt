  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a rejected promise instead of a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a fulfilled promise instead of a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.runAfter(process.nextTick(), function() {return reason;})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `process.nextTick()` to delay the execution of the callback function, which would affect the timing of the promise's resolution.

DONE.
