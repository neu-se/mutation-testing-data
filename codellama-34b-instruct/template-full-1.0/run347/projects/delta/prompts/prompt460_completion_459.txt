  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to consider the length of the `ops` array instead of the current index, which could return a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to consider the previous index instead of the current index, which could return a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length-this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to consider the length of the `ops` array minus the current index, which could return a different set of operations.

DONE.
