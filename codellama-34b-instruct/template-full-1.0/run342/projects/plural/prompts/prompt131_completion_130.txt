  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `type` is not being called, and the resulting expression would always be a boolean value, regardless of the type of the first element in the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) !== 'RegExp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `type` is not being called with the correct argument, and the resulting expression would always be a boolean value, regardless of the type of the first element in the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[0] !== 'regexp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `type` is not being called, and the resulting expression would always be a boolean value, regardless of the type of the first element in the `rules` array.

DONE.
