  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would be called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would be called with a string value instead of the actual value of the `value` variable, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would be called with `undefined` as the value, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
