  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number and `newOp.insert` is not null, but the replaced code checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number and `newOp.insert` is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number and `newOp.insert` is not null, but the replaced code checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number and `newOp.insert` is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp.
