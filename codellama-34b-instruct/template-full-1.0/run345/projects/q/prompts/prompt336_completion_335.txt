  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a resolved promise, even if the promise returned by `inspect()` was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise, even if the promise returned by `inspect()` was resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(Boolean(resolve));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise if `resolve` is truthy, and a rejected promise if `resolve` is falsy.

DONE.
