  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object === null` would only check if the `object` is null, whereas `!isObject(object)` checks if the `object` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.constructor !== Object` would check if the `object` is not an instance of the `Object` constructor, whereas `!isObject(object)` checks if the `object` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object !== 'object'` would check if the `object` is not an object, whereas `!isObject(object)` checks if the `object` is not an object.

DONE.
