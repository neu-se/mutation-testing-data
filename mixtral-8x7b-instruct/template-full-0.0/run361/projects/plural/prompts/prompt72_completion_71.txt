 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'cell' instead of 'cellos' when the input word is 'cello'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 'cell'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'cell' instead of 'cellos' when the input word is 'cello', regardless of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cellos' + word.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the first character of the input word to 'cellos', instead of replacing the last character with 's'.

DONE.
