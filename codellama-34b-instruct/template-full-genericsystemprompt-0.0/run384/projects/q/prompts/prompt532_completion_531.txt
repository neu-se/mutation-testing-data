  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value, whereas `spread` is a method that returns a promise for an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise for an array of values, whereas `spread` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a method that returns a promise for the first value that is resolved, whereas `spread` is a method that returns a promise for an array of values.

DONE.
