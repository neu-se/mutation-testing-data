 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 1 does not affect the value of the 'sinh' function's y-coordinate, whereas the original code fragment (b) considers the 'im' property of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it squares the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment (b) simply refers to the 'im' property of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a random value between 0 and 1, whereas the original code fragment (b) considers the 'im' property of the complex number.

DONE.
