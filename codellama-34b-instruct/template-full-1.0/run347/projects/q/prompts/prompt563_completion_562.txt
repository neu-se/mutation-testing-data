  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.value` returns the value of the exception, whereas `exception` would return the exception object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(exception)` would return a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, whereas `exception.value` would return the value of the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `value` property, whereas `exception` is an object that has a `value` property.

DONE.
