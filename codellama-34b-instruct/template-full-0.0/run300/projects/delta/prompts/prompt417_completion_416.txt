  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would advance the iterator to the next operation, whereas `thisIter.next` would only return the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` would return the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would advance the iterator to the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the next operation itself.

DONE.
