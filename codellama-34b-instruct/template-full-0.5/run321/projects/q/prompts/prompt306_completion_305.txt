  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop one iteration earlier than it should, potentially missing the last promise in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < answerPs.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop two iterations earlier than it should, potentially missing the last two promises in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < answerPs.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop three iterations earlier than it should, potentially missing the last three promises in the array.

DONE.
