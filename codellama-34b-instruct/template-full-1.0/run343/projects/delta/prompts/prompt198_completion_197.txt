  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the second-to-last element in the `ops` array instead of the last one, potentially causing the comparison to be made against a different operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `newOp` object instead of the `delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]` object, potentially causing the comparison to be made against a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1] === newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for object equality between the last operation and the `newOp` object, potentially causing the condition to evaluate to either true or false.

DONE.
