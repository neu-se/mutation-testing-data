  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to consider one more character than it should, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to consider one fewer character than it should, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to consider twice as many characters as it should, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
