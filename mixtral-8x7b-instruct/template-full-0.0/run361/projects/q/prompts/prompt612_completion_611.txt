 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method of the Promise prototype would receive `null` as the first argument instead of an object, causing a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method of the Promise prototype would receive an empty object as the first argument, which might not have the expected property, causing the promise to be rejected with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function() { /* empty function */ })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method of the Promise prototype would receive a function as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior. This would likely cause a `TypeError` when trying to access the property `key` on the function object.

DONE.
