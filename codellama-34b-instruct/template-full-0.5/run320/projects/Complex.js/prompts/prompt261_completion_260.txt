  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator changes the sign of the value, causing the `cos` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator changes the value of the expression, causing the `cos` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator changes the value of the expression, causing the `cos` function to return a different result.

DONE.
