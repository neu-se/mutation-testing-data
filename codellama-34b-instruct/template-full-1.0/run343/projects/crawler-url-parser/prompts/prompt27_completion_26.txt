  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is incorrect and would always match any string that starts with "http", regardless of the domain or subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match(/\blocalhost\b/i) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is incorrect and would match any string that does not contain the word "localhost", regardless of the domain or subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.match(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that is a substring of the base URL, regardless of the domain or subdomain.

DONE.
