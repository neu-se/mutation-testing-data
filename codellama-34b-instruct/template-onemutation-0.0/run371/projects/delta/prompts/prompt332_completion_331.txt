  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the baseOp, which is not what the original code intended to do. The original code intended to invert the attributes of the op, not the baseOp.
