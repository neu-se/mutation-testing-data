  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the arguments are not being used in the expected order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` argument has been moved to the end of the argument list, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the `onAbort` function is not being called in the expected order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument has been added to the end of the argument list, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the `onAbort` function is not being called with the expected number of arguments.

DONE.
