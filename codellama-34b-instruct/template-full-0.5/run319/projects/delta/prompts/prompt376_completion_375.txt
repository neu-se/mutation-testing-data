  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be considered an `insert` operation in the original code, leading to a different outcome in the `transform` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be considered an `insert` operation in the original code, leading to a different outcome in the `transform` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain' && thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be considered an `insert` operation in the original code, leading to a different outcome in the `transform` function, and the `delete` operation would be considered an `insert` operation in the original code, leading to a
