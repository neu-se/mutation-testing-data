  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more operations in the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext(1)` is a function call that returns the result of the function with the argument `1`, which is a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(otherIter.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext(otherIter.length)` is a function call that returns the result of the function with the argument `otherIter.length`, which is a boolean value.

DONE.
