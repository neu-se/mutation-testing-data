  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.shift()` would remove the first element of the `args` array, whereas `args.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.pop()` would remove the last element of the `args` array, whereas `args.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.push()` would add an element to the end of the `args` array, whereas `args.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
