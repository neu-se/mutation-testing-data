  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This could cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length or order of elements, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `Q.ninvoke` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging the `nodeArgs` array with another array, whereas `push` modifies the `nodeArgs` array by adding a new element to it. This could cause the `Q.ninvoke` method to receive a different set of arguments, which could in turn affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `
