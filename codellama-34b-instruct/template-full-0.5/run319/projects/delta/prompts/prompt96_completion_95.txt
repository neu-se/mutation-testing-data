  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the next index instead of the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the previous index instead of the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at twice the current index instead of the current index.

DONE.
