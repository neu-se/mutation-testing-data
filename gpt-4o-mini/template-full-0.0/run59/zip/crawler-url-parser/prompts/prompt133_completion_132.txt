Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path to a double slash, which could lead to incorrect URL resolution and potentially result in a malformed URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a specific file name to the path instead of just a slash, which could affect how the URL is interpreted and lead to incorrect routing or resource fetching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/default.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies a different default file name, which could change the expected resource that is being accessed, potentially leading to a 404 error if that file does not exist.

DONE.
