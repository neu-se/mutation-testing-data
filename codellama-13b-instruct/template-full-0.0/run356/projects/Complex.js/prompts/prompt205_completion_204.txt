  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the square root of the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the square root of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the square root of the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the real part.

DONE.
