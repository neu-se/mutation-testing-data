  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a property access expression that returns the `inspect` property of the `object` object, while `object.inspect()` is a function call expression that calls the `inspect` method of the `object` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.call()` is a call expression that calls the `call` method of the `inspect` property of the `object` object, while `object.inspect()` is a call expression that calls the `inspect` method of the `object` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect().call()` is a call expression that calls the `call` method of the return value of the `inspect` method
