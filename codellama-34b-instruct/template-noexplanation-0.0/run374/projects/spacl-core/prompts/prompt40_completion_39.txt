  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to split the `spec` string on forward slashes, rather than on the default separator. This will result in a different set of `parts` being generated, which may cause the `Matcher` class to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//, 2)
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to split the `spec` string on forward slashes, but only up to two times. This will result in a different set of `parts` being generated, which may cause the `Matcher` class to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//, -1)
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to split the `spec` string on forward slashes, but only up to the last occurrence. This will result in a different set of `parts` being generated, which may
