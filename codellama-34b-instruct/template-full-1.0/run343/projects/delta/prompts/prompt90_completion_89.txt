  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain === 0 && lastOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain === 0` would return true even if the value of `newOp.retain` is not 0, but an object with a `0` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain != lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain != lastOp.retain` would return true even if the values of `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` are the same, but with different types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain !== lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain !== lastOp.retain` would return true even if the values of `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` are
