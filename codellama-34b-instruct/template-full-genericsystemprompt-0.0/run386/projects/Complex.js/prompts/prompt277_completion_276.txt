  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, which is different from the cosine function `Math.cosh` used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the cosine function, which is different from the hyperbolic sine function `Math.sinh` used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which is different from the cosine function `Math.cosh` used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
