 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty string to the `parts` array, which would then be included in the final regex pattern. This could lead to unexpected matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a number to the `parts` array, which would then be included in the final regex pattern. Since the other elements in the `parts` array are strings, this would lead to unexpected results and possibly runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push(props)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `props` array to the `parts` array, which would then be included in the final regex pattern. Since the other elements in the `parts` array are strings, this would lead to unexpected results and possibly runtime errors.

DONE.
