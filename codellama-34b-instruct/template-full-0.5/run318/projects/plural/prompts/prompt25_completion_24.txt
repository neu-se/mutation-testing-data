  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` returns a substring of the original string, while `w.substring` returns a substring starting from the specified index until the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` returns a substring of the original string, while `w.substr(1)` returns a substring starting from the second character of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` returns a substring of the original string, while `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` returns a substring starting from the first character of the original string and ending at the second-to-last character.

DONE.
