Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return the value of a promise that is still pending, rather than one that has been fulfilled, potentially leading to incorrect handling of promise values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is defined instead of checking the state of the promise, which could lead to returning a value even if the promise is rejected or still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of a promise that has been rejected, which is not the intended behavior of returning the fulfilled value, thus leading to incorrect promise resolution handling.

DONE.
