  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(r > 1 ? 1 : r) * 6371392.896;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.acos` to calculate the arccosine of `r`, but this code fragment uses `Math.acos` to calculate the arccosine of `r > 1 ? 1 : r`, which would result in a different value for the distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(r > 1 ? 1 : r) * 6371392.896;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.asin` to calculate the arcsine of `r`, but this code fragment uses `Math.asin` to calculate the arcsine of `r > 1 ? 1 : r`, which would result in a different value for the distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACE
