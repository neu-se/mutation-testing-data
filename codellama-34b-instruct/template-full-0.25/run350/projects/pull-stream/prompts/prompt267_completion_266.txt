  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `nextStream` function to be called, even if the stream has not ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end + 1` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `nextStream` function to be called, even if the stream has ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - 1` expression would always evaluate to a falsy value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `nextStream` function to never be called, even if the stream has ended.

DONE.
