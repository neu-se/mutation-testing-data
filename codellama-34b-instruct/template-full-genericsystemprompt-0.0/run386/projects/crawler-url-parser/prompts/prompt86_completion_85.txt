  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the href attribute of the current element, which may not be the same as the text content of the element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the HTML content of the current element, which may not be the same as the text content of the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).val()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the current element, which may not be the same as the text content of the element.

DONE.
