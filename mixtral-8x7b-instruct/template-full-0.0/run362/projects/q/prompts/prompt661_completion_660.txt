 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `Promise.prototype.invoke` method would fail, causing the method to not execute as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `dispatch` method with an empty function, causing all calls to `this.dispatch` to do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"promiseDispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly call the `promiseDispatch` method instead of passing it as a parameter to be called in the next tick. This could cause issues if the method relies on the `this` context or if it is not meant to be called directly.

DONE.
