  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.unshift(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the element to the beginning of the array, while `push` adds it to the end. If the `countries` array is non-empty, this would cause the first element in the `countries` array to be pushed to the end of the `result[country].all` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all[0] = id;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the 0th index of the `result[country].all` array to `id`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
