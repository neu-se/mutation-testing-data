  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'gi')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag has been added to the regular expression, which makes the match case-insensitive. This would cause the regular expression to match words that are not in the original list, such as "goggles" and "scissors".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')es\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `es` suffix has been added to the regular expression. This would cause the regular expression to match words that are not in the original list, such as "goggles" and "scissors".
