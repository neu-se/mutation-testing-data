  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function stored in the `descriptor` object with the `promise` and `args` arguments, rather than applying the function to the `promise` and `args` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function stored in the `descriptor` object with the `promise` object as the context, rather than the `descriptor` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function stored in the `descriptor` object with the `promise` object as the context and the `args` array as the arguments, rather than the `descriptor` object and the `args` array.

DONE
