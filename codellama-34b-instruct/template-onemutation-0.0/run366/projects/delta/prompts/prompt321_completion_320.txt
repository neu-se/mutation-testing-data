  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `op.retain` is a non-empty object, regardless of whether `op.delete` is `true` or not. In the original code, `op.retain` is only considered if `op.delete` is not `true`.
