  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it checks if the path specification contains a colon, a slash, or a dollar sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original code fragment, and it checks if the path specification does not contain a colon, a slash, or a dollar sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This code fragment checks if the path specification contains a colon, a slash, or a dollar sign, and if it also contains a colon, a slash, or a dollar sign. This code fragment is redundant and will always evaluate to true.

DONE.
