  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test(data)` function is only called once per data item, and the `+ 1` operation would increase the number of times the function is called, potentially resulting in a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test(data)` function is only called once per data item, and the `* 2` operation would double the number of times the function is called, potentially resulting in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test(data)` function is only called once per data item, and the `- 1` operation would decrease the number of times the function is called, potentially resulting in a different result.

DONE.
