 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `sin(point2Rad)` calculation with the number 1, which would affect the distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude, which would affect the distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness into the calculation, which would make the distance calculation unpredictable and inconsistent.

DONE.
