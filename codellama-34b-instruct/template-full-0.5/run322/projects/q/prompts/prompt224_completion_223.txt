  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and it does not have the same properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Promise.prototype` is an object that defines the properties and methods of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods, whereas `Promise.prototype` is an object that defines the properties and methods of a promise.

DONE.
