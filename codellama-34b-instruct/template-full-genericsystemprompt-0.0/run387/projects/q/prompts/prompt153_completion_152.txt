  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, while `join` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` modifies the original array, while `concat` returns a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` modifies the original array, while `concat` returns a new array.

DONE.
