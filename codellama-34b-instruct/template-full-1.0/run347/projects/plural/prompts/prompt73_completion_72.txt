  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'crackers'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural "s" to the word, but this new code fragment adds "crackers."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'criminies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural "s" to the word, but this new code fragment adds "criminies."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural "s" to the word, but this new code fragment keeps the original word without adding the plural "s."

DONE.
