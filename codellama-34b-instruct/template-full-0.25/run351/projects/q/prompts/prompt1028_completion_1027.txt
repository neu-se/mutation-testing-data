  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the error to the nodeback, while this code passes both the error and the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the error as the first argument to the nodeback, while this code passes it as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the value as the second argument to the nodeback, while this code passes it as the first argument.

DONE.
