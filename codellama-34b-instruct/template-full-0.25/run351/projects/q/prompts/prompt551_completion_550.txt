  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `value` property of the `result` object, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `value` property of the `result` object plus one, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `value` property of the `result` object multiplied by two, which may not be the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
