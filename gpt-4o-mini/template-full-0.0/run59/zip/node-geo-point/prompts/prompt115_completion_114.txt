Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of the latitude instead of converting the latitude from degrees to radians, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude instead of the latitude for the conversion to radians, which would affect the calculations that depend on the latitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the latitude by 360 instead of 180, effectively halving the conversion factor and leading to incorrect results in the calculations that rely on the latitude in radians.

DONE.
