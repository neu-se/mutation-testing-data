  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop over the `verbs` object instead of the `verbs` array, potentially changing the order of the loop and the values that are accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop over the `verbs` array instead of the `verbs` object, potentially changing the order of the loop and the values that are accessed.

DONE.
