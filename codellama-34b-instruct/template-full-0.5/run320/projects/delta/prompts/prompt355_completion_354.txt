  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arg` parameter is a number, but this replacement would check if it is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arg` parameter is a number, but this replacement would check if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arg` parameter is a number, but this replacement would check if it is undefined.

DONE.
