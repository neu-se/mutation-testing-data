  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first op in the slice, potentially changing the result of the `rest()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.offset, this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the offset in the slice, potentially changing the result of the `rest()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include both the index and offset in the slice, potentially changing the result of the `rest()` method.

DONE.
