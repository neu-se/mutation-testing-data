  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 || places
```
This would result in different behavior because `0 || places` will always evaluate to `0`, even if `places` has a value other than `0`. In contrast, `places || 0` will evaluate to `places` if it is not `0`, or `0` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `places || 1` will always evaluate to `places` if it is not `0`, or `1` otherwise. In contrast, `places || 0` will evaluate to `places` if it is not `0`, or `0` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(places)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(places)` will always evaluate to the absolute value of `places`, whereas `places || 0` will evaluate to `
