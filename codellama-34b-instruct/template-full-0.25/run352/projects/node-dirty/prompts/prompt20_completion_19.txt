  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the flush to happen immediately, regardless of the current state of the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the flush from happening immediately, even if the queue is full.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.size > 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only flush the queue if it contains more than 100 items, which could cause the queue to grow indefinitely if the flush is not happening frequently enough.

DONE.
