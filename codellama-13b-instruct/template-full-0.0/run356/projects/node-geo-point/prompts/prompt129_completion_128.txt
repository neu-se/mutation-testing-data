  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a static method call, while the new code fragment is an instance method call. This could potentially cause different behavior if the `toTile` method has different implementations for static and instance calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `zoom` parameter as-is, while the new code fragment increments the `zoom` parameter by 1. This could potentially cause different behavior if the `toTile` method has different implementations for different zoom levels.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `zoom` parameter as-is, while the new code fragment decre
