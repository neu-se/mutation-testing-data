  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because `policies.map` would return a new array with the same elements as `policies`, whereas `policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy])` would return a new array with elements that are arrays containing the policy name and the policy object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name === 'default').map(policy => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because `policies.filter` would return a new array with only the policies that have the name 'default', whereas `policies.map` would return a new array with all the policies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => [...acc, [policy.name, policy]], [])
```
This would result
