  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `nextOp.retain` is a number, regardless of whether it is `null` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `nextOp.retain` is not `null`, regardless of whether it is a number or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `nextOp.retain` is an object that is not `null`, regardless of whether it is a number or not.

DONE.
