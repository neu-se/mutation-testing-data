  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different mathematical properties, leading to different results in the calculations performed by the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` and `Math.cos` have different mathematical properties, leading to different results in the calculations performed by the `toTile` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.abs(1 - Math.sqrt(Math.abs(coordinate.longitude)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a more complex mathematical expression than the original code fragment, and it introduces additional mathematical operations and functions, which could potentially alter the behavior of the `toTile` method.

DONE.
