 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the `name` argument in the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause unexpected behavior in the called method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype` instead of `[].slice`, which could cause issues if the `Array.prototype.slice` method has been modified or replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause unexpected behavior if the original `nodeArgs` array is modified after this line of code.

DONE.
