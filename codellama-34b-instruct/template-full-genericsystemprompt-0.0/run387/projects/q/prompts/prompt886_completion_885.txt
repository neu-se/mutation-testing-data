  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, while the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, while the `sort` method sorts the elements of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, while the `splice` method removes and replaces elements in the array.

DONE.
