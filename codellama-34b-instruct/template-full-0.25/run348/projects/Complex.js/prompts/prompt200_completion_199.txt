  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `b`, which refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a` refers to the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `b`, which refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `c` refers to the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `b`, which refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `d` refers to the real part.

DONE.
