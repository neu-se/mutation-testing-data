  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `value` parameter in the `fulfill` method, and would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `value` parameter in the `fulfill` method, and would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a valid value for the `value` parameter in the `fulfill` method, and would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `"hello"`.

DONE.
