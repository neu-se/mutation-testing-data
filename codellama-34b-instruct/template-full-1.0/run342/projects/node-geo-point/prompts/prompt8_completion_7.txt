  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && point.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the point object has both 'latitude' and 'longitude' properties, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || point.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the point object has either 'latitude' or 'longitude' property, which would allow for invalid points to be created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !point.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the point object does not have either 'latitude' or 'longitude' properties, which would allow for invalid points to be created.
