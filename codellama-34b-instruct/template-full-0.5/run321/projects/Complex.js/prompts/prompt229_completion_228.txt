  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the expression is flipped, which would cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `b` is added to the expression, which would cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the variables `a` and `b` are added to the expression, which would cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect values.

DONE.
