  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not equal to `null`, and would therefore cause the `nodeback` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string value that is not equal to `null`, and would therefore cause the `nodeback` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, and would therefore cause the `nodeback` function to be called with an error object rather than a null value.

DONE.
