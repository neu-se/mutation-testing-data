  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, whereas the original code uses the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array with only the elements that match the provided predicate, whereas the original code uses the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array with the results of calling the provided function on each element, whereas the original code uses the original array.

DONE.
