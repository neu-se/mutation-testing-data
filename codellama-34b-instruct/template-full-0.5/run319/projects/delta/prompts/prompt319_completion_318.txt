Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(op))` would retain the entire line, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the first character of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op), { color: 'red' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(op), { color: 'red' })` would retain the entire line and apply a red color attribute to it, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the first character of
