  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "allResolved" at the end would cause the function to be called twice, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "allSettled" at the end would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
