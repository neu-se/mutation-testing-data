Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `otherIter` to skip the next element by advancing it by 2 instead of 1, potentially missing an important operation in the transformation process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation would be processed multiple times instead of moving forward in the sequence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing to advance the iterator, leading to an infinite loop if the condition to exit the loop is not met, as it would keep processing the same operation repeatedly.

DONE.
