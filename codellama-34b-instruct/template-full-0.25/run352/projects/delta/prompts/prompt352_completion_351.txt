  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to an incorrect inversion of the attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to be called with the same arguments, leading to an incorrect inversion of the attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes, op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to be called with the correct arguments, leading to a correct inversion of the attributes.

DONE.
