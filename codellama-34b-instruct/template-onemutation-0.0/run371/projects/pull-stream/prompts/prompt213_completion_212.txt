  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object if an error occurs during the mapping process. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to behave as if no error occurred, even if one did.

DONE.
