  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.href` is a different property than `url` and could potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.protocol` is a different property than `url` and could potentially return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.host` is a different property than `url` and could potentially return a different value.

DONE.
