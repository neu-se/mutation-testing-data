  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands has been reversed. The original code was using `-` operator which means subtraction of `offset` from `index`, but in this modified code we are subtracting `index` from `offset` which will result in a completely different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has been replaced with `*`. This will result in a different result because multiplication has higher precedence than addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `1` has been added to the subtraction. This will result in a different result because it is no longer subtraction, it is subtraction and addition.

DONE.
