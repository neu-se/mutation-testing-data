  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `bound` is a function that takes arguments, and `undefined` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `bound` is a function that takes arguments, and `null` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `bound` is a function that takes arguments, and `true` is not a function.

DONE.
