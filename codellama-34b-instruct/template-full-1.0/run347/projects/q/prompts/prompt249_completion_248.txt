  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is not a function and would throw an error when invoked. The code would not work as intended and the mutation would introduce a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a function that returns a section of the string, whereas `indexOf` returns the first index where the search string appears. The code would not work as intended and the mutation would introduce a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the last index where the search string appears, whereas `indexOf` returns the first index. The code would not work as intended and the mutation would introduce a bug.

DONE.
