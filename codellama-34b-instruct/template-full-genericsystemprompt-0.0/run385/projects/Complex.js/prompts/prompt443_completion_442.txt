  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a non-zero base value, and `0` is not a valid base value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a positive base value, and `-1` is not a valid base value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a finite base value, and `Infinity` is not a valid base value.

DONE.
