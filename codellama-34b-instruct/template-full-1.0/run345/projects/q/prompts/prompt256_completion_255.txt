  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise, regardless of whether it has already been resolved or not, and would fail to reject the promise even if it has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the double value of the resolved value, regardless of whether it has already been resolved or not, and would fail to reject the promise even if it has already been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with a promise, regardless of whether it has already been resolved or not, and would fail to reject the promise even if it has already been resolved.

DONE.
