  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `exception` is an object that represents the exception that was caught. Using `reject(exception)` instead of `exception` would cause the promise to be rejected with the `exception` object as the reason, rather than fulfilled with the `exception` object as the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `exception` is an object that represents the exception that was caught. Using `throw exception` instead of `exception` would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to throw the `exception` object, rather than returning it as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error(exception)` creates a new error object with the `exception` object
