  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the next element in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the current element in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the current element in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the next element, and it would also cause the loop to iterate over the length of the current element, rather than the element itself.

DONE.
