  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the current domain to exit, potentially affecting the execution of subsequent code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the current domain to enter, potentially affecting the execution of subsequent code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the current domain to be destroyed, potentially affecting the execution of subsequent code.

DONE.
