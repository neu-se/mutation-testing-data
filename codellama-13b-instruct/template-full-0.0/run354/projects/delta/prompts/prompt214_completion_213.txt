  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the first operation in `other.ops` is being accessed instead of the entire operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the first operation in `other.ops` is being accessed instead of the entire operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the first operation in `other.ops` is being accessed instead of the entire operation.

DONE.
