  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y, x
```
This would result in different behavior because the atan2 function requires the y-coordinate to be passed as the first argument, not the negation of the y-coordinate. This would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the atan2 function requires the y-coordinate to be passed as the first argument, not the x-coordinate. This would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, -x
```
This would result in different behavior because the atan2 function requires the y-coordinate to be passed as the first argument, not the negation of the x-coordinate. This would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly for some inputs.

DONE.
