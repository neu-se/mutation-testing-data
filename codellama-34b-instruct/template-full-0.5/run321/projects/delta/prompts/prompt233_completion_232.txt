  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.hasNext()` would check if there are any more operations in the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext()` would check if there are any more operations in the other iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the other iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` would return the next operation in the current iterator, while `otherIter.peek()` would return the next operation in the other iterator.

DONE.
