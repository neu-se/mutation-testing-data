  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the callbacks to be called in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, which would cause the callbacks to be called with a different set of arguments than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the callbacks to be called with a different set of arguments than expected.

DONE.
