  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCity
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCity` is a different function than `buildCountry`, and it may return a different result for the given input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `buildCountry` with a different ID, which may return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `buildCountry` with a different set of arguments, which may return a different result.

DONE.
