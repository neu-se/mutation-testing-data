  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator to the next element, whereas `otherIter.peek()` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.previous()` moves the iterator back to the previous element, whereas `otherIter.peek()` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek(2)` returns the second element in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.peek()` returns the first element.

DONE.
