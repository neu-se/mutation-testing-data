  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the transformPosition function to behave differently when an insert operation is encountered in the other iter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the transformPosition function to behave differently when a retain operation is encountered in the this iter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the transformPosition function to behave differently when the length of the operation in the other iter is zero or negative.

DONE.
