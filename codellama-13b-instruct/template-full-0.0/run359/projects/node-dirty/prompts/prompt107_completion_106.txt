  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid key-value pair, while the buggy code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key-value pair to the value stored in the `row.val` property, while the buggy code fragment sets the value to the result of adding 1 to the value stored in the `row.val` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key-value pair to the value stored in the `row.val` property, while the buggy code fragment sets the value to the result of multiplying the value stored in the `row.val` property by 2.
