  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, while `search` returns the index of the first match, which could lead to different logic errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks for a match anywhere in the string, while `includes` checks for a substring, which could lead to different logic errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks for a match at the beginning of the string, while `startsWith` checks for a substring at the beginning of the string, which could lead to different logic errors in the code.

DONE.
