  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected one, which would cause it to return a promise for the return value of the `fulfilled` callback instead of a promise for the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive an undefined value instead of a rejected promise, which would cause it to return a promise for the return value of the `fulfilled` callback instead of a promise for the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a null value instead of a rejected promise, which would cause it to return a promise for the return value of the `fulfilled` callback instead of a promise for the rejection reason.

DONE.
