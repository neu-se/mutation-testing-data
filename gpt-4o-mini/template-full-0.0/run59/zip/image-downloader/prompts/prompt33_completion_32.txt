Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy()` immediately terminates the response stream, which may lead to unprocessed data being lost, whereas `res.resume()` consumes the data to free up memory without losing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pause()` stops the flow of data from the response stream, preventing any data from being consumed, while `res.resume()` allows the data to be consumed and processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.setEncoding('utf8');
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.setEncoding('utf8')` changes the encoding of the response data to UTF-8, which may alter how the data is processed or interpreted, whereas `res.resume()` simply consumes the data without changing its encoding.

DONE.
