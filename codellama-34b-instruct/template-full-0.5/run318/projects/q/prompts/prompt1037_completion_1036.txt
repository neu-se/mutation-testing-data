  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(ends.promise.get("tail"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object for the `next` variable, which would not be linked to the original promise chain. As a result, the `put` method would not be able to resolve the promise chain correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(ends.promise.get("tail").fail(function (error) {
    closed.resolve(error);
    throw error;
}));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional error handler to the `get` method, which would catch any errors that occur during the promise chain resolution. This would change the behavior of the `put` method, as it would no longer be able to resolve the promise chain correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(ends.
