Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key = 'nonExistentKey';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to always skip the assignment to `attributes`, as `a[key]` would always be `undefined`, leading to potentially missing attributes from `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, which means that the logic intended to add attributes from `a` to `attributes` would not execute correctly, potentially resulting in incorrect or missing attributes in the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of Object.keys(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the iteration method from a `for...in` loop (which iterates over all enumerable properties) to a `for...of` loop that only iterates over the keys of `a`, which could lead to skipping over inherited properties or non-enumerable properties that might be relevant.

DONE.
