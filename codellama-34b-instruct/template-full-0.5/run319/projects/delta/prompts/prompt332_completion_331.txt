  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is called with the wrong arguments, which would cause the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is called with the wrong arguments, which would cause the `transform` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method is called with the wrong arguments, which would cause the `compose` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
