  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the value of Euler's number `e` raised to the power of the argument, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` returns the arctangent of the argument, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the argument.

DONE.
