  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `object` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `object` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a call to the `slice` method on the `arguments` object, whereas `object` is a primitive value. DONE.
