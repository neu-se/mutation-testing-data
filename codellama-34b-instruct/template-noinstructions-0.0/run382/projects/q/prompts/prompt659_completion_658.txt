  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the second argument instead of the first, which would cause the `name` argument to be omitted from the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the third argument instead of the first, which would cause the `object` and `name` arguments to be omitted from the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the first argument instead of the second, which would cause the `object` argument to be included in the `args` array.

DONE.
