  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is an object with a `message` property.

DONE.
