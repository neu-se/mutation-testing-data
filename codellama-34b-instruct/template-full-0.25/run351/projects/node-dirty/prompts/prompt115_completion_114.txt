  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of an array, not an object, and would return the number of elements in the array, not the size of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size()` is a method of an object, not a property, and would return the size of the object, not the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of an array, not an object, and would return the number of elements in the array, not the size of the object.

DONE.
