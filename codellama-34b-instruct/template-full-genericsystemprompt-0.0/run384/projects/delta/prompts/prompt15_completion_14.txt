  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` would also match `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` would only match `null`, and not `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && a !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== null && a !== undefined` would match any value that is not `null` or `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
