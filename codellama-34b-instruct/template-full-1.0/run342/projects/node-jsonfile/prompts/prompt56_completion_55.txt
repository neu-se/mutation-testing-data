  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `replaceAll()` would replace all instances of the specified substring within the string, rather than just the first one found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.search()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `search()` would return the index of the first occurrence of the substring within the string, rather than replacing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `split()` would split the string at each occurrence of the specified substring, rather than replacing it.

DONE.
