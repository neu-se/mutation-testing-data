 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of cloning the `newOp`. This could lead to unexpected results in the `push` method, as it might modify the original `newOp` instead of a cloned copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the new operation to `null` instead of cloning the `newOp`. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the `push` method, as it might try to access properties of a `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it reuses the last operation instead of creating a new one. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the `push` method, as it might modify the last operation instead of inserting a new one.

DONE.
