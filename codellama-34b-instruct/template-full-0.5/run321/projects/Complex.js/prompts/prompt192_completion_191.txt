  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real component of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the imaginary component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return half the imaginary component of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the imaginary component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of the imaginary component of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the imaginary component.

DONE.
