  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that removes and replaces elements in an array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes and returns the last element of an array, whereas `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a method that removes and returns the first element of an array, whereas `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
