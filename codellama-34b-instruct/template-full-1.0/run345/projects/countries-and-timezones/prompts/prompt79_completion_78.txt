  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null string as an argument, but this code would pass `null`, causing the function to return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone().name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string as an argument, but this code would pass `undefined`, causing the function to return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone('Invalid timezone name')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a valid timezone name as an argument, but this code would pass an invalid name, causing the function to return `null`.

Done.
