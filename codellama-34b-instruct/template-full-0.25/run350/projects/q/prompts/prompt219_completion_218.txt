  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would return `null` instead of a promise, which would cause any code that relies on the returned promise to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would return `undefined` instead of a promise, which would cause any code that relies on the returned promise to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would throw an error instead of returning a promise, which would cause any code that relies on the returned promise to fail.

DONE.
