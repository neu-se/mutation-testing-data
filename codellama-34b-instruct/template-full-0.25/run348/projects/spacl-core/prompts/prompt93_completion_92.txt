  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to `policy`, instead of adding a new entry to the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to `policy.name`, instead of adding a new entry to the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy.name + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to `policy.name + '1'`, instead of adding a new entry to the map.

DONE.
