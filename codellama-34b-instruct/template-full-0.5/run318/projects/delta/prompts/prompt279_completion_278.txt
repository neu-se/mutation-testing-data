  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` function would return the length of a string, whereas `1` would be a constant value of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` function would return the length of a string, whereas `null` would be a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` function would return the length of a string, whereas `undefined` would be an undefined value.

DONE.
