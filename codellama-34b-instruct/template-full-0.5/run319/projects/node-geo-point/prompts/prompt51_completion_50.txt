  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the difference between the two longitudes, while this code calculates the sum of the two longitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the difference between the two longitudes, while this code calculates the product of the two longitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude / point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the difference between the two longitudes, while this code calculates the quotient of the two longitudes.

DONE.
