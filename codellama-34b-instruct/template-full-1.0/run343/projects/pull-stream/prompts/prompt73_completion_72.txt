  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` would no longer be the same value as the original code, making the conditional expression result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` would always be truthy, regardless of its original value, making the conditional expression result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read ? {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the truthiness of `read` would be negated, making the conditional expression result in a different value.

DONE.
