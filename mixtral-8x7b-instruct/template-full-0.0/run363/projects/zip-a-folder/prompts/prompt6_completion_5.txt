 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the targetBasePath to the current working directory, instead of calculating the directory name of the targetFilePath.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the base name of the targetFilePath instead of its directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(targetFilePath) => path.dirname(targetFilePath).split(path.sep).slice(0, -1).join(path.sep)
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the directory name into an array, removes the last element (representing the base name), and then rejoins the array into a string. This could lead to different behavior if the targetFilePath contains symbolic links or uses a different path separator.

DONE.
