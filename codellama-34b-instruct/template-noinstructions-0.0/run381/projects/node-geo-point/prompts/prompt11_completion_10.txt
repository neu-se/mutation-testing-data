  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of the 'coordinates' property in the 'point' object, while the new code fragment is checking for the presence of the 'coordinates' property in the 'point' object's 'type' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of the 'type' property in the 'point' object, while the new code fragment is checking for the presence of the 'type' property in the 'point' object's 'coordinates' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of the 'latitude' property in the 'point' object, while the new code fragment is checking for the presence of the 'latitude' property in the 'point'
