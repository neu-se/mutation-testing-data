  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to `φ2`, which is the result of the previous calculation, rather than `φ1`, which is the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being applied to `φ2`, which is the result of the previous calculation, rather than `φ1`, which is the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
