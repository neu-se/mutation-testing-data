  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" &&
            typeof console.warn === "function" &&
            typeof console.warn.call === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `console.warn` is a function, but does not check if it is callable. The modified code fragment also checks if `console.warn.call` is a function, which is a necessary condition for `console.warn` to be callable.
