  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the attribute in the `a` object instead of the `b` object, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the attribute in the `b` object, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of the attribute in the `b` object by 2, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

DONE.
