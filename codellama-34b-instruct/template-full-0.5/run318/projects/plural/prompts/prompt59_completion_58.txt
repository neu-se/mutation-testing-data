  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a string literal, while this replacement is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a string literal, while this replacement is a concatenation of two string literals.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural('criterion')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a string literal, while this replacement is a function call that returns a pluralized version of the string.

DONE.
