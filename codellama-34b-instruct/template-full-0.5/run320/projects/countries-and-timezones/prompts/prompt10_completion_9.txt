  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the `result` object does not have a property with the name of the `country`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `result` object has a property with the name of the `country` and if its value is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `result` object has a property with the name of the `country` and if its value is not `undefined`.

DONE.
