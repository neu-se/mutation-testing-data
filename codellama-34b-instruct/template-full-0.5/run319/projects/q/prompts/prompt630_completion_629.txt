  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed with an additional argument `value`, which would cause the operation to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` operation would be performed with an additional argument `value`, which would cause the operation to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` operation would be performed with an additional argument `value`, which would cause the operation to fail.

DONE.
