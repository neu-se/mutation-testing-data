  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the comparison, causing the `retain` block to be executed even if the `insert` values are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality, which would cause the `retain` block to be executed only if the `insert` values are strictly equal, rather than just equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert != otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality, which would cause the `retain` block to be executed if the `insert` values are not equal, rather than just equal.

DONE.
