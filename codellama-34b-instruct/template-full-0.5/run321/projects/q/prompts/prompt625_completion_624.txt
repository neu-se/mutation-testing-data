  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `object` is a reference to the object being used, whereas `null` would indicate that the object is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `object` is a reference to the object being used, whereas `undefined` would indicate that the object is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `object` is a reference to the object being used, whereas `{}` would create a new empty object.

DONE.
