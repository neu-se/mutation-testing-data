  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect or incomplete result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect or incomplete result.

DONE.
