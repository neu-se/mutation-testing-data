 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality, including the type of the variables, instead of just checking if the paths are equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.length === pageurl_path.length
