  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is negated, causing the code to enter the `return 'NaN';` block even when the input is a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks for both positive and negative infinity, whereas the original code only checks for positive infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method is negated, causing the code to enter the `return 'Infinity';` block even when the input is a finite number.

DONE.
