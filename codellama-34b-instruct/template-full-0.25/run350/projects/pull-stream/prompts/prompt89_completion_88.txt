  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `test` function would be called with `false` as an argument, which would likely cause it to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the `test` function would be called with `true` as an argument, which would likely cause it to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the `test` function would be called with the negation of its original argument, which would likely cause it to return a different value than it
