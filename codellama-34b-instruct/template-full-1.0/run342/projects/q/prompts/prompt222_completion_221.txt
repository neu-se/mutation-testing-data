  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `promiseDispatch` to be called on `null` instead of `Promise.prototype`, which would throw a `TypeError` and prevent the promise from being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
document
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `promiseDispatch` to be called on the `document` object instead of `Promise.prototype`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `document` object instead of the desired value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `promiseDispatch` to be called on `object_create(Promise.prototype)`, which is not a valid promise and would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
