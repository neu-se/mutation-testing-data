  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression in JavaScript, but `null` is not. The `then` method of the promise would not be called with `null` as the argument, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression in JavaScript, but `undefined` is not. The `then` method of the promise would not be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression in JavaScript, but `NaN` is not. The `then` method of the promise would not be called with `NaN` as the argument, which would result in a different outcome.

DONE.
