  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the request would be made over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the request would be made to a different domain than the one specified in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://example.com/path/to/resource'
```
This would result in different behavior because the request would be made to a different resource than the one specified in the original code.

DONE.
