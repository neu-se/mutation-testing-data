  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` operator would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `end`. In the original code, the `end` variable is used to determine whether the `mapper` function should be called or not. If `end` is `true`, the `mapper` function is not called and `null` is returned. By replacing `end` with `!end`, the `mapper` function would always be called, which could result in unexpected behavior if the function is not designed to handle all possible inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate the second operand (`mapper(data)`) if the first operand (`end`) is `true`. In the original code, the `mapper` function is called regardless of the value of `end`. By replacing `end` with `end && mapper(data)`, the `mapper` function
