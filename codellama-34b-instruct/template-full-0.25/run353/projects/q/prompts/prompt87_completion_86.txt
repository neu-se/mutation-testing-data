  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `f` is a function call, while `f + 1` is an arithmetic operation that adds 1 to the result of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `f` is a function call, while `f * 2` is an arithmetic operation that multiplies the result of the function call by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `f` is a function call, while `f - 1` is an arithmetic operation that subtracts 1 from the result of the function call.

DONE.
