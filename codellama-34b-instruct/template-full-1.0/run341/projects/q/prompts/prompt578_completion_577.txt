  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(
```
This would result in the `continuer` function being called with the `arg` parameter, which would cause the function to execute the `when` method passing the `arg` as a promise. This would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, which would execute the `when` method on the `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in the `continuer` function being called with the `arg` parameter and the `Q.reject` function as the first argument, which would cause the `when` method to be called on the `Q.reject` function, resulting in an error. This would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, which would execute the `when` method on the `result.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in the `continuer` function being called with the
