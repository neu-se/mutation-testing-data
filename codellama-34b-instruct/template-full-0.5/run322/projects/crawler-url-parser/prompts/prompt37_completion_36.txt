  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, regardless of the input. By replacing it with `false`, the function would always return `false`, which would cause the test to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return a boolean value, while `null` would return a null value. This could cause the test to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return a boolean value, while `undefined` would return an undefined value. This could cause the test to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the function.

DONE.
