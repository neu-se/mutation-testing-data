  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `temp` as is, while this modified code fragment adds 1 to the value of `temp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `temp` as is, while this modified code fragment multiplies the value of `temp` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `temp` as is, while this modified code fragment divides the value of `temp` by 2.

DONE.
