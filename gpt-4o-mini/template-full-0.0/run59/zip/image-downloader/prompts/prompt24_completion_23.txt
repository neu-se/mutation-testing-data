Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./default/destination'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed relative path for `options.dest`, which may not point to the intended destination, potentially leading to file write errors or overwriting files in an unintended location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join('..', options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the destination to a parent directory of the current directory, which could lead to unexpected file placements outside the intended directory structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `options.dest` to the last segment of the URL path instead of the intended destination path, which could result in saving the file with an incorrect name or in an incorrect location.

DONE.
