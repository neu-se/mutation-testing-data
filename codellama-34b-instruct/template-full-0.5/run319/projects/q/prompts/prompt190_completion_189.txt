  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first capture group instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the third capture group instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the entire match instead of the second capture group.

DONE.
