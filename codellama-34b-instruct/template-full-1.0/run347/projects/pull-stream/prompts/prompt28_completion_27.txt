  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid object property, and would throw an error if used as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid object property, but it would not have the same behavior as `ref[0]` since it would not be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"string"` is not a valid object property, and would throw an error if used as a function.

DONE.
