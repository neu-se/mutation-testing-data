  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180, 2) + 1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the tangent of the latitude, while this code fragment computes the square of the latitude. This would cause errors in the calculation of the y coordinate in the `toTile` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + 1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the tangent of the latitude, while this code fragment computes the sine of the latitude. This would cause errors in the calculation of the y coordinate in the `toTile` function.
