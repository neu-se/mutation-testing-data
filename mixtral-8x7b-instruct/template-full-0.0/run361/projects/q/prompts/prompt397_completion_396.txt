 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, while `Q(promise).thenResolve` returns a new promise that is resolved with the same value as the input promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, while `Q(promise).thenResolve` returns a new promise that is resolved with the same value as the input promise. However, `Q.resolve` is the correct way to create a resolved promise in the Q library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(value, function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` takes additional arguments to handle fulfilled, rejected, and progressed states, while
