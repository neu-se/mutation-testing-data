  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a variable, and `aborted()` is a function call, which would cause a `TypeError` if `aborted` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a variable, and `aborted.foo` is a property access, which would cause a `ReferenceError` if `aborted` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a variable, and `aborted + 1` is an arithmetic operation, which would cause a `TypeError` if `aborted` is not a number.

DONE.
