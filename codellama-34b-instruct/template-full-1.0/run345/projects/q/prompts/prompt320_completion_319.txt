  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[0](args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different function, possibly one that is not intended to be called in this context, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function without passing any arguments, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(descriptor[op].apply);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the function to a different context, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
