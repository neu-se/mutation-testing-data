  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would flip the order of the arguments, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method would remove the last element of the array, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method would remove the first element of the array, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
