  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the value of src, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of src to uppercase, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the value of src on the '.' character and return the first part of the split, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

DONE.
