 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive an empty array as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments passed to the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive `thisp` as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments passed to the method. This change would break the intended functionality of passing arguments to the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive `null` as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments passed to the method. This change would break the intended functionality of passing arguments to the method, especially when the method expects a non-null value.

DONE.
