  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that is being passed as an argument to the `cb` function, while `null` is a constant value that is not a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that is being passed as an argument to the `cb` function, while `undefined` is a constant value that is not a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that is being passed as an argument to the `cb` function, while `acc + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `acc`.

DONE.
