  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would not be called with the `final` argument set to `true`, which would cause the regular expression to be compiled differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with an additional argument, which would cause the regular expression to be compiled differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with a different argument, which would cause the regular expression to be compiled differently.

DONE.
