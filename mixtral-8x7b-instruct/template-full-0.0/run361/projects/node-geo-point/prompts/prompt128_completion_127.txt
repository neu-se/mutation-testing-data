 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[this.latitude, this.longitude]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method expects two arguments (latitude and longitude), but it receives an array instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: this.latitude, longitude: this.longitude }
