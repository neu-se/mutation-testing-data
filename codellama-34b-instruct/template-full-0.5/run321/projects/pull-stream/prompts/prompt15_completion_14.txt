  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would always be 0, even if `args` is not null, which would cause the `if` statement to always be false and the `throw` statement to never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would always be greater than 0, even if `args` is null, which would cause the `if` statement to always be true and the `throw` statement to always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would always be 1, even if `args` is null or has a different length, which would cause the `if` statement to always be false and the `throw` statement to never be executed.

DONE.
