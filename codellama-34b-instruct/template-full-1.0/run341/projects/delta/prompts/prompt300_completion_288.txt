  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not increment the iterator at all, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the iterator by 1, potentially accessing a negative index.

DONE.
