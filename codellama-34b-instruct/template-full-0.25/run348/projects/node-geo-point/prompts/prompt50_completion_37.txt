  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude) - deg2rad(point1.longitude) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 360 would cause the resulting angle to always be positive, even if the points are on opposite sides of the globe.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude) - deg2rad(point1.longitude) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 360 would cause the resulting angle to always be negative, even if the points are on the same side of the globe.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude) - deg2rad(point1.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the resulting angle to be twice as large as it should be, leading to
