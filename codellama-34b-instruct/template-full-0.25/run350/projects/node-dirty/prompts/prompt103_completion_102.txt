  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value of the row, while `row.key` is the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + 1` is a different key than the original `row.key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key.toUpperCase()` is a different key than the original `row.key`.

DONE.
