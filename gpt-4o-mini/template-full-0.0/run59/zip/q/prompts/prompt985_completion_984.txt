Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.send
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.send` is likely a different method that does not handle the "post" operation in the same way as `this.dispatch`, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or failure to execute the intended operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the first argument from "post" to "get" alters the type of operation being performed, which may not be compatible with the expected behavior of the method, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.invoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.invoke` may refer to a different method that does not perform the same action as `this.dispatch`, potentially resulting in a failure to properly call the intended method on the object.

DONE.
