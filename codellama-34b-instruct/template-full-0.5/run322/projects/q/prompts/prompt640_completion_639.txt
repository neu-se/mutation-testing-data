  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `post` method with the wrong number of arguments, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `get` method instead of the `post` method, potentially returning a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `set` method instead of the `post` method, potentially causing a different side effect.

DONE.
