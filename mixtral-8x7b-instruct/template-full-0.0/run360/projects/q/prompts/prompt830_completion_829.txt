 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `.fcall` directly invokes the node-style callback with the node-style resolver, while `.then` schedules the node-style callback to be invoked asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply
