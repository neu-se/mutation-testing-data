  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sin` function to receive the wrong argument, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad - point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sin` function to receive a different argument, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sin` function to receive a different argument, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
