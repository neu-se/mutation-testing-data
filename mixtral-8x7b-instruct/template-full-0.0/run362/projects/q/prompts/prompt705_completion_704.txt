 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method in the prototype chain would receive an empty array as the `args` parameter instead of the expected arguments, causing incorrect behavior when the bound function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method in the prototype chain would receive `null` as the `args` parameter instead of the expected arguments, causing incorrect behavior when the bound function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method in the prototype chain would receive an object with a `length` property set to 0 instead of an actual array, causing incorrect behavior when the bound function is called.

By introducing these changes, we can expose potential issues in the test suite that may not be effectively covering the edge cases related to the `fbind
