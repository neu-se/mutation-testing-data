  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object would have a different value for the `value` property, which could cause the code that uses the returned object to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object would have a different value for the `value` property, which could cause the code that uses the returned object to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object would have a different value for the `value` property, which could cause the code that uses the returned object to behave differently.

DONE.
