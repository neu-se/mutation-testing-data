 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end) {
    return sink.abort()
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is truthy, but this code checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`. This means that if `end` is a non-empty string or a non-zero number, the `sink.abort()` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end) {
    throw new Error('Stream ended')
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `sink.abort()` when the stream ends, but this code throws an error instead. This could cause the program to terminate prematurely or behave unexpectedly.
