  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the retain property of the otherOp instead of thisOp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the retain property of thisOp is not a number instead of being a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the retain property of thisOp is undefined instead of being a number.

DONE.
