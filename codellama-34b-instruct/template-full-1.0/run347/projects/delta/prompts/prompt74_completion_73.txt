  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: null };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property of the previous op to `null`, which would cause the `retain` method to throw an error when trying to access the `retain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: undefined };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property of the previous op to `undefined`, which would cause the `retain` method to throw an error when trying to access the `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: newOp.insert };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property of the previous op to the value of the `insert` property of the current op, which would cause the
