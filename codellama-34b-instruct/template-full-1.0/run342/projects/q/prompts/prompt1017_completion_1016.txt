  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is not a valid method for the `dispatch` function, and would result in an error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail(nodeback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is not a valid method for the `this` object, and would result in an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is not a valid method for the `deferred` object, and would result in an error being thrown.

DONE.
