  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the next operation in the iterator, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.peek()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the peeked operation in the iterator, rather than the length of the current operation.

DONE.
