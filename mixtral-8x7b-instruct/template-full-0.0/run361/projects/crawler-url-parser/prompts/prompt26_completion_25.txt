 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the entire hash fragment, instead of just the part after the first '#' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[?#].*/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the query string and hash fragment entirely, instead of just the hash fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all occurrences of the hash fragment in the string, instead of just the first one.

DONE.
