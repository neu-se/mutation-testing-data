  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const invalidPolicy
```
This would result in different behavior because `invalidPolicy` is not defined, so the loop will not execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy_
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy_` is a different variable than `policy`, so the loop will not execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = policy
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `policy`, so the loop will not execute.

DONE.
