 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, rather than the end using `push`. This could cause issues in the rest of the code that relies on the order of the elements in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.length = ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `length` property of the `ops` array directly, instead of adding a new element. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code, as it might not be prepared to handle this kind of modification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops[ops.length] = newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns a new value to the last index of the `ops` array, without using the `push` method. This could cause issues
