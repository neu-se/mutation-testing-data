  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to never be called, even if the `abort` signal is received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a null value, even if the `abort` signal is not received.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with an undefined value, even if the `abort` signal is not received.

DONE.
