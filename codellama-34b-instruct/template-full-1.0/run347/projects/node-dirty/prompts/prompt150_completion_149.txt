  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, and replacing it with `null` would cause the function to not be called at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, and replacing it with an anonymous function that does not accept any arguments and returns `undefined` would cause the function to be called with incorrect arguments and return a different result.

DONE.
