 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` callback would not be called when the promise is settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` callback would not be called and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` callback would not handle progress notifications and simply return the value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
