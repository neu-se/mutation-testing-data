  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete2"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would be replaced with a non-existent operator, causing a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would be replaced with the `set` operator, which would change the meaning of the code and cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would be replaced with the `post` operator, which would change the meaning of the code and cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
