  Option1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `Q.done` method with an explicit `undefined` argument, which may have different effects depending on the implementation of the method.

Option2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.done(9000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `Q.done` method with an arbitrary value, which may have different effects depending on the implementation of the method.

Option3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.done("Hello, world!")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `Q.done` method with a string argument, which may have different effects depending on the implementation of the method.

DONE.
