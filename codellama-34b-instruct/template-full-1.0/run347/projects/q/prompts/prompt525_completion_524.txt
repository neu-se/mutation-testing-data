  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will coerce the operands to numbers, whereas the original `op` would have left them unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would negate the operand, whereas the original `op` would have left it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the operands, whereas the original `op` would have left them unchanged.

DONE.
