  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the baseOp, rather than the attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the baseOp's attributes, rather than the attributes themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the baseOp, rather than the attributes.

DONE.
