  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback will not be called, unlike the original code fragment, which will call `done` if the `if` condition is met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` will be called with `null` as its first argument, unlike the original code fragment, which would call `done` with `end` as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` will be called with a string as its first argument, unlike the original code fragment, which would call `done` with `end` as its first argument or nothing at all if `end === true`.

DONE.
