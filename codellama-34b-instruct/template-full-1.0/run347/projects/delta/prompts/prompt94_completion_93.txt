  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for `newOp` and would cause `push` to return `null` instead of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` would cause `push` to throw an error, which is not handled by the original code and would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops` is an array, and `push` would push a new op onto the array, which would change the state of the object.

DONE.
