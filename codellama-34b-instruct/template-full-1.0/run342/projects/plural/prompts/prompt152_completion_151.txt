  Option 1: The PLACEHOLder can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `num` variable is used to determine whether the input word should be pluralized or not. By adding 1 to `num`, the pluralization would always occur, regardless of whether the input word is singular or plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLder can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `num` variable is used to determine whether the input word should be pluralized or not. By subtracting 1 from `num`, the pluralization would never occur, regardless of whether the input word is singular or plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLder can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `num` variable is used to determine whether the input word should be pluralized or not. By multiplying `num` by 2, the pluralization
