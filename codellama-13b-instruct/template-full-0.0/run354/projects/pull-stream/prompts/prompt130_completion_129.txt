  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called with a value, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a value of `null`, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a value of `true`, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
