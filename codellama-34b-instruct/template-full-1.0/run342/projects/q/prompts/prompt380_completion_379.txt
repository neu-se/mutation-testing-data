  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Q.get(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.get()` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first promise that is resolved, while `Q` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the first promise that is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.thenResolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve()` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first promise that is resolved, while `Q` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the first promise that is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){return Q(promise)}, function(){return Q(promise)})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the first promise that is resolved, while `Q` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the first promise
