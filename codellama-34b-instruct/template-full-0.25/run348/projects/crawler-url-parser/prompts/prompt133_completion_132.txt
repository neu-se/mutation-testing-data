  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code fragment uses a backslash. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code fragment does not include any characters. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code fragment uses a space. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
