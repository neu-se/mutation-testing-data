  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the reason as an error, while the modified code fragment would return a rejected promise with the reason as the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the reason as an error, while the modified code fragment would return a resolved promise with the reason as the resolution value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the reason as an error, while the modified code fragment would return a rejected promise with the reason as the rejection reason.

DONE.
