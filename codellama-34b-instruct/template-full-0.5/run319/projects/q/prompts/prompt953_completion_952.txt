  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `fail` method to handle the rejection of the promise, while the modified code fragment uses `reject` method to reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `fail` method to handle the rejection of the promise, while the modified code fragment uses `then` method to handle both the fulfillment and rejection of the promise.
