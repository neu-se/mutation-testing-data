  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with `null` instead of `end`, which could cause the callback function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with `false` instead of `end`, which could cause the callback function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with `undefined` instead of `end`, which could cause the callback function to behave differently.

DONE.
