  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'button'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only selects links with the "a" tag, while this new code fragment would select buttons with the "button" tag instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.link'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only selects links with the "a" tag, while this new code fragment would select elements with a class of "link" regardless of their tag name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a:not([href^="https:"])'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code selects all links with an "a" tag, while this new code fragment would select links with an "a" tag that do not have an "href" attribute with a value that starts with "https:".

DONE.
