  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for specifying the URL of an image or other media, and it is not typically used for hyperlinks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'text'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` attribute is used for specifying the text content of an element, and it is not typically used for hyperlinks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + 'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `href` and `src` attributes, which would result in an invalid URL.

DONE.
