  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the truthiness of the `domain` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `domain` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will coerce the `domain` variable to a number, which may result in a different value than the original `domain` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined for the `domain` variable, which is an object. This would cause an error to be thrown when the code is executed.

DONE.
