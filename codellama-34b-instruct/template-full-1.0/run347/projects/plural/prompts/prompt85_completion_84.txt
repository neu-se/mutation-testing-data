  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the algorithm will now pluralize the word "mouse" as "mice" instead of "mouses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the algorithm will now pluralize the word "mouse" as "mouses" instead of "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mous', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the algorithm will now pluralize the word "mouse" as "mous" instead of "mice".

DONE.
