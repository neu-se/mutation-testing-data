  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object is an array with a length of 2, while the new code fragment checks if the length of the `coordinates` property is not equal to 2. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the `coordinates` property is not an array or if it has a length other than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object is an array with a length of 2, while the new code fragment checks if the `coordinates` property is not an array. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the `coordinates` property is not an array, even if it has a length of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
