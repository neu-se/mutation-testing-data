  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with potentially multiple properties, while the new code fragment `{}` is an empty object with no properties. This could cause the `getAllTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with potentially multiple properties, while the new code fragment `null` is a null value with no properties. This could cause the `getAllTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object with potentially multiple properties, while the new code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value with no properties. This could cause the `getAllTimezones` function to return a different set
