  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, but replacing it with `null` would result in `null` being passed as the first argument to the `read` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently or even throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a variable, but replacing it with `abortCb` would result in a different variable being passed as the second argument to the `read` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently or even throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a variable, but replacing it with `next` would result in a different function being passed as the second argument to the `read` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently or
