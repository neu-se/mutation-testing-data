 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` always returns a new fulfilled promise, while `promise.then` returns a promise that is fulfilled or rejected based on the original promise's state. This change would cause the `allSettled` method to always return an array of fulfilled promises, even if the original promises were rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random floating-point number, while `promise.then` returns a promise that is fulfilled or rejected based on the original promise's state. This change would cause the `allSettled` method to return an array of promises that are either fulfilled with random values or rejected, depending on the state of the original promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array(10).fill(null)
```
