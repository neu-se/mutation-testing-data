  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This change would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length and order of elements, potentially leading to different behavior in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 0, deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to a specific index in an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This change would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length and order of elements, potentially leading to different behavior in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element
