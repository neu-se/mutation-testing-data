  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 1 + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `index` by 2 instead of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to `index` instead of incrementing it directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double `index` instead of incrementing it by 1.

DONE.
