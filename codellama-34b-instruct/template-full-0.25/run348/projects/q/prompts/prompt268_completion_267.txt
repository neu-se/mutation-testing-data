  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object with the reason as the message, whereas the original code would simply reject with the reason as the rejection value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason + "!")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the reason with the string "!", whereas the original code would simply reject with the reason as the rejection value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the reason, whereas the original code would simply reject with the reason as the rejection value.

DONE.
