Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to increment the value retrieved from the `_data` map, which could lead to unexpected results if the value is not a number or if the key does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) || 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return a default string `'default'` if the key does not exist in the `_data` map, instead of returning `undefined`, which changes the expected output of the `update` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key) ? this.get(key) : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `null` if the key does not exist, instead of returning the current value associated with the key, which could lead to different outcomes in the update logic.

DONE.
