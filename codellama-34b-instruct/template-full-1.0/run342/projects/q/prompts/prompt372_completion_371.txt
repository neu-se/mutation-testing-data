  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(e)` would cause the promise to be rejected with the error `e`, whereas `Q.onerror(e)` would simply call the `onerror` function on the `Q` object, but not reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `Q.onerror` handler to `null`, which would prevent any errors from being reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(`${e}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.onerror` function with the string representation of the error `e`, whereas the original code called it with the error object itself.

DONE.
