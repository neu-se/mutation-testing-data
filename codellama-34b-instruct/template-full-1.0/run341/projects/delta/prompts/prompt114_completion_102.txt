  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the predicate function to always return false, which would then cause the filter method to not include any of the elements in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the predicate function to always return null, which would then cause the filter method to include all of the elements in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the predicate function to always return an empty object, which would then cause the filter method to not include any of the elements in the resulting array.

DONE.
