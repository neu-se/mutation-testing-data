  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `Math.sin()` without the `Math` prefix, which would have resulted in a different function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `Math.sin()` to calculate the sine of a number, while `Math.cos()` would calculate the cosine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `Math.sin()` to calculate the sine of a number, while `Math.tan()` would calculate the tangent of a number.

DONE.
