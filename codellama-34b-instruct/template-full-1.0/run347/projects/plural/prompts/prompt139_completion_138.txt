  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append an "s" to the word, regardless of whether it is a proper noun or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word[0] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only append an "s" to the first character of the word, and not the entire word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase() + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the word before appending an "s", which would result in a different plural form.

DONE.
