  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be null instead of the function context object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be the global object (or undefined in strict mode) instead of the function context object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be an empty object instead of the function context object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
