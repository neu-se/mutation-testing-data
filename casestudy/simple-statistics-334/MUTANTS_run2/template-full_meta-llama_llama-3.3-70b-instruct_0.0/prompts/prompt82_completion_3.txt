Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the left index instead of the right index, potentially causing the `quantileSelect` function to operate on the wrong portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the right index one position to the right, potentially causing the `quantileSelect` function to operate on a different portion of the array or even go out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(indices[r] / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use half of the right index, potentially causing the `quantileSelect` function to operate on a much smaller portion of the array than intended, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
