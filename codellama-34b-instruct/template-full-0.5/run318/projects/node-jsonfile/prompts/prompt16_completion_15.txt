  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFile` and `_writeFile` are different functions with different implementations. `_readFile` reads a file and returns its contents as a string, while `_writeFile` writes a file with the given contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_readFile`, which means it will block the event loop until the file is read. In contrast, `_readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means it will block the event loop until the file is written. In contrast, `_writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

DONE.
