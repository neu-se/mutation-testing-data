Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is greater than zero instead of checking if it is equal to zero, which would lead to different results when `a` is negative or zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not equal to zero, which would cause the function to return `Math.log(_b)` when `a` is any non-zero value, instead of only when `a` is exactly zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `a` and `b` are zero, which would change the logic of the function and potentially lead to different handling of cases where only one of the variables is zero.

DONE.
