  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 10 to the latitude value before using it in the calculation, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the latitude value before using it in the calculation, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
