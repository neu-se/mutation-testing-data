  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compared `b` to zero, while this replacement compares `b` to a positive number. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is negative, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compared `b` to zero, while this replacement compares `a` to `b`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` and `b` are equal, which is not the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compared `b` to zero, while this replacement compares `b` to inequality with zero. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`
