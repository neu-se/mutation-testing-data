  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<span> This is a new span element</span>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new span element would be inserted into the DOM, which would affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<div id="newDiv"></div>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new div element would be inserted into the DOM, which would affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<div id="newDiv">TEXT</div>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new div element with the specified id and text content would be inserted into the DOM, which would affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
