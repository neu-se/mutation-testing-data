  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `aborted` value to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment is passing `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `aborted` value to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment is passing `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `aborted` value to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment is passing `0`.

DONE.
