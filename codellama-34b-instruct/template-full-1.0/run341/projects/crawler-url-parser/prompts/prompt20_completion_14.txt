  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//\.test(str
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if a string starts with "//" using a regular expression, but this replacement would test if the string starts with "//" and the letter "t".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:(?!^|\-|\.)).*?(?!\/)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if a string starts with "//" using a regular expression, but this replacement would check if a string starts with any character except "/", "-", "." or "\n" using a negative lookahead assertion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^http:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if a string starts with "//" using a regular expression, but this replacement would check if a string starts with "http://".

DONE.
