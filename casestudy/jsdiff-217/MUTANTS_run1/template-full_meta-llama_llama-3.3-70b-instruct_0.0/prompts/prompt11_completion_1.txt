Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/([^\S\r\n]+)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only split on whitespace characters (excluding newline), but would not consider other non-word characters like parentheses, brackets, or quotes as token boundaries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split on word boundaries, which could lead to incorrect tokenization of punctuation attached to words, or words separated by non-word characters other than whitespace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[\r\n]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only split on newline characters, treating all other characters (including whitespace and non-word characters) as part of the same token, which could lead to incorrect tokenization of text with multiple spaces or other non-word characters between words.

DONE.
