  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the callback, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the callback, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
