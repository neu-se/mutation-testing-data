  Sure, I can help you with that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function that takes one argument, but in the original code, it is not called with any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort()` is a function that should not be called if `onAbort` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a boolean value that is used as a condition for executing the `cb` function, but calling `onAbort()` would execute the function instead of checking its value.

DONE.
