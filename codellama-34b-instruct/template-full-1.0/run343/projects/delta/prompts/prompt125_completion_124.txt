  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (start < 0) return iter.next(end - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code correctly handles the case where `start` is negative, but this replacement would cause an out-of-bounds access when `start` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index >= end) break;
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code correctly handles the case where `index` is greater than or equal to `end`, but this replacement would cause an infinite loop in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < 0) index = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code correctly handles the case where `index` is negative, but this replacement would cause the iterator to start over from the beginning of the array when `index` is negative.

DONE.
