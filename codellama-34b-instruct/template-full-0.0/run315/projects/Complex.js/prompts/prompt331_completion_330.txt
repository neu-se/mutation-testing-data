  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is not equal to 0, which would result in the `return` statement being executed and the function returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to 0, which would result in the `return` statement being executed and the function returning a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in
