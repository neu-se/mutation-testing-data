  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing the real part of the complex number instead of multiplying it, which could lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing the imaginary part of the complex number instead of multiplying it, which could lead to a different result.

DONE.
