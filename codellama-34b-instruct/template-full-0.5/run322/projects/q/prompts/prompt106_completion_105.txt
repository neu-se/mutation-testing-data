  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, and would iterate backwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a random index in the array instead of the first, and would potentially visit the same index multiple times.

DONE.
