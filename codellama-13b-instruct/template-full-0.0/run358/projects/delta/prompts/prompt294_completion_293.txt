  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `next()` method to return the next operation in the delta, rather than the operation at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the `next()` method to return the previous operation in the delta, rather than the operation at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `next()` method to return the operation at the specified index multiplied by 2, rather than the operation at the specified index.

DONE.
