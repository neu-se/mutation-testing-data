  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(Number(bearing))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which would change the final result of `calculateDestination`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `bearing`, which would alter the final result of `calculateDestination`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `Ï€` to the value of `bearing`, which would change the final result of `calculateDestination`.

DONE.
