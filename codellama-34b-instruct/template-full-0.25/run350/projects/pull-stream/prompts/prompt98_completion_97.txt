  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment calls the callback function with the error as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment calls the callback function with the error as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error as both arguments, whereas the original code fragment calls the callback function with the error as the second argument.

DONE.
