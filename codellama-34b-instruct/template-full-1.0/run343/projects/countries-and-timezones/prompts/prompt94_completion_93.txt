  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"INVALID_ID", {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of the expected `country` object, causing an error in the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a `country` object with `deprecated` set to `true`, causing the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return a different set of `timezones`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() > 0.5 ? countryId : "INVALID_ID"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a random `country` object (either the actual `country` object or `null`), causing an error in the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.
