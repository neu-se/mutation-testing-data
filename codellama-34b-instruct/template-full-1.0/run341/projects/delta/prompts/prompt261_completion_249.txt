  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.prototype.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.prototype.compose` is a different method than `AttributeMap.prototype.diff`, and it would cause the `diff` method to use the wrong implementation, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.prototype.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.prototype.transform` is a different method than `AttributeMap.prototype.diff`, and it would cause the `diff` method to use the wrong implementation, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.prototype.isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.prototype.isEqual` is a different method than `AttributeMap.prototype.diff`, and it would cause the `diff` method to use the wrong implementation, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
