  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(object, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op].apply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `op` method on the `object` with the `args` arguments, whereas the original code would call the `op` method on `object` with the `args` arguments and then call the `dispatch` function with the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `op` method on the `object` with the `args` arguments, whereas the original code would call the `op` method on `object` with the `args` arguments and then call the `dispatch` function with the result.

DONE.
