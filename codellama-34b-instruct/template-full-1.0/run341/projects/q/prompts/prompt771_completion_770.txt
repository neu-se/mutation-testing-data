  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Original code:
Q(promises).allSettled()

// Mutated code:
Q(promises).all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a method that returns an array of states for the respective promises, while `all` is a method that returns a promise for an array of resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Original code:
Q(promises).allSettled()

// Mutated code:
Q(promises).resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a method that returns an array of states for the respective promises, while `resolve` is a method that returns a promise for the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Original code:
Q(promises).allSettled()

// Mutated code:
Q(promises).reject()
```
This would result
