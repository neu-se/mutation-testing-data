  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` parameter is not used in the original code, but is used in the modified code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not used in the original code, but is used in the modified code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl.url` property is not used in the original code, but is used in the modified code.

DONE.
