  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the value to be incremented, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the value to be decremented, which would also change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the value to be doubled, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
