Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `next` method to proceed with a length greater than zero, potentially returning an operation even when a length is specified, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would restrict the `next` method to only accept a length of 1, which could cause it to behave incorrectly when a different length is intended, leading to incomplete operations being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `next` method to treat any defined length (including zero) as valid, which could lead to returning operations even when the intention was to treat an undefined length as a signal to use the default behavior of `Infinity`.

DONE.
