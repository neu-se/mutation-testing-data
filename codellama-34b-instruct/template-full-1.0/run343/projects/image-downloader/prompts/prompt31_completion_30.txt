  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimLeft()` with a non-zero argument will remove exactly that number of characters from the beginning of the string, whereas the original code fragment used `trimLeft()` with no arguments, which removed all whitespace characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` would remove exactly one character from the end of the string, whereas the original code fragment used `trimLeft()`, which removed characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` would remove the first character of the string, whereas the original code fragment used `trimLeft()`, which removed all whitespace characters from the beginning of the string.

DONE.
