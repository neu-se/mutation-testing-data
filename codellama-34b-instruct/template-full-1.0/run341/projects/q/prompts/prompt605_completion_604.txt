  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given value, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a variable that contains the result of the `Q.async` function, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that resolves the promise.

DONE.
