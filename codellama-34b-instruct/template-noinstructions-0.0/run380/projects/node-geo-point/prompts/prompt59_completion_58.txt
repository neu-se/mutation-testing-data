  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use the latitude of the starting point instead of the ending point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the ending point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use the longitude of the destination point instead of the ending point.

DONE.
