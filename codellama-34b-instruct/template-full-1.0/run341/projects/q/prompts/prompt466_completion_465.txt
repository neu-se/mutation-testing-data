  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is different from the `!==` operator. The `>` operator returns `true` if the left operand is greater than the right operand, while the `!==` operator returns `true` if the operands are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is different from the `!==` operator. The `<` operator returns `true` if the left operand is less than the right operand, while the `!==` operator returns `true` if the operands are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is different from the `!==` operator. The `+` operator returns the result of adding the operands, while the `!==` operator returns `
