  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the `Math.sqrt()` function would be flipped, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.sqrt()` function would be changed, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.sqrt()` function would be changed, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
