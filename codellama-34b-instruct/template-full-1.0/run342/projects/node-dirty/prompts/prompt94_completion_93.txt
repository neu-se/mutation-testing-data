  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `JSON.parse` is a function that parses a string as JSON, while `1 + 1` is an expression that evaluates to 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `JSON.parse` returns an object, while `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `JSON.parse` returns an object, while `null` is a value that represents the absence of any object value.

DONE.
