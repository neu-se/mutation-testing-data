 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would return a resolved promise instead of the original promise. The original code uses `Q(callback)` to create a promise from the callback, allowing the callback to return a promise that will be awaited. By replacing it with `Promise.resolve`, the returned promise would not wait for the callback's promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` has additional guarantees compared to the original `then` method. The `when` function ensures that the `fulfilled` and `rejected` callbacks are called only once, either one of them is called but not both, and they will not be called in the same turn. The original `then` method does not provide these guarantees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different
