 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add any element to the `collect` array, and the `map` function would return an empty array instead of the expected mapped values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add the number `1` to the `collect` array as many times as the length of the input array, instead of adding the mapped values. The `map` function would return an array filled with `1`s instead of the expected mapped values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add an array containing all arguments passed to the `map` function (including the `callback`, `thisp`, and `self` variables) to the `collect` array, instead of adding the mapped values.
