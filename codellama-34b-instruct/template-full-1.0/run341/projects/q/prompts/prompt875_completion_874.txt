  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called with any argument, which means that the returned promise is not resolved with the expected value. In the original code, the `defer` function is called with the `TypeError` object, which causes the promise to be rejected with the corresponding error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with the argument `42`, which means that the returned promise is resolved with the value `42`. In the original code, the `defer` function is called with the `TypeError` object, which causes the promise to be rejected with the corresponding error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(function(resolve, reject) {
    reject(new Error('Not a promise'));
});
```
