  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if a value is a promise-like object, which may not be the same as checking if it's a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` would check if the value is not a promise, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseLike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseLike` is a different function that checks if a value is promise-like, which may not be the same as checking if it's a promise.

DONE.
