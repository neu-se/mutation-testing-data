  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's a string. If `nextOp.retain` is a string, the replacement code would return `retain: length`, which is different from the original code that would return `retain: nextOp.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number or an object, but this replacement only checks if it's an object. If `nextOp.retain` is a number, the replacement code would return `retain: length`, which is different from the original code that would return `retain: nextOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain ===
