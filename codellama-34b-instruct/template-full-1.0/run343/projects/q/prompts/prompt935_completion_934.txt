  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` reverses the order of the array, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` filters the array based on a predicate function, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results or filter out important data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_fill
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_fill` fills the array with a specified value, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results or lose important data.

DONE.
