  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 1, while the new code fragment checks if 1 is not equal to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 1, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 1, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1.

DONE.
