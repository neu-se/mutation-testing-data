Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is strictly equal to `null`, which would cause the function to call `cb(true)` when `value` is `null`, instead of executing the callback with the `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality, which would evaluate to `true` for both `null` and `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if `value` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is not strictly equal to `null`, which would cause the function to call `cb(true)` when `value` is any value other than `null`, including `undefined`, `0`, or an empty string.

DONE.
