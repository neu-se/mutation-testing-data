  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(word, num) {
  return word + 's';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a more complex algorithm to determine the plural form of a word, while this code fragment always appends an 's' to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(word, num) {
  return word.slice(0, -1) + 'ies';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a more complex algorithm to determine the plural form of a word, while this code fragment always replaces the last letter of the word with 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(word, num) {
  return word.slice(0, -1) + 'es';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a more complex algorithm to determine the plural form of a word, while this code fragment always
