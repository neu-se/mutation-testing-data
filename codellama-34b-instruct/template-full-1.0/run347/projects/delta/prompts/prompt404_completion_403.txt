  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the data being passed to the `otherData` variable, potentially causing the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(otherData....0)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the structure of the code, potentially causing the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~ otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the data being passed to the `otherData` variable, potentially causing the method to behave differently.

DONE.
