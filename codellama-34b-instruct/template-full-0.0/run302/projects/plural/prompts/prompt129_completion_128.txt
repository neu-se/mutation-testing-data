  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the variable `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the variable `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to iterate over more or fewer elements than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the variable `i` to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to iterate indefinitely.

DONE.
