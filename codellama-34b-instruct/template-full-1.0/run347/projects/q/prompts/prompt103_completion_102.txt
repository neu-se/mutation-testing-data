  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] === value
```
This would result in different behavior because if `this[index]` is not strictly equal to `value`, the code in the generator loop would not be executed, whereas in the original code, it would be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] != value
```
This would result in different behavior because if `this[index]` is strictly equal to `value`, the code in the generator loop would not be executed, whereas in the original code, it would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] % value === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `this[index]` is not divisible by `value`, the code in the generator loop would not be executed, whereas in the original code, it would be executed.

DONE.
