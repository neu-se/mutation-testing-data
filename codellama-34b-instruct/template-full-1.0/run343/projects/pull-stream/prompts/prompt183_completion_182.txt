  Option 1:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while the mutated code is only checking if it is greater than. So the mutated code would return `true` for a shorter array than the original code fragment would.

Option 2:
```
i <= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while the mutated code is only checking if it is less than or equal to. So the mutated code would return `true` for a longer array than the original code fragment would.

Option 3:
```
i !== array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while the mutated code is only checking if it is not equal to the length. So the mutated code would return `true` for an array with a different length
