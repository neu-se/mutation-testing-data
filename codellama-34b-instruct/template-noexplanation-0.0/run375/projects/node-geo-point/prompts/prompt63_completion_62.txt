  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to use the latitude of the starting point instead of the ending point, which will result in an incorrect bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 180
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to add 180 degrees to the calculated bearing, which will result in an incorrect bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to double the calculated bearing, which will result in an incorrect bearing value.

DONE.
