 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the abort behavior would not be triggered when `abort` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the abort behavior would not be triggered when `abort` is a non-empty string or a non-zero number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
