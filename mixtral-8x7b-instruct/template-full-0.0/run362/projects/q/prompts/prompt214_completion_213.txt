 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value && value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `value` and `value.then` exist, but doesn't verify if `value.then` is a function. The original code uses the `instanceof` operator to ensure `value` is a Promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value !== null && value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows `value` to be any non-null object with a `then` property, even if it's not a Promise. The original code checks if `value` is an instance of Promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `value.then` is a function, but doesn't verify if `value` is a Promise. The original code uses the `instanceof` operator to ensure `value
