  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.parent` is not the same as `ctx`, and could potentially lead to a different evaluation of the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.child
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.child` is not the same as `ctx`, and could potentially lead to a different evaluation of the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.sibling
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.sibling` is not the same as `ctx`, and could potentially lead to a different evaluation of the policy.

DONE.
