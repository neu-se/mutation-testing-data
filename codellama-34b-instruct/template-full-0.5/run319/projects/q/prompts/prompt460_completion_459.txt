  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the `untrackRejection` function was not called, which would result in the unhandled rejection being tracked indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the `untrackRejection` function was called with a different promise than the one being tested, which would result in the wrong promise being removed from the list of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at !== -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the `untrackRejection` function was called with a different promise than the one being tested, which would result in the wrong promise being removed from the list of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
