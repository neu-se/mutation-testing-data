  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the callbacks from the queue, rather than adding them as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method would remove all callbacks from the queue, rather than adding the new callbacks as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would create a shallow copy of the callbacks array, rather than adding the new callbacks as intended.

DONE.
