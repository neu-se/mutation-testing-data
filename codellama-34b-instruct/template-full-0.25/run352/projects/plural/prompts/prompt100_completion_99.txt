  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always return the string "a", regardless of the input word, whereas the original code fragment would return the input word with the letter "e" replaced by "es" if the word ended in "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always return the string "es", regardless of the input word, whereas the original code fragment would return the input word with the letter "e" replaced by "es" if the word ended in "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' + 's' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always return the string "ess", regardless of the input word, whereas the original code fragment would return the input word with the letter "e" replaced by "es" if the word ended in "e
