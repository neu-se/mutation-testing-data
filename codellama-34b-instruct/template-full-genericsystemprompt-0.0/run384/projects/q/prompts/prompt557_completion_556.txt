  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter is not being passed to the `generator[verb]` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter is being passed twice to the `generator[verb]` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter is being passed three times to the `generator[verb]` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
