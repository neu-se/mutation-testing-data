  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. In the context of the code, `Math.sqrt` would cause the function to return the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
