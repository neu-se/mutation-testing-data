  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the values are not equal, regardless of whether they are deeply equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the values are not equal and not deeply equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== b[key] && typeof a[key] !== typeof b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the values are not equal, not deeply equal, and have different types.

DONE.
