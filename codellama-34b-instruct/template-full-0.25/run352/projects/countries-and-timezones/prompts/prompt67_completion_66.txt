  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `options` object to the `countries[id]` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] - options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the `options` object from the `countries[id]` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] * options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `countries[id]` object by the `options` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
