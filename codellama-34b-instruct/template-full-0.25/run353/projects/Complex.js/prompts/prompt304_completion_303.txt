  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable name, while `b` is a different variable name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable name, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable name, while `Math.sin(a)` is a function call that calculates the sine of `a`.

DONE.
