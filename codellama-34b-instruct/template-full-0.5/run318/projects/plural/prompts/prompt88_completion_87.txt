  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "people" to refer to a group of individuals, while the new code fragment uses the word "persons" to refer to a group of people.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'humans'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "people" to refer to a group of individuals, while the new code fragment uses the word "humans" to refer to a group of people.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'individuals'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "people" to refer to a group of individuals, while the new code fragment uses the word "individuals" to refer to a group of people.

DONE.
