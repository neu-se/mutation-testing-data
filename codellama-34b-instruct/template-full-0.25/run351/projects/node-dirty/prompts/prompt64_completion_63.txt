  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy` is a method that closes the stream immediately, whereas `end` is a method that waits for all data to be written before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` takes an optional error argument that is emitted as an error event on the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('Test data')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `end` is a method that closes the stream.

DONE.
