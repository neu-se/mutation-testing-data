  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` are not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which would cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `args` array and the `op` string, which would cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to a different value than the original code.

DONE.
