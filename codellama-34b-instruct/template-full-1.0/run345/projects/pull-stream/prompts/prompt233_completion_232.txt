  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test && !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `data` is falsy, but this new code checks whether `test` is truthy and `data` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `test` is falsy, but this new code checks whether `test` is truthy and `data` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `test` is falsy, but this new code checks whether `test` is truthy or `data` is truthy.

DONE.
