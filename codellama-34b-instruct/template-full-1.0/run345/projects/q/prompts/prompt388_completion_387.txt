  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q(value).then` creates a fulfilled promise with the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a fulfilled promise, whereas `Q(value).then` creates a fulfilled promise with the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.check(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.check` throws an error if the value is not a promise or a thenable object, whereas `Q(value).then` simply creates a new promise.

DONE.
