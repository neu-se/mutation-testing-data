  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to delete the value associated with the key "null" instead of the original key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to delete the value associated with the key "keya" instead of the original key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' + key
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to delete the value associated with the key "keykey" instead of the original key.

DONE.
