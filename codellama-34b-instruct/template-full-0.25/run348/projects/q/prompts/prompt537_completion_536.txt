  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `spread` method, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed to the `spread` method, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed to the `spread` method, which would cause an error.

DONE.
