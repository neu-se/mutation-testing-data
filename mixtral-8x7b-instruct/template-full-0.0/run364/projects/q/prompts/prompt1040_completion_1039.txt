 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return { promise: Q.defer() }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new object with a deferred promise is created every time `put` is called, causing the previous head and tail to be lost.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
