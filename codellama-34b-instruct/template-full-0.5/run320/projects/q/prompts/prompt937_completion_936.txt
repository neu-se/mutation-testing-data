  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` would be initialized with an empty array instead of the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` would be initialized with an array containing the value `3` instead of the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` would be initialized with the length of the `baseArgs` array instead of the expected arguments.

DONE.
