  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the stringify function would produce a different output when the encoding is changed from 'utf8' to 'utf16'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the stringify function would produce a different output when the encoding is changed from 'utf8' to 'ascii'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the stringify function would produce a different output when the encoding is changed from 'utf8' to 'base64'.

DONE.
