  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to `null`, which is not the same as the original code which returns a promise that resolves to `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Q(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, which is not the same as the original code which returns a promise that resolves to `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Q(null, object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to `null`, which is not the same as the original code which returns a promise that resolves to `object`. Additionally, the function would be passed an additional argument `object` which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
