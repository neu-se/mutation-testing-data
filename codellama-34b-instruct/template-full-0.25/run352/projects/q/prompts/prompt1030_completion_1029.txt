  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `nodeback` function, and it would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `nodeback` function, and it would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string, and it would cause the `nodeback` function to be called with a string argument, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
