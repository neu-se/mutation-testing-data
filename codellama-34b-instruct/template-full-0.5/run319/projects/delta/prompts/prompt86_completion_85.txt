  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.retain` is a number, and `lastOp.attributes` is an object, so the comparison would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.delete` is a number, and `lastOp.attributes` is an object, so the comparison would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `lastOp.attributes` is an object, so the comparison would always be false.

DONE.
