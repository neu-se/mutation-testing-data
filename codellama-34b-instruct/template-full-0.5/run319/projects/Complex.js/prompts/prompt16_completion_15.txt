  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest of two numbers, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
