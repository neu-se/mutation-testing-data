Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Parsing error");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of silently handling the error, it would throw an exception, potentially causing the program to crash or halt execution, which is different from the original behavior of just exiting the parser.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': NaN, 'im': NaN };
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `parser_exit()`, it would return a complex number with both real and imaginary parts as NaN, which could lead to further calculations being performed on invalid data, unlike the original behavior that would stop execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': 0, 'im': 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 1, which is a valid complex number, instead of indicating an error, thus changing the expected output of the parser function.

DONE.
