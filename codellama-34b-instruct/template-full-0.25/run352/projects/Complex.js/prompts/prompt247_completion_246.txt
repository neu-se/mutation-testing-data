  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which would lead to a different calculation of the sine and cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which would lead to a different calculation of the sine and cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the imaginary part of the complex number, which would lead to a different calculation of the sine and cosine.

DONE.
