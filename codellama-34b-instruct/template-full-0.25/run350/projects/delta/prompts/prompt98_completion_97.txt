  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `newOp` would be set to the string `'foo'`, rather than the value of the `arg` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of `newOp` would be set to the object `{ foo: 'bar' }`, rather than the value of the `attributes` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to the number `10`, rather than the value of the `length` parameter.

DONE.
