  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(0, -1), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the rejection from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(1), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the rejection from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(0, 1), promise

This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not properly remove the rejection from the array.

DONE.
