  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(baseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string. In the original code, `URL.format` is used to format the URL parts, but using `URL.resolve` instead would result in a different URL being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(URL.resolve(baseUrl, parsedUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` expects a URL string as input, whereas `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL object. Using `URL.parse` on the output of `URL.resolve` would result in a different URL being parsed than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.stringify(URL.parse(URL.resolve(baseUrl, parsedUrl)))
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.stringify` returns a string representing
