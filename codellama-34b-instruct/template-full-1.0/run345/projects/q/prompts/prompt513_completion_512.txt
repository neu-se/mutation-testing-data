  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("some error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the async function to throw an error, instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject("some error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the async function to return a rejected promise, instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the async function to return a promise that is fulfilled with the value `undefined`, instead of the fulfilled promise returned by the original code.

DONE.
