  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called instead of the `throw` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of an error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called instead of the `throw` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` method would be called instead of the `throw` method, which would cause the generator to return a value instead of an error being thrown.

DONE.
