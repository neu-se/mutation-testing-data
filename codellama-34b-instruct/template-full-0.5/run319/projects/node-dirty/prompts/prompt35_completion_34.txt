  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the key is deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'foo', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `'foo'` is a different value than `undefined`, and would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the key is updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the key is updated, as it would not provide a value for the key.

DONE.
