  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the method being called, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method being called to one that does not exist, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method being called to one that expects only one promise to be fulfilled, which would cause an error.

DONE.
