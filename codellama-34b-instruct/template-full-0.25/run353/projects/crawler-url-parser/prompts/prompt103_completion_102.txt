  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, causing the condition to always be true, even if the text is already included in the `tmpUrl.text` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method is used instead of `includes`, which would return -1 if the text is not found in the `tmpUrl.text` string, causing the condition to always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method is used on the `text` string, causing the condition to always be true if the text is included in the `tmpUrl.text` string, regardless of the case.

DONE.
