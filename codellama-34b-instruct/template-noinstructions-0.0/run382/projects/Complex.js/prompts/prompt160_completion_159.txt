  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the method to not be called correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the method to not be called correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the method to not be called correctly.

DONE.
