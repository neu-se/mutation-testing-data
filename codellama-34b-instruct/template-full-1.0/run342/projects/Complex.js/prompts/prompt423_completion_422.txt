  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `this['isInfinite']()`, causing the `if` statement to always be executed, regardless of the value of `this['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` is not always guaranteed to be non-zero, so the `if` statement would not always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the summation of `this['re']` and `this['im']` is not always guaranteed to be non-zero, so the `if` statement would not always be executed.

DONE.
