  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to skip the first operation in the `other` delta and concatenate the remaining operations instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to concatenate all the operations in the `other` delta, including the first operation, instead of just the remaining operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to concatenate all the operations in the `other` delta, except for the first operation, instead of just the remaining operations.

DONE.
