Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!link || flagsNum & O_EXCL
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the link does not exist or when the O_EXCL flag is set, instead of throwing an error when the link exists and the O_EXCL flag is set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link &&!(flagsNum & O_EXCL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the link exists and the O_EXCL flag is not set, instead of throwing an error when the link exists and the O_EXCL flag is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link && flagsNum & O_RDONLY
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the link exists and the O_RDONLY flag is set, instead of throwing an error when the link exists and the O_EXCL flag is set, which could lead to incorrect handling of file operations.

DONE.
