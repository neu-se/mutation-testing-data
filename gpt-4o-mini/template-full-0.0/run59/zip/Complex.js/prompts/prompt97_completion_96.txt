Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because it provides a specific error message instead of the generic exit, which could lead to different handling of errors in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exit the parser without any condition, potentially allowing invalid inputs to be processed further instead of stopping execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Parsing error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an exception instead of calling `parser_exit()`, which may allow the error to be caught and handled differently in the surrounding code.

DONE.
