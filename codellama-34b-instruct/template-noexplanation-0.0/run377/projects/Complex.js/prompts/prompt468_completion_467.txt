  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to always return a positive imaginary part, even if the original value was negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b <= 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to always return a negative imaginary part, even if the original value was positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to always return a zero imaginary part, regardless of the original value.

DONE.
