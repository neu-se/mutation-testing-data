  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, even if `err` was set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, even if `err` was set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, even if `err` was set to `true`.

DONE.
