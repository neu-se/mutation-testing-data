  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test` is a function that takes a single argument, whereas `tester` is an object that contains multiple functions, including `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test()` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `tester` is an object that contains multiple functions, including `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test(data)` is a function call that takes a single argument `data` and returns a boolean value, whereas `tester` is an object that contains multiple functions, including `test`.

DONE.
