Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index from `0` to `1`, causing the substring to omit the first character of the word instead of the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the ending index to `w.length - 3`, which would remove the last three characters of the word instead of the last two, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the ending index to `w.length`, which would return the entire string without removing any characters, thus not applying the intended pluralization rule.

DONE.
