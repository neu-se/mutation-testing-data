  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldNotThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shouldThrow` property is not defined, so the `else` block would be executed, resulting in the function returning `null` instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldNotThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shouldThrow` property is not defined, so the `else` block would be executed, resulting in the function returning `null` instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would flip the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, so the `if` block would be executed when `shouldThrow` is `false`, and the `else` block would be executed when `shouldThrow` is `true`.

DONE.
