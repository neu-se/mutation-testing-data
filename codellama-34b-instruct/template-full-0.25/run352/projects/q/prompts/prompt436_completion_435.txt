  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the promise is in the array, while this code checks if the promise is at an index greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the promise is in the array, while this code checks if the promise is not in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the promise is in the array, while this code checks if the promise is at an index less than 0.

DONE.
