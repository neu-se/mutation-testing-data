  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.define
```
This code fragment checks if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property, and if that property has a `define` method. This is a more specific check than the original code fragment, which only checked if `define` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.require
```
This code fragment checks if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property, and if that property has a `require` method. This is a more specific check than the original code fragment, which only checked if `define` is a function.
