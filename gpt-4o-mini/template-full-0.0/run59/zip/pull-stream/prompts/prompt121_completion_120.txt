Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return source(null, function (end, data) { cb(null, acc) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately calls the callback `cb` with `null` as the error and the current accumulator `acc`, bypassing the intended data processing logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return sink(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to pass `data` to `sink`, which is not the intended use, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors since `sink` expects a function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return source(end, function (end, data) { acc = null })
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `acc` to `null` regardless of the incoming `data`, effectively discarding any accumulated value and leading to incorrect results in subsequent operations.

DONE.
