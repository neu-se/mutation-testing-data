  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -100 || latitude > 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is now being compared to -100 and 100 instead of -90 and 90. This would cause the constructor to throw a RangeError for any valid latitude value that is greater than 100 or less than -100.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is now being compared to -180 and 180 instead of -90 and 90. This would cause the constructor to throw a RangeError for any valid longitude value that is greater than 180 or less than -180.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radius > 6371e3
```
This would result in different behavior because the radius value is now being compared to
