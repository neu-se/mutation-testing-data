  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to check if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to be modified, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to be modified, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
