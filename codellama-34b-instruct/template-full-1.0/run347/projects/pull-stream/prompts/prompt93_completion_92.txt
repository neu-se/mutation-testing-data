  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<null,null>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the first argument is `null`, but the new code fragment always returns `null` as the first argument, regardless of the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<false,data>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the first argument is `true`, but the new code fragment always returns `false` as the first argument, regardless of the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<!data,null>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the first argument is falsy, but the new code fragment always returns the negation of the `data` variable, regardless of its falsy or truthy value.

DONE.
