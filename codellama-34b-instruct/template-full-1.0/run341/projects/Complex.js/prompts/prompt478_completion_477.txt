  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this['im']` is finite, while this new code checks if it is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this['im']` is finite, while this new code checks if it is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this['im'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this['im']` is finite, while this new code checks if it is a number.

DONE.
