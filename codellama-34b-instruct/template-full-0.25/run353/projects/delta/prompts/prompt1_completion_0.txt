  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` would check if `a` is null or undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === undefined` would check if `a` is undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a` would check if `a` is falsy, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
