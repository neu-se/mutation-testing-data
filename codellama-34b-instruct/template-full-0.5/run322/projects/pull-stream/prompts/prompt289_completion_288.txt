  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `unique` function, causing the `nonUnique` function to pass through items that were previously filtered out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique.bind(null, field)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that is bound to the `null` context and the `field` parameter, causing the `nonUnique` function to pass through items that were previously filtered out.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field => !unique(field)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function creates a new function that takes a `field` parameter and returns the negation of the result of the `unique` function, causing the `nonUnique` function to pass through items that were previously filtered out.

DONE.
