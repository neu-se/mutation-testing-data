  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new NodeResolver object and passes it to the `nodeArgs` array, while the buggy code fragment does not create a new NodeResolver object and instead passes the `deferred` object directly to the `nodeArgs` array. This could cause issues with the promise chaining and the handling of errors.

```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
