  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: true });
```
This code fragment will call the `buildCountry` function with an additional argument, which will cause the function to return a different result. This can help to test the robustness of the code that uses the `buildCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: false });
```
This code fragment will call the `buildCountry` function with a different argument, which will cause the function to return a different result. This can help to test the robustness of the code that uses the `buildCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, {});
```
This code fragment will call the `buildCountry` function with a different argument, which will cause the function to return a different result. This can help to test the robustness of the code that uses the `buildCountry` function.

DONE.
