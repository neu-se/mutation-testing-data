  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `definition` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `define`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(definition)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the `definition` function to the console, rather than defining it as a module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, rather than defining the `definition` function.

DONE.
