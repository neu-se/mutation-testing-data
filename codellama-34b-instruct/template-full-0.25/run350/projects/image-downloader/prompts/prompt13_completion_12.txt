  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI's reserved characters, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes all encoded characters, including those in the query string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes all characters, including those in the query string, whereas `decodeURIComponent` only decodes the URI's reserved characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` is called on the `pathname` variable, which is a string, whereas `decodeURI` is called on the `url` variable, which is a `URL` object.

DONE.
