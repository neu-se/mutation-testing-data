  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is not a number. If `op.retain` is a number, the original code would return `op.retain`, while this code would return `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is greater than 0. If `op.retain` is a number, the original code would return `op.retain`, while this code would return `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is an object
