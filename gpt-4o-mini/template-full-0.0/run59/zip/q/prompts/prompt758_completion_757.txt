Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to be incorrectly referenced as `allSettled`, leading to confusion and potentially incorrect promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled()"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call `allSettled` as a function instead of referencing it as a string, which would lead to a runtime error since `allSettled` is not a callable function in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the reference from `allSettled` to `all`, which would cause the function to resolve promises differently, potentially leading to incorrect promise resolution behavior.

DONE.
