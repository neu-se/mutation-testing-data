 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be rejected with a new `Promise.reject` instance, instead of propagating the original rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function would return `undefined` instead of propagating the original rejection reason, causing the returned promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Buggy behavior')
