  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(<foo>).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(<foo>).fapply()` would create a new promise that resolves with `<foo>`, while in the original code, `Q(callback)` creates a new promise that resolves with `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object[<property>]).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is not yet defined in the original code, but `object` is defined as an argument in the function signature.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(function () {}).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q()` creates a new promise that resolves with the return value of the provided function, while in the original code, `Q(
