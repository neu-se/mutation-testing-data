  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(bound).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` always returns a resolved promise, whereas the original code uses `Q()` which returns a promise that may be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(42).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(42)` creates a promise that is already resolved with the value `42`, whereas the original code uses `Q(bound)` which creates a promise that may be resolved or rejected depending on the outcome of the `bound()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(function () {}).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(function () {})` creates a promise that is immediately resolved, whereas the original code uses `Q(bound)` which creates a promise that may be resolved or rejected depending on the outcome of the `bound()` function.

DONE.
