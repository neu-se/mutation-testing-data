  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called immediately, which would cause all of the promises to be rejected immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Throw new Error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Return Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would cause the `onRejected` function to be called.

DONE.
