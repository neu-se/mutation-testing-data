  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'drain'` event when the write stream is not draining, while the replaced code would emit an `'error'` event in the same situation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'drain'` event when the write stream is not draining, while the replaced code would emit an `'end'` event in the same situation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'drain'` event when the write stream is not draining, while the replaced code would emit a `'close'` event in the same situation.

DONE.
