This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the `a` element, while this new code fragment uses the `attr` method to set the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').removeAttr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the `a` element, while this new code fragment uses the `removeAttr` method to remove the `href` attribute from the
