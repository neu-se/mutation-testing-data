  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if the `url` property is not defined in the `options` object, which would cause the function to return a rejected promise with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if the `url` property is `null`, which would cause the function to return a rejected promise with an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if the `url` property is an empty string, which would cause the function to return a rejected promise with an error message.

DONE.
