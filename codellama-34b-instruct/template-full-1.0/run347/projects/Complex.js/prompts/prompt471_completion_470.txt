  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `re` component to be 0, instead of `im` component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `re` component to be not 0, instead of `im` component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `im` component to be -1, instead of 0.

DONE.
