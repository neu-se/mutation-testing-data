  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and the function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, and the `null` value would be passed to the `cb` function, which could cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, and the `data` value would be passed to the `cb` function, which could cause an error.

DONE.
