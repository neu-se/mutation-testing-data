  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the current URL, which could potentially change the URL's hostname or path, leading to different parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http", "https")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "http" protocol with "https", which could potentially change the URL's protocol, leading to different parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." subdomain from the URL, which could potentially change the URL's hostname, leading to different parsing results.

DONE.
