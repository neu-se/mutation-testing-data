  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value, so the condition `rejected` will evaluate to `false` and the `untrackRejection` function will not be called, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, so the condition `rejected` will evaluate to `true` and the `untrackRejection` function will be called, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a promise that is already fulfilled, so the condition `rejected` will evaluate to `false` and the `untrackRejection` function will not be called.

DONE.
