  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with the message of the exception, rather than the exception itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with the stack trace of the exception, rather than the exception itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a new error object that has the same message as the original exception, rather than the original exception itself.

DONE.
