  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the `iter` object, which is an instance of the `OpIterator` class. In the original code, the `next()` method is not called, so the iterator is not advanced. By calling `next()`, the iterator is advanced, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is called on the `iter` object, which is an instance of the `OpIterator` class. In the original code, the `peek()` method is not called, so the iterator is not advanced. By calling `peek()`, the iterator is advanced, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the `iter
