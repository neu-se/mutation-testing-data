  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the path to be uppercased before being passed to the `matches` method, which could potentially change the result of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the path to be truncated before being passed to the `matches` method, which could potentially change the result of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the path to be split into an array of strings and the last element of the array would be returned, which could potentially change the result of the method.

DONE.
