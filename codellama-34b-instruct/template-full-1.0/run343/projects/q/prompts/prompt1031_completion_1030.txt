  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `Q.nextTick` function with the `nodeback` function as an argument, while the new code fragment calls it with `undefined, undefined` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment conditionally calls the `nodeback` function with `null` as an argument, while the new code fragment always calls it with `true` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Date.now()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `Q.nextTick` function with the `nodeback` function as an argument, while the new code fragment calls it with the current timestamp returned by the `Date.now()` function as an argument instead.

DONE.
