  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause it to return without memoizing any timezone. This would cause the `getTimezone` function to return `null` for any timezone name, even if the timezone exists in the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with the timezone object that was already created by the `buildTimezone` function, instead of creating a new timezone object. This would cause the `getTimezone` function to return the same timezone object for any timezone name, even if the timezone exists in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name].name);
```
This would result in different behavior
