Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.push` adds an element to the end of the array instead of adding an element to the beginning, which changes the order of the elements when the array is processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop` removes the last element from the array instead of adding to the beginning, which would lead to a loss of data and potentially incorrect results when the array is used later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.shift` removes the first element of the array instead of adding to the beginning, which alters the contents of the array and can lead to unexpected results when the remaining elements are processed.

DONE.
