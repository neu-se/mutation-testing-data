  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push `newOp` to the end of the array instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unshift `newOp` to the beginning of the array instead of the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would splice `newOp` at index 0, which would insert it at the beginning of the array instead of the end.

DONE.
