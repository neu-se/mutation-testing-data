  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.host` and `ret.url` would not be equal anymore, which could affect the `if (currentUrl.url) {` condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.querycount
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.host` and `ret.querycount` would not be equal anymore, which could affect the `if (currentUrl.url) {` condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.text
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.host` and `ret.text` would not be equal anymore, which could affect the `if (currentUrl.url) {` condition.

DONE.
