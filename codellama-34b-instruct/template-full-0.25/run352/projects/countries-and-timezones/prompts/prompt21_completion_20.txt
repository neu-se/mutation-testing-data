  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because `!tz.d` would always be `false`, even if `tz.d` is not a number, whereas `Number.isInteger` would return `false` if `tz.d` is not an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d % 1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.d % 1 === 0` would check if `tz.d` is an integer, whereas `Number.isInteger` would check if `tz.d` is an integer and also handle cases where `tz.d` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof tz.d === 'number' && tz.d % 1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof tz.d === 'number' && tz.d % 1 === 0` would check if
