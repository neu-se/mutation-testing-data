  Sure, I can help you with that. Here are three options for changing the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `1, name`. This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an invalid first argument (1) which would cause the function to throw an error.
```
buildTimezone(1, name)
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `undefined, name`. This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an undefined first argument which would cause the function to throw an error.
```
buildTimezone(undefined, name)
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null, name`. This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with a null first argument which would cause the function to throw an error.
```
buildTimezone(null, name)
```
DONE.
