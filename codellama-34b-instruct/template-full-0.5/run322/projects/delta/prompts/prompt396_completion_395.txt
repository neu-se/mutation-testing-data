  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a boolean value that indicates whether the operation is a retain operation, whereas `otherOp.delete` is a number that represents the number of characters to delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the operation, whereas `otherOp.delete` is a number that represents the number of characters to delete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a string that represents the text to insert, whereas `otherOp.delete` is a number that represents the number of characters to delete.

DONE.
