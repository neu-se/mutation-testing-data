  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.parent` is a different object than `ctx`, and the `query` method of the `Policy` class may have different behavior when called with a different `ctx` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.parent.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.parent.parent` is a different object than `ctx.parent`, and the `query` method of the `Policy` class may have different behavior when called with a different `ctx` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.parent.parent.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.parent.parent.parent` is a different object than `ctx.parent.parent`, and the `query` method of the `Policy` class may have different behavior when called with a different `ctx` object.

DONE.
