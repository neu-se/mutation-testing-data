  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be applied to the length of the `rowStr` string, rather than the string itself. This would cause the condition to pass if `rowStr` is an empty string, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be applied to the result of the `includes` method, which checks if `rowStr` contains an empty string, rather than checking if `rowStr` is an empty string. This would cause the condition to pass if `rowStr` contains an empty string, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.search(/^$/) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the regular expression pattern
