  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `this['isInfinite']()`, causing the expression to evaluate to `true` when the original expression would have evaluated to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` if either `this['isInfinite']()` or `z['isInfinite']()` evaluated to `true`, whereas the original expression would only evaluate to `true` if both expressions evaluated to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `z['isInfinite']()`,
