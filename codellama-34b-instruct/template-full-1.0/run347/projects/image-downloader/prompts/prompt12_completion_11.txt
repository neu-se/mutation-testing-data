  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the pathname from the URL instead of the basename of the destination filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the parent directory of the destination filename instead of the basename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(path.basename(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decode the basename of the destination filename using `decodeURIComponent` instead of `path.basename`.

DONE.
