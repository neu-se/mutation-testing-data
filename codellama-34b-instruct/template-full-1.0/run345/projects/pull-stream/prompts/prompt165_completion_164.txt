  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return onAbort(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `onAbort` would be called with the parameters `cb` and `abort`, but the original code fragment called `abortCb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return abortCb (cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `abortCb` would be called with the parameters `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort`, but the original code fragment did not include the `onAbort` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return abortCb (cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `abortCb` would be called with the parameters `cb` and `abort`, but the original code fragment did not include the `onAbort` parameter.

DONE.
