  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2dreg
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is used to convert radians to degrees, but `deg2rad` is used to convert degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.PI * Number(bearing) / 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different formula to calculate the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(Number(bearing) * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `sin` instead of `cos` to calculate the bearing.

DONE.
