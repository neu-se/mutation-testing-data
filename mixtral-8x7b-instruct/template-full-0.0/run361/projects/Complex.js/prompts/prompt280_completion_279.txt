 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the cosecant of `a` instead of using the sine of `a`. This change breaks the calculation of the cosine function for complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of `b` instead of the cosine of `a`. This change breaks the calculation of the cosine function for complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the tangent of `a` instead of using the cosine of `a`. This change breaks the calculation of the cosine function for complex numbers.

These changes would introduce bugs in the `cos` function, making it return incorrect results for complex numbers. The developers would need to update the tests
