  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `otherIter.next(PLACEHOLDER)` function to consume twice as many elements from the other delta's ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` is incremented by 1, which would cause the `otherIter.next(PLACEHOLDER)` function to consume one more element from the other delta's ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` is decremented by 1, which would cause the `otherIter.next(PLACEHOLDER)` function to consume one less element from the other delta's ops array.

DONE.
