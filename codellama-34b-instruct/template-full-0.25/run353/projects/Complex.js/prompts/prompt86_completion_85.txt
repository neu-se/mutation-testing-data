  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === ' ' || isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and not NaN, while the replaced code fragment checks if the next token is a space or NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and not NaN, while the replaced code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and NaN.
