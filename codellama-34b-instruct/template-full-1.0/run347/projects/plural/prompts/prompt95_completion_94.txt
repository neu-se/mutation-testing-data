  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex is removed, which would cause the regex to match the word "woman" but not "Woman" or " WoMan."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?\w+/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\w+` part of the regex would match any word character, including digits and underscores, whereas the original regex only matches the word "wo" followed by a "man."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the "i" flag at the end of the regex is replaced with "g", which would cause the regex to match the whole word "woman" regardless of its position in the string.

DONE.
