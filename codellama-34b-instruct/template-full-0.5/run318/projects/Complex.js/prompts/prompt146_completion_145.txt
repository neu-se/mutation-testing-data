  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when `a` and `b` are both zero, while the replaced code returns `Complex['ZERO']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when `a` and `b` are both zero, while the replaced code returns `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when `a` and `b` are both zero, while the replaced code returns `Complex['NAN']` for any input.

DONE.
