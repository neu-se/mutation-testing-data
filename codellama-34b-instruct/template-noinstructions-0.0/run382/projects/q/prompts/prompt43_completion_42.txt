  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a delay of 1 millisecond instead of 0, which could cause the task to be executed later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a negative delay, which would cause the task to be executed immediately instead of being queued.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a null delay, which would cause the task to be executed immediately instead of being queued.

DONE.
