  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* 99
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize()` method of `archiver` expects a callback function, but `99` is a variable that is not a function and will cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize()` method of `archiver` expects a callback function, but `'foo'` is a string and will not be treated as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* () => console.log('bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize()` method of `archiver` expects a callback function that takes two arguments: `err` and `bytes`, but the function provided here takes no arguments.

DONE.
