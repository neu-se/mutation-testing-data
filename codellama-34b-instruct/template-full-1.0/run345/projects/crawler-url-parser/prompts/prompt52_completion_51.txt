  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol === 'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the protocol of the parsed URL is "http:", which is not necessarily the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the path of the parsed URL is "/", which is not necessarily the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the search query of the parsed URL is empty, which is not necessarily the case.

DONE.
