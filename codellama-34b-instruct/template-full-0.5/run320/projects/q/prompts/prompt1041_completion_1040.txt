  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = next.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is replaced with `reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = function() {
    throw new Error("Can't resolve promise");
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is replaced with a function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = function() {
    return Q.reject(new Error("Can't resolve promise"));
};
