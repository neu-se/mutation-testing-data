  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is a method that unblocks the stream, allowing data to flow through, while `cork` blocks the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write an empty string to the stream, which would not have the same effect as writing the data from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write a null value to the stream, which would not have the same effect as writing the data from the queue.

DONE.
