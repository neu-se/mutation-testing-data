  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` are different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `0` have different types and can be treated differently in some situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `NaN` have different types and can be treated differently in some situations.

DONE.
