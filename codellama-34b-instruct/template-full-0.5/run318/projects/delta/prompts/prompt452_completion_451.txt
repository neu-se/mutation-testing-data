  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the iterator had a next element, while the new code fragment is calling the `hasNext()` method, which may have a different implementation and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the iterator had a next element, while the new code fragment is calling the `next()` method, which may have a different implementation and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the iterator had a next element, while the new code fragment is calling the `peek()` method, which may have a different implementation and behavior.

DONE.
