 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.nextTick.bind(process)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately invokes `process.nextTick` instead of using the `nodeArgs` array as the arguments for the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
