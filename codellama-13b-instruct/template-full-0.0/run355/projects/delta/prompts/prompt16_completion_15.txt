  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would return `undefined` if `b` is `null`, whereas the original code would return `b` if `b` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would return `undefined` if `b` is not an object or `null`, whereas the original code would return `b` if `b` is not an object or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would return `undefined` if `b` is `undefined`, whereas the original code would return `b` if `b` is `undefined`.

DONE.
