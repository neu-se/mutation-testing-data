  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value from `options`, and it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `options.deprecated`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated || options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated || options.country` is a different expression from `options`. It would evaluate to `true` if `options.deprecated` is `true` or `options.country` is truthy, and it would evaluate to `false` otherwise. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently depending on the value of `options`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.country` is a different object than `options`. It would cause the `if` statement to behave differently depending on the value of `options.
