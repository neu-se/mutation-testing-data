  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the length of the `ops` array minus one, rather than the length of the array itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the length of the `ops` array plus one, rather than the length of the array itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the length of the `ops` array multiplied by two, rather than the length of the array itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

DONE.
