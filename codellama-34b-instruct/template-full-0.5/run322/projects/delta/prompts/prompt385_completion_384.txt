  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `Math.min` function to return a different value, potentially leading to the `while` loop being executed more or fewer times than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `Math.min` function to return a different value, potentially leading to the `while` loop being executed more or fewer times than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `Math.min` function to return a different value, potentially leading to the `while` loop being executed more or fewer times than intended.

DONE.
