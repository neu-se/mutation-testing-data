 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes an empty array instead of using the existing `cbs` variable, causing issues with callback handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the queue value to null, causing issues with callback handling and potentially throwing errors when trying to use the `_queue.get(key)` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `this._queue` variable directly, causing issues with callback handling and potentially exposing internal data structures.

DONE.
