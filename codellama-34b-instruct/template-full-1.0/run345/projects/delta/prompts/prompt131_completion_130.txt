  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the next operation onto the `ops` array, whereas replacing it with `undefined` would result in the next operation not being pushed onto the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the next operation onto the `ops` array, whereas replacing it with `null` would result in the next operation being pushed onto the array, but with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: '' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the next operation onto the `ops` array, whereas replacing it with an object with an `insert` property set to an empty string would result in the next operation being pushed onto the array, but with an object with an empty string `insert` property.

DONE.
