  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because `NULL_CHARACTER` is a valid string, while `b` is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'foo'` is a string, while `b` is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number, while `b` is not defined in the code snippet.

DONE.
