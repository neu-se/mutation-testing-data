  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the asynchronous `writeFile` method to return a promise, while the replaced code calls the synchronous `writeFileSync` method, which does not return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `graceful-fs` library, which exports a `writeFile` method, while the replaced code uses the `fs` module, which does not export such a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `stringify` function to return a string, while the replaced code passes the string through `JSON.parse`, which returns a JavaScript object.

DONE.
