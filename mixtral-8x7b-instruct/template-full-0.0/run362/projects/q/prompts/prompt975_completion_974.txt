 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This could lead to unexpected results when dealing with arguments objects or other non-array iterables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.concat.bind(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses concat.bind(null, []) instead of array\_slice. This would create a new array with all the arguments, but it would not handle the spread of additional arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array prototype's slice method directly. This method requires that the context (this) is an array, which might not always be the case with nodeArgs.

DONE.
