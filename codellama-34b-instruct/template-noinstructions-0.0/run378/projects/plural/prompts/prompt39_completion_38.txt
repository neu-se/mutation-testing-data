  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "appendix" for the plural form of "appendix", while the new code fragment would return "appendices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'exes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "appendix" for the plural form of "appendix", while the new code fragment would return "appendices".
