  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is used instead of the `unshift` method, which would cause the callback to be added to the end of the list instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method is used instead of the `push` method, which would cause the callback to be added to the beginning of the list instead of the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.splice(0, 0, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method is used instead of the `push` or `unshift` methods, which would cause the callback to be added to the beginning of the list and shift the other elements down.

DONE.
