  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q.reject(new Error("Test error")));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
