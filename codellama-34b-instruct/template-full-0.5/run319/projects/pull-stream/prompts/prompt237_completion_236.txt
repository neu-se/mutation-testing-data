  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` function to be called recursively, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` function to return `null` instead of `data`, which could cause issues downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` function to return a different value than the original code, which could cause issues downstream.

DONE.
