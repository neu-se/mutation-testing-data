  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the `key` argument, while this code passes both the `key` and `value` arguments, which would likely cause the method to have a different impact on the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the property with the given key, while this code sets the property with the given key to the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code gets the property with the given key, while this code gets the property with the given value, which would likely result in a different property being accessed.

DONE.
