  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would not be called with the error object, and the error would not be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would not be called with the error object, and the error would not be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown immediately, rather than being passed to the `onerror` function.

DONE.
