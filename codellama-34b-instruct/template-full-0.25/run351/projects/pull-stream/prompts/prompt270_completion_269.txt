  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stream` variable is a function, rather than an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && 'function' === typeof stream.read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stream` variable is an object with a `read` method, rather than just checking if it's an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && 'function' === typeof stream.read && stream.read()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` method on the `stream` object, rather than just checking if it exists.

DONE.
