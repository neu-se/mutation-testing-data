Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${source} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `cssMapping.sourceRoot` prefix from the source URL, potentially changing how the source map is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${cssMapping.sourceRoot || ''}${source.toUpperCase()} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the source URL to uppercase, which may cause issues if the source map relies on case-sensitive URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${source.replace('/', '\\')} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces forward slashes with backslashes in the source URL, potentially changing how the source map is interpreted on different operating systems.

DONE.
