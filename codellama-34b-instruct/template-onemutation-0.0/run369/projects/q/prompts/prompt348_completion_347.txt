  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `rejected` callback with the `exception` as an argument, while the new code fragment would throw an exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an `UnhandledError` exception.
