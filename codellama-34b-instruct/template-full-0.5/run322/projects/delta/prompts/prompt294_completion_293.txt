  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current index and move to the next one, potentially missing a line in the process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move back to the previous index, potentially repeating the same line multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move forward twice as many indexes, potentially skipping over lines or repeating them.

DONE.
