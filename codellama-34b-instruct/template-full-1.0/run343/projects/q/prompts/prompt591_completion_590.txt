  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because the ES6 generators would not be supported, and the code would not be able to use Python-style generators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only work for some methods, and not all methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would work for any method, and not just the `mapply` method.

DONE.
