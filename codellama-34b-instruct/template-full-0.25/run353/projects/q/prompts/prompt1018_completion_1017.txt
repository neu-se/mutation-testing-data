  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it, causing the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with a specific error, while `null` would reject the promise with no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with a specific error message, while the original code would reject the promise with no error message.

DONE.
