  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses a different operator to subtract `offset` from `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it subtracts `offset` from `length` instead of `index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it subtracts `length` from `index` instead of `offset`.

DONE.
