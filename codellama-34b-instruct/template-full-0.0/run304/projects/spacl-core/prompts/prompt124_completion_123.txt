  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value that is not equal to any string, including `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `null` is a primitive value that is not equal to any string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `length` is a property that returns the number of characters in the string. If `match` is an empty string, then `match.length` would be 0, which is not equal to `null`.

DONE.
