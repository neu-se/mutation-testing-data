Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `replace` method to remove the last path component and any trailing slashes, while the new code would only remove the last path component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `replace` method to remove the last path component and any trailing slashes, while the new code would only remove the last path component.
