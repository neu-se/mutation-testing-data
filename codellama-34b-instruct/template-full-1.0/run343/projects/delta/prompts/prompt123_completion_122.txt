  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would execute one extra iteration, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would exit early, potentially resulting in a partial iteration of the collection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > end || !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would exit early if the `index` is greater than `end`, regardless of whether there are more elements in the collection.

DONE.
