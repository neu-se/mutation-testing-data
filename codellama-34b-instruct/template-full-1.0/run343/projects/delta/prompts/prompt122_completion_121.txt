  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `elem` would be null, which would cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `elem` would be undefined, which would cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `elem` would be an empty object, which would cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

DONE.
