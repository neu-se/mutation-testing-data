  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)` evaluates to 1, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(Math.PI / 2)` evaluates to 0, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

DONE.
