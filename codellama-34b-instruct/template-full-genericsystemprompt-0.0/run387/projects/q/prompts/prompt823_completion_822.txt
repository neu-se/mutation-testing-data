  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("This is a bug"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("This is a bug"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with an error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.

DONE.
