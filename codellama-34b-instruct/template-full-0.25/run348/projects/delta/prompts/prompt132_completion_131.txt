  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null value for `nextOp`, but `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a defined value for `nextOp`, but `undefined` would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero value for `nextOp`, but `0` would cause the loop to terminate early.

DONE.
