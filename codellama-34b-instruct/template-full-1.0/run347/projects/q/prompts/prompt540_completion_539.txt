  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different method than `apply`, and it would not pass the spread arguments to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, and it would not pass the spread arguments to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a method that rejects the promise, and it would not pass the spread arguments to the callback function.

DONE.
