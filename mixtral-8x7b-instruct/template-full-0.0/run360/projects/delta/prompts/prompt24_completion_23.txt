 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object when the value of `b[key]` is falsy (e.g. `null`, `0`, or `''`), instead of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always look for the key named "key" in the object `b`, instead of using the value of the variable `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<any>b)[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass TypeScript's type checking, allowing `b` to be any type, not just an `AttributeMap`.

DONE.
