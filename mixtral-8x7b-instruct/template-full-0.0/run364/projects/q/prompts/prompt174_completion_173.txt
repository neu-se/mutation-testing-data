 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"";
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is a falsy value, while the original code fragment is a truthy value. This could affect the behavior of any code that relies on the original fragment being truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a falsy value, while the original code fragment is a truthy value. This could affect the behavior of any code that relies on the original fragment being truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + "1";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the string "11", while the original code fragment is the number 1. This could affect the behavior of any code that relies on the original fragment being a number.

DONE.
