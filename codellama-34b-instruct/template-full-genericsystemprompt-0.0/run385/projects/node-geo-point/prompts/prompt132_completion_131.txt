  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude instead of the longitude for the tile calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different zoom level for the tile calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different zoom level for the tile calculation.

DONE.
