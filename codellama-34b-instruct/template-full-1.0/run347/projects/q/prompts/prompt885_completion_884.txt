  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the nodeArgs array to the makeNodeResolver method, which is used to create a promise that resolves with the function's return value. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with Q(null) would cause the makeNodeResolver method to be called with null instead of an array, which would result in a promise that resolves with the function's return value wrapped in a null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the nodeArgs array to the makeNodeResolver method, which is used to create a promise that resolves with the function's return value. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a function that doesn't take any arguments would cause the makeNodeResolver method to be called with a function that doesn't accept any arguments, which would result in a promise that resolves with the function's return value inside a function that doesn't accept any
