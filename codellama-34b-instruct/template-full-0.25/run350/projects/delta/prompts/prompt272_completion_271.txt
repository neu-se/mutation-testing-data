  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the iterator has a next element, while this replacement would always return true because it is calling the `hasNext()` method without checking its return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the iterator has a next element, while this replacement would always return the next element in the iterator, regardless of whether it exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the iterator has a next element, while this replacement would always return the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, which could result in an infinite loop if the iterator is not properly managed.

DONE.
