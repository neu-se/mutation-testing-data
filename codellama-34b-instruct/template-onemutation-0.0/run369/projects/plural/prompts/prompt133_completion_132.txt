  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` array contains pairs of regular expressions and corresponding replacement strings, and the first element of each pair is a regular expression that is used to match the input word. By using `rule[1]` instead of `rule[0]`, the regular expression would be ignored and the replacement string would be used directly, which could result in a different output for the `plural` function.
