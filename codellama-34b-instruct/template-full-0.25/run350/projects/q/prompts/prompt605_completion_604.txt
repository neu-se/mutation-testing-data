  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specified context and arguments, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one intended, and with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specified context and arguments, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one intended, and with different arguments.

DONE.
