  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `flush` function to be called with an incorrect argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with the incorrect argument `1`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with the incorrect argument `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
