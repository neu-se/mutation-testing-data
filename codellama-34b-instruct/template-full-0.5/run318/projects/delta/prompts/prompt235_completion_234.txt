  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an argument that is one more than the original code, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an argument that is one less than the original code, which would cause the iterator to skip over the previous element in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an argument that is twice as large as the original code, which would cause the iterator to skip over two elements in the iteration.

DONE.
