Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always select the first element of the slice, potentially leading to incorrect handling of embedded types if the first element does not match the expected type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation in the slice, which could lead to missing important data when inverting the operations, resulting in an incomplete or incorrect inverted Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the base operation instead of the current operation's length, which could lead to incorrect slicing and potentially cause the inversion logic to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
