  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This change will cause the `writeFileSync` function to use the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.throws
```
This change will cause the `writeFileSync` function to use the `throws` property of the `options` object as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.reviver
```
This change will cause the `writeFileSync` function to use the `reviver` property of the `options` object as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
