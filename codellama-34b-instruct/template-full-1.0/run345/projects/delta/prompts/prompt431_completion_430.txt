  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the falsiness of `length`, while the replaced code checks for strict equality with 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the falsiness of `length`, while the replaced code checks for `length` being greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the falsiness of `length`, while the replaced code checks for `length` being equal to `Infinity`.

DONE.
