  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Object`, and the `isObject` function would return `false` for `Object.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with no prototype, and the `isObject` function would return `false` for this object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function` is a different object than `Object`, and the `isObject` function would return `false` for `Function`.

DONE.
