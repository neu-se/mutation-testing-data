  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, starting from the second element. Therefore, the `for` loop would skip the first element in the `policies` array, and the `push` method would not add it to the `PolicyMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'admin')) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the given predicate function. In this case, the predicate function is `p => p.name !== 'admin'`, which means that the `for` loop would only iterate over the policies that do not have the name 'admin'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.map(p => p.name)) {
```
This would
