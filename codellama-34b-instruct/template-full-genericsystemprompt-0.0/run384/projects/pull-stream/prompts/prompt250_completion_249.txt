  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the stream to emit a `null` value instead of the expected `data` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `err` as the first argument, which would cause the stream to emit an error instead of the expected `data` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as both arguments, which would cause the stream to emit a `null` value instead of the expected `data` value.

DONE.
