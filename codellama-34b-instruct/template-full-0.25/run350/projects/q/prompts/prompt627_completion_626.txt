  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setValue"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setValue" is not a valid method for a promise object, while "set" is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setProperty" is not a valid method for a promise object, while "set" is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setter"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setter" is not a valid method for a promise object, while "set" is.

DONE.
