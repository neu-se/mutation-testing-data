  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match subdomains, not just the domain itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.baseurl == pageurl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match the baseurl of the link, not just the domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl === pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the entire link object is equal to the pageurl object, not just their domains.

DONE.
