  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `path[0]` would return the first character of the `path` string, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.length` would return the length of the `path` string, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.substring(1)` would return the `path` string starting from the second character, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

DONE.
