 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.has(key) ? this._data.set(key, val) : this._data.put(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object does not have a `put` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.set(key, val, { overwrite: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object does not have an `overwrite` option for the `set` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data['set'](key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `set` method as a property of the `_data` object, which would bypass any custom behavior or overrides on the
