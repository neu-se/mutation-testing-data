  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a strict less-than comparison, while the replacement code fragment uses a less-than-or-equal-to comparison. This means that the replacement code fragment would include the `start` index in the slice, while the original code fragment would not.
