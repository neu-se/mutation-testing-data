 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when the input is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the inverse cosine instead of the cosecant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(Math.cos(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces floating point errors due to the use of log and exp functions.

DONE.
