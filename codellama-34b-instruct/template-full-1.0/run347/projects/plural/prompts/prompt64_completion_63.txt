  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always append an 's' to the word, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'[0] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only append an 's' to the first letter of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'[Math.floor(Math.random() * 'bacteria'.length)] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an 's' to a random letter in the word.

DONE.
