  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to terminate earlier or later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the value of `j` instead of `i`, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different range of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different range of values.

DONE.
