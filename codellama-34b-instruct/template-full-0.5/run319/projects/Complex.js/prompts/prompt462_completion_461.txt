  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be compared with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be compared with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be compared with a different value.

DONE.
