  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would be "gese" instead of "geese", which would not be a valid plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would be "gooses" instead of "geese", which would not be a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would be "goos" instead of "geese", which would not be a valid plural form.

DONE.
