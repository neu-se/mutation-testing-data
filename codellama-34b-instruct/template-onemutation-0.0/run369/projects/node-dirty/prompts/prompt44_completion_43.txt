  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` is a method that removes a key and its value from the database, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key and its value in the database. Using `rm` instead of `set` would cause the `update` method to remove the key and its value from the database, rather than setting them.
