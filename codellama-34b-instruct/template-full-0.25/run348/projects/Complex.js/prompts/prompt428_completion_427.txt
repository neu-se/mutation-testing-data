  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `0` instead of `places || 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `0` instead of `places || 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `0` instead of `places || 0`.

DONE.
