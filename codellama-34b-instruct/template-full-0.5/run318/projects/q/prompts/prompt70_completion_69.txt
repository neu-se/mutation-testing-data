  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas the original code fragment `0` is a constant value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string value, whereas the original code fragment `0` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any value, whereas the original code fragment `0` is a specific value.

DONE.
