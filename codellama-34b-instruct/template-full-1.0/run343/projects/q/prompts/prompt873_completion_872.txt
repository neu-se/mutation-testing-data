  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would no longer be called, which would likely cause problems for the code that depends on the callback being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a value of undefined, which would likely cause problems for the code that depends on a valid function being passed as the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a no-op function, which would likely cause problems for the code that depends on a specific function being called.

DONE.
