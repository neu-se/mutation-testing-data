  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which inverts the truthiness of the expression. In this case, it would result in the opposite behavior of the original code fragment, where `!countries[id]` would evaluate to `true` if `countries[id]` is falsy, and `false` if it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `countries` object is falsy, rather than checking if the `id` property of the `countries` object is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property of the `countries` object is `undefined`, rather than checking if it is falsy.

DONE.
