  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a bound function, and calling it with `null` as the `this` value would lose the binding and potentially cause the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a bound function, and binding it again with `null` as the `this` value would create a new bound function with a different `this` value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a bound function, and applying it with `null` as the `this` value would cause the function to be called with `null` as the `this` value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
