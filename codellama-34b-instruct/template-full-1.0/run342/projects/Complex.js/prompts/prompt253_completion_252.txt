  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b - 1```
This would result in different behavior because `b-1` will always evaluate to a negative number, which may cause the function to return a wrong answer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```0```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant, which means it will have a different behavior than the original `b` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```null```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that is likely to cause a failure in the function, as it may cause a null pointer exception.

DONE.
