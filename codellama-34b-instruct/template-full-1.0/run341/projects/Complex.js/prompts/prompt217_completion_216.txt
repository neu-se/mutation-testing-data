  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * z['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` property is being referred to on the `z` object, which is not correct. The `arg` property should be a method that takes the `z` object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is being referred to on the `z` object, which is not correct. The `re` property should be a method that takes the `z` object as an argument.

DONE.
