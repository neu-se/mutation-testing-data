  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the inspected value as a progress notification, while this replacement would reject the promise with the inspected value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the inspected value as a progress notification, while this replacement would reject the promise with the inspected value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original value as a progress notification, while this replacement would reject the promise with the original value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

DONE.
