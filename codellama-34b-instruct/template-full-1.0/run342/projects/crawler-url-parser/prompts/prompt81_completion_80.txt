  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.src` is a different property than `a.href`, and may not contain the same value or have the same effects on the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href+1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a different element than `a.href` and may not contain the same value or have the same effects on the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href'.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract a substring from `a.href` that omits the first character, which may not have the same effects on the program.

DONE.
