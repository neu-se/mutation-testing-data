  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of the `inspect` function, which is an object with a `state` property, instead of the `inspected` variable, which is an object with a `state` property and a `reason` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspect(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `promise` object to the `inspect` function, which would likely cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspect(deferred.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `deferred.promise` object to the `inspect` function, which would likely cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
