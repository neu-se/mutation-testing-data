  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a `GeoPoint` instance as the second argument. However, passing `null` would cause the method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of the `null` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a `GeoPoint` instance as the second argument, but passing `this.longitude, this.latitude` would result in a `SyntaxError` due to the extra comma.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a `GeoPoint` instance as the second argument, but passing `point.longitude, point.latitude`
