  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb`, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. In contrast, the new code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb` that is initialized to an empty function. This change would cause the `cb` function to always return `undefined`, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => { throw new Error('Error'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb`, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. In contrast, the new code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb` that is initialized to a function that throws an error. This change would cause the `cb` function to always throw an error, which could potentially cause issues
