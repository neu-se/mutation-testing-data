  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `error` event to be emitted with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'dummy drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 'dummy read close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `read_close` event to be emitted with a different value.

DONE.
