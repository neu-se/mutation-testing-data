  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, which would result in the callback being called with `null` instead of `aborted`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, which would result in the callback being called with `null` instead of `aborted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'aborted'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'aborted'` is a truthy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the `if` block would be executed, which would result in the callback being called with `'aborted'` instead of `aborted`.
