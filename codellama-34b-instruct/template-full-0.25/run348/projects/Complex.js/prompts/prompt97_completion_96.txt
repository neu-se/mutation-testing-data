  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = z['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to `a['im']`, which is a different value than `z['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['re']` to `a['re']`, which is a different value than `z['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = z['re'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['re']` to `a['re']`, which is a different value than `z['re'] * 2`.

DONE.
