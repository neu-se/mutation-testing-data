  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw error` would throw the error object as an exception, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error(error)` would log the error to the console, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object.

DONE.
