  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset, length` would return the sum of `offset` and `length`, while the modified code fragment `offset + length` would return the product of `offset` and `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset, length` would return the difference between `offset` and `length`, while the modified code fragment `length - offset` would return the difference between `length` and `offset`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset, length` would return the remainder of `offset` divided by `length`, while the modified code fragment `offset % length` would return the remainder of `length` divided by `offset`.

DONE.
