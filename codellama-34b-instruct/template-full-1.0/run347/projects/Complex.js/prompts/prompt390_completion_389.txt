  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation is not present in the original code, and would cause the output to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `** 2` operation is not present in the original code, and would cause the output to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is not present in the original code, and would cause the output to be different.

DONE.
