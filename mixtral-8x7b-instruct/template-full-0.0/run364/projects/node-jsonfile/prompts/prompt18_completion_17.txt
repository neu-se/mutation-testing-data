 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `_fs` variable, which is the `graceful-fs` or `fs` module, depending on the try-catch block. This could cause issues if the `graceful-fs` module doesn't have the same methods or properties as the `fs` module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
