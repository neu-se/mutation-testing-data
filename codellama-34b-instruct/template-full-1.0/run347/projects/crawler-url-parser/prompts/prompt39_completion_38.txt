  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the protocol was not equal to 'http:' or 'https:', while the replaced code fragment only checks if the protocol is not equal to 'https:'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the protocol was not equal to 'http:' or 'https:', while the replaced code fragment only checks if the protocol is not equal to 'http:'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != 'http://www.example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the protocol was not equal to 'http:' or 'https:', while the replaced code fragment only checks if the host is not equal to 'http://www.example
