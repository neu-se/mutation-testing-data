  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sin function and the cos function are two distinct mathematical functions, and using one instead of the other would return different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because the random function would generate a random number between 0 and 1, whereas the original fragment returns a specific value based on the trigonometric functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sin function in the Complex class is a new function that is different from the Math.sin function, and using it instead of the original function would return different results.

DONE.
