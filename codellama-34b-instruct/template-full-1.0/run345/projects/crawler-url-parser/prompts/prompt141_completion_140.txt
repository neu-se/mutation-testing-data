  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the expression to 2, which would cause the different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the expression to 0, which would cause the different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`foo`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the expression from a number to a string, which would cause the different behavior.

DONE.
