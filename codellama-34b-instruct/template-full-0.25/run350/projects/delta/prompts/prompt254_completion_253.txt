  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first element of the iterator, regardless of the current position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the second element of the iterator, regardless of the current position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the third element of the iterator, regardless of the current position.

DONE.
