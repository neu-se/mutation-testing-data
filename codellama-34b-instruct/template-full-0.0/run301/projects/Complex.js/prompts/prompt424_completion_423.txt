  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of `isInfinite`, so a value that was previously considered infinite would now be considered finite, and vice versa.

DONE.
