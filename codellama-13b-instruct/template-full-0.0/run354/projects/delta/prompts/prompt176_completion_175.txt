  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return an empty delta, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return the first op in the delta, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return the last op in the delta, regardless of the input.

DONE.
