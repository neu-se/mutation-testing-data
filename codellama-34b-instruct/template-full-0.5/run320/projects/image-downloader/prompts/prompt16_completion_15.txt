  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while `options.dest.split('/').pop()` is an array of strings. This change would cause the code to fail because it is expecting a string, not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while `options.dest.split('/').shift()` is an array of strings. This change would cause the code to fail because it is expecting a string, not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').reverse().pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while `options.dest.split('/').reverse().pop()` is an array of strings. This change
