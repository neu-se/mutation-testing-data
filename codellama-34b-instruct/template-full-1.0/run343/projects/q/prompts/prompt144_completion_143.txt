  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty.writable
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_defineProperty.writable` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when called, whereas `object_defineProperty` is a function and would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty.unknownProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_defineProperty.unknownProperty` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when called, whereas `object_defineProperty` is a function and would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_defineProperty.bind(null)` is a bound function and would not have the same `this` value as `object_defineProperty`, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
