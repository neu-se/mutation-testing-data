  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then()` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function () { return reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then(function () { return reason; })` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with the value of `reason`, whereas `object` is a promise that resolves with the value of `reason`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function () { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then(function () { throw reason; })` is a function that returns a promise that rejects with the value of `reason`, whereas `object` is a promise that resolves with the value of `reason`.

DONE.
