  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = b[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]` instead of comparing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a[key]` is not equal to `b[key]` instead of checking if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] ||= b[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]` only if `a[key]` is falsy instead of always assigning it.

DONE.
