  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the argument, whereas `Math.sin` returns the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a => Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a => Math.sin(a)` is a function that takes a single argument `a` and returns the sine of `a`, whereas `Math.sin` is a function that takes a single argument and returns the sine of that argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => Math.sin` is a function that takes no arguments and returns the `Math.sin` function, whereas `Math.sin` is a function that takes a single argument and returns the sine of that argument.

DONE.
