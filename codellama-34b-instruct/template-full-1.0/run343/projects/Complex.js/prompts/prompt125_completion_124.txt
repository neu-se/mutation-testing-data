  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is less than 0, which is not the same as checking if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is greater than 0, which is not the same as checking if the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the dividend complex number is greater than 0, which is not the same as checking if the divisor complex number is infinite.

DONE.
