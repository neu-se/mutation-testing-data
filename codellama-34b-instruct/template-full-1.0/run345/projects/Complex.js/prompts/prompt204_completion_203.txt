  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + c` would add a constant to the original `b` variable, while the original code fragment `b` simply refers to the value of `b` without modifying it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` would multiply two values together, while the original code fragment `b` simply refers to the value of `b` without modifying it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - c
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - c` would subtract a constant from the original `b` variable, while the original code fragment `b` simply refers to the value of `b` without modifying it.

DONE.
