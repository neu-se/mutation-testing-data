 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty Delta object, instead of the second string argument passed to the diff function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference an undefined index in the strings array, causing an error and different behavior in the diff function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'some random string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the second string argument passed to the diff function with a random string, causing the diff function to behave differently.

DONE.
