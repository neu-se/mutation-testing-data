  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.name === "StopIteration"` checks if the exception's name is equal to "StopIteration".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception instanceof StopIteration` checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration` using the `instanceof` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.constructor === StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.constructor === StopIteration` checks if the exception's
