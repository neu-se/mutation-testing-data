Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ + 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 180 degrees to the angle, which would shift the calculated bearing by 180 degrees, leading to an incorrect direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the angle by 2, effectively doubling the bearing, which would result in an incorrect direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 90 degrees from the angle, which would rotate the bearing by 90 degrees counterclockwise, leading to an incorrect direction.

DONE.
