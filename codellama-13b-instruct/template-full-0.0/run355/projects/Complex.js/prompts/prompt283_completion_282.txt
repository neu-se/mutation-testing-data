  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is replaced with `sin`, which would cause the `cos` function to return the sine of the complex number instead of the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is replaced with `tan`, which would cause the `cos` function to return the tangent of the complex number instead of the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is replaced with `cosh`, which would cause the `cos` function to return the hyperbolic cosine of the complex number instead of the cosine.

DONE.
