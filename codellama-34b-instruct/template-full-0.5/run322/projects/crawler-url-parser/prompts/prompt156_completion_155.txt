  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string "foo" is not a valid regular expression and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string "bar" is not a valid regular expression and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "baz"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string "baz" is not a valid regular expression and would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
