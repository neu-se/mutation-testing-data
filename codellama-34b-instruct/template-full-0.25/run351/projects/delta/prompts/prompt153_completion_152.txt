  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the other iterator instead of the this iterator, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to only iterate over the this iterator when the next operation is an insert, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to only iterate over the other iterator when the next operation is an insert, potentially leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
