  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a / this['re'], b / this['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the reciprocal of `a` and `b`, while the modified code computes the ratio of `a` and `b` to the reciprocal of the magnitude of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a * this['re'], b * this['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the scalar product of `a` and `b`, while the modified code computes the dot product of `a` and `b` with the direction of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a - this['re'], b - this['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the vector difference between `a` and `b`, while the modified code computes the vector difference between `a
