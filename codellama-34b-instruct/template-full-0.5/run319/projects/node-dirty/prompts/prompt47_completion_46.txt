  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the callback function `cb` to the `set` method, which would then be called when the data is persisted. Replacing `cb` with `null` would cause the callback to be ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the caller of the `set` method relied on the callback being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the callback function `cb` to the `set` method, which would then be called when the data is persisted. Replacing `cb` with `undefined` would cause the callback to be ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the caller of the `set` method relied on the callback being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
