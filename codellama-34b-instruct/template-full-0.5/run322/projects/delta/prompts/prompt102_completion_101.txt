  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, while `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a method that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, while `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a method that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice(0, 1)` removes the first element of an array, while `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a method that is not defined in the code snippet.

DONE.
