  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which would return a different object than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.countries)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.countries` object as an argument, which would return a different object than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones.current)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones.current` object as an argument, which would return a different object than the original code fragment.

DONE.
