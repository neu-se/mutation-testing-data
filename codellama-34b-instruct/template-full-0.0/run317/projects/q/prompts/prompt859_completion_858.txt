  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, rather than rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw error` would throw the error object, rather than rejecting the promise with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Different error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(new Error("Different error message"))` would reject the promise with a different error message, rather than the original error object.

DONE.
