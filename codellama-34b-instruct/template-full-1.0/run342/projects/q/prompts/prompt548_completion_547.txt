  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ERROR"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string instead of an exception, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a null value instead of an exception, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an undefined value instead of an exception, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
