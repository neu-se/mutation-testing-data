  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is `undefined`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is `null`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is an empty string, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
