  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the argument is not an array. This change would cause the function to return a different value for arrays and non-arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` checks the length of the array, while `array.length === 0` checks if the length is equal to 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value for arrays with length 0 and non-arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.includes` checks if the array includes the specified value, while `array.includes(undefined)` checks if the array includes the value `undefined`. This change would cause the
