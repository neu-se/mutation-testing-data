  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property is not defined in the `currentUrl` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseurl` property is not defined in the `currentUrl` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not defined in the `currentUrl` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
