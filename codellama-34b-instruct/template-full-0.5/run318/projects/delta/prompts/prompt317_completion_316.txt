  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, while `op` is an object with an `insert` property that is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert.length` is a number, while `op` is an object with an `insert` property that is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert.charAt(0)` is a string, while `op` is an object with an `insert` property that is a string.

DONE.
