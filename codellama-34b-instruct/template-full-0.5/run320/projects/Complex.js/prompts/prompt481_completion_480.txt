  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite()` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isNaN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
