  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the `error` instead of resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the `error` instead of resolving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `closed` promise with the `error` instead of rejecting it.

DONE.
