  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is `undefined`. If `name` is `null` or an empty string, the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return the full object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.trim().length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is an empty string. If `name` is `null` or a string with only whitespace characters, the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return the full object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase().includes(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while
