  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key` is the key of the row, not the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the row, which could cause the test to fail if the value is not what was expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the row to `null`, which could cause the test to fail if the value is not what was expected.

DONE.
