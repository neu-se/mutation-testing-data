  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `places ^ 0` would always evaluate to 1, even if `places` is not a number, whereas `places || 0` would return the value of `places` if it is a number, or 0 otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `places * 0` would always evaluate to 0, even if `places` is not a number, whereas `places || 0` would return the value of `places` if it is a number, or 0 otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `-places || 0` would always evaluate to the negative value of `places`, even if `places` is not a number, whereas `places || 0` would
