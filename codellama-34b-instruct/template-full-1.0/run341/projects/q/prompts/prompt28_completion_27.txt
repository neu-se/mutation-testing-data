  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object that is not defined in the current scope, which would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that would be inserted as a variable, but it is not defined in the current scope, which would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that would be inserted as a variable, but it is not defined in the current scope, which would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
