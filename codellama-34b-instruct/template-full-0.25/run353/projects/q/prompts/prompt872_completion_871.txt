  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` would be a reference to the existing promise.

DONE.
