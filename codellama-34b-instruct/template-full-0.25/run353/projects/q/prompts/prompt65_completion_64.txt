  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Intentional error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called when the asynchronous task is complete, while the new code fragment `throw new Error("Intentional error")` would throw an error immediately, causing the task to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called when the asynchronous task is complete, while the new code fragment `return` would return immediately, causing the task to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Intentional log message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called when the asynchronous task is complete, while the new code fragment `console.log("Intentional log message")` would log a message to the console immediately, without affecting the task.

DONE.
