  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, which is the callback function that is passed to the `Q.nfapply` method. This would cause the `Q.nfapply` method to not receive the callback function as an argument, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, which is the `callback` function that is passed to the `Q.nfapply` method. This would cause the `Q.nfapply` method to not receive the `callback` function as an argument, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements of
