  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `ref[2]`, which is used as an argument to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `ref[2]`, which is used as an argument to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `ref[2]`, which is used as an argument to the `pull` function.

DONE.
