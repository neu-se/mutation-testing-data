This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes characters from the end of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This could cause the request to be sent to a different URL than intended, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

```
url.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` returns a substring starting from the second character of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This could cause the request to be sent to a different URL than intended, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` replaces all occurrences of the first argument with the second argument, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This could cause the request
