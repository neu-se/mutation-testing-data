  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[3]` instead of `ref[2]`. This change would cause the `switch` statement to fall through to the `default` case, which would result in a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[2] + 1` instead of `ref[2]`. This change would cause the `switch` statement to fall through to the `default` case, which would result in a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[2] * 2` instead of `ref[
