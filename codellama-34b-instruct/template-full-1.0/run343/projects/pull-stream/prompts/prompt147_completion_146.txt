  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values in the object, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `values.call(object)` calls the `values` function with `object` as the `this` value, which may not be the same as `this` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the object's prototype chain, while `Object.keys(object)` returns an array of the keys in the object.

DONE.
