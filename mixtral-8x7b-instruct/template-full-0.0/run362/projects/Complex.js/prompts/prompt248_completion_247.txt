 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a) - 1` calculates the exponential of a number and subtracts 1, while `Math.expm1(a)` calculates the exponential of a number minus 1 more accurately for small values of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E * Math.exp(a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.E * Math.exp(a) - 1` multiplies the exponential of a number by Euler's number (e) and subtracts 1, while `Math.expm1(a)` calculates the exponential of a number minus 1 more accurately for small values of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(Math.E, a) - 1
