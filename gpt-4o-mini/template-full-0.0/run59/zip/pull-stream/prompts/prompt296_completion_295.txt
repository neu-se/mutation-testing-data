Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || end
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to allow the function to proceed if either `ended` is true or `end` is true, which could lead to premature termination of the reading process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, allowing the function to continue if `ended` is false and `end` is true, which could cause it to ignore the termination condition when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === end
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality between `ended` and `end`, which could lead to unexpected results if `ended` is a truthy value and `end` is a falsy value, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly.

DONE.
