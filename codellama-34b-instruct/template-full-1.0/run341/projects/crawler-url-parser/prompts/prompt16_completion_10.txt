  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the query string and fragment from the URL, rather than just the fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character zero or more times, rather than match a fragment separator (#) followed by any character zero or more times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any URL that starts with a fragment separator (#), rather than just the fragment itself.

DONE.
