  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, which may cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.round` function returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer, which may cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random` function returns a random number between 0 and 1, which may cause the function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
