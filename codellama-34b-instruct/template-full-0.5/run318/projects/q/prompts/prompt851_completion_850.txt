  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, instead of rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the error object, instead of rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would reject the promise with a null value, instead of the error object.

DONE.
