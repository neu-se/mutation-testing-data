 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.bind(null, value).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method of the Array prototype with a null `this` value and the `value` as the first argument, followed by the `spread` method. This changes the context and could lead to different behavior in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(value).all.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `all` method instead of `spread`. The `all` method is used to create a promise that is fulfilled when all of the given promises are fulfilled, or rejects with the reason of the first promise to reject. Using this in place of `spread` would result in different behavior as it would not properly unwrap the array of values from the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(value).spread
