  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.hasOwnProperty('r') && a.hasOwnProperty('phi')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is present on the object itself, whereas the original code uses the `in` operator, which checks if the property is present on the object or its prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.r !== undefined && a.phi !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `r` and `phi` properties are not undefined, whereas the original code uses the `in` operator, which checks if the properties are present on the object or its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, 'r') && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, 'phi')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `
