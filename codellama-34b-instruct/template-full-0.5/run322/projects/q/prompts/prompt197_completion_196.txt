  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the portion of the stack trace after the "@" symbol, which may not include the desired information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second word of the stack trace, which may not be the desired information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the portion of the stack trace after the first colon, which may not include the desired information.

DONE.
