Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `a[key]` with itself instead of comparing it to `b[key]`, potentially leading to incorrect results when `a` and `b` have different values for the same key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the value of `a[key]` to be different from `undefined`, causing all keys in `a` to be included in the resulting attributes regardless of their actual values in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the case where `b[key]` is explicitly `null` as a difference, ignoring other potential values and leading to incorrect diff results when `b[key]` is any other falsy value (like `0` or `''`).

DONE.
