  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with three `null` arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with three `undefined` arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with three `false` arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
