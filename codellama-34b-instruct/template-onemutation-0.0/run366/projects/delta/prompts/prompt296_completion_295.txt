  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `indexOf` method to start searching for the newline character at the next position in the string, rather than starting from the current position. This could potentially cause the `eachLine` method to miss certain lines in the string, depending on the contents of the string and the position of the newline characters.
