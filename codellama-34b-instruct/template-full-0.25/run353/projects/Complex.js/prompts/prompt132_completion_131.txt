  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not being called with the correct argument. The method expects a complex number as its argument, but the placeholder is not a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is being called with the wrong argument. The method expects a complex number as its argument, but `z` is a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is being called with the wrong argument. The method expects a complex number as its argument, but `a` is a real number.

DONE.
