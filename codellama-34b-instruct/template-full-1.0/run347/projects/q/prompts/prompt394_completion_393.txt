  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `value` variable, while `null` would be a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `value` variable, while `void 0` would be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `value` directly, while `Promise.resolve(value)` would be a resolved promise with the value as its resolution value.

DONE.
