  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` is a function that takes two arguments, but in this case, only one argument is being passed, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument is being removed, which could cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(undefined, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is being passed as the first argument, which could cause the `drain` function to behave differently than if `null` were passed.

DONE.
