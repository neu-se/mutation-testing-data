  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, whereas `URL.format` returns a URL string. The `parse` method is typically used to extract information from a URL, while the `format` method is used to create a formatted URL string from a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.href` is a getter property that returns the entire URL string, including the protocol, host, and path. The `format` method only returns the path part of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.hostname` is a getter property that returns the hostname part of the URL, without the protocol or the port number. The `format` method returns the entire URL string, including the hostname, protocol, and port number (if specified).
