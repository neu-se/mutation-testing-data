  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter if it is falsy, while the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&` to provide a default value for `cb` if it is truthy. This change would cause the `sink.abort` function to behave differently if `cb` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter if it is falsy, while the new code fragment uses the logical NOT operator `!` to invert the value of `cb` and then uses the logical OR operator `||` to provide a default value for `cb` if it is falsy. This change would cause the `sink.abort` function to behave differently if `cb`
