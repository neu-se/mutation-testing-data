  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the method to return a new `Delta` object with the last `length` elements of the original `Delta` object removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the method to return a new `Delta` object with the last `length - 1` elements of the original `Delta` object removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the method
