  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts[0] = `/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, "\\$1")}`
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts` is an array and is being assigned to an element of the array, while the original code fragment adds an element to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.concat(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, "\\$1")}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is used instead of `push`, which would return a new array instead of modifying the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, "\\$1")}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is used instead of `push`, which would add an element to the beginning of the array instead of the end.

DONE.
