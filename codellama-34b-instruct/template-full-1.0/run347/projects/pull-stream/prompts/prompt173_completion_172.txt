  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.isArray` to check if `array` is an array, while the new code fragment uses `!Array.isArray` to check if `array` is not an array. This would cause the code to take the opposite branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.isArray` to check if `array` is an array, while the new code fragment checks if `array` has a length of zero. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.isArray` to check if `array
