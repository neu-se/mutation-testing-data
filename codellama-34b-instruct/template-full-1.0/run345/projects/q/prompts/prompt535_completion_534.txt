  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fulfilled function to receive the arguments as an array, rather than as individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.bind(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejected function to receive the arguments as an array, rather than as individual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[fulfilled, rejected]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the spread function to receive the fulfillment and rejection functions as an array, rather than as individual arguments.

DONE.
