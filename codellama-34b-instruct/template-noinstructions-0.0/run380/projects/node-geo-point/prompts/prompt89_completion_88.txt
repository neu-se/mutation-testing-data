  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the sine function, which is more appropriate for calculating the angular distance between two points on a sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the cosine function, which is more appropriate for calculating the angular distance between two points on a sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the arctangent function, which is more appropriate for calculating the angular distance between two points on a sphere.

DONE.
