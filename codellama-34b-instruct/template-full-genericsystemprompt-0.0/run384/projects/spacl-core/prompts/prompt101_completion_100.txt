  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `verb`, which would cause the `query` method to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `verb`, which would cause the `query` method to return a different result than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the value of `verb` to lowercase, which would cause the `query` method to return a different result than it should.

DONE.
