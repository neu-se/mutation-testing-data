  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + 1 / Math.sin(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has been replaced with `cos`, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + 1 / Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function has been replaced with `tan`, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + 1 / Math.atan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would
