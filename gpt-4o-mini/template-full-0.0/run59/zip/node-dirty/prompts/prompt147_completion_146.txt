Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const cb of cbs) cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with `null` as the error argument, which may lead to the assumption that the write operation was successful, even if it encountered an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const cb of cbs) cb('An error occurred');
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes a string error message to the callback, regardless of whether an actual error occurred, which could mislead the caller into thinking an error happened when it might not have.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const cb of cbs) cb();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback without any arguments, which means the caller will not receive any indication of success or failure, potentially leading to unhandled cases in the calling code.

DONE.
