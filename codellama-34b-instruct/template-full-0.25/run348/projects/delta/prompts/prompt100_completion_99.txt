  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `lastOp` is an object with a `retain` property that is a number, regardless of whether it has any attributes or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `lastOp` is an object with a `retain` property that is a number, regardless of whether it has any attributes or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `lastOp` is an object with a `retain` property that is a number and
