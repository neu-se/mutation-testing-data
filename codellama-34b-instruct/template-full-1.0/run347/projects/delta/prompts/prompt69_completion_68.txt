  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof length === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if `length` is a string, and the condition would never be met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if `length` is less than zero, and the condition would never be met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if `length` is greater than or equal to zero, and the condition would always be met.

DONE.
