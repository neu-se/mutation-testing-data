This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is not the same as the `baseUrlStr` argument that is passed to the function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr + baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is called with the concatenation of `currentUrlStr` and `base
