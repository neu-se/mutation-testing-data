  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an empty array instead of an array of the object's own enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an array containing a single element, `undefined`, instead of an array of the object's own enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an array containing a single element, an empty object, instead of an array of the object's own enumerable properties.

DONE.
