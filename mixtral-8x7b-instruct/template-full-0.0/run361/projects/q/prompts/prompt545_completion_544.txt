 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `verb` property of the generator object instead of calling the method with the given name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator['verb']
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the property named "verb" of the generator object instead of calling the method with the given name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verbs[verb]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the property of the generator object using a variable `verbs` which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
