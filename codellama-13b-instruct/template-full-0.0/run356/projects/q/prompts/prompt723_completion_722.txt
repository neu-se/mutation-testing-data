  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would be called on each element of the `promises` array, whereas the original code fragment `isPromise` would only be called on the first element. This could result in different behavior if the `isPromise` function has different behavior for different types of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would be called on each element of the `promises` array, whereas the original code fragment `isPromise` would only be called on the first element. This could result in different behavior if the `isPromise` function has different behavior for different types of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(promise) && promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise`
