  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `toString` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `toString` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have a `toString` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

DONE.
