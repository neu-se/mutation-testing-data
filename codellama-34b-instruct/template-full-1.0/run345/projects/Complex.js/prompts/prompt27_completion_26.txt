  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid input'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of error message that is thrown. Instead of indicating an invalid parameter, the new message would suggest that the input is invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Incoherent input'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of error message that is thrown. Instead of indicating an invalid parameter, the new message would suggest that the input is incoherent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Error parsing input'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of error message that is thrown. Instead of indicating an invalid parameter, the new message would suggest that there was an error parsing the input.

DONE.
