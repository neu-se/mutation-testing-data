  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is now 3 instead of 2, which would cause the string to alternate between "-" and "" more frequently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 1 is added to the string, which would cause the final result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + (minus % 2 ? '-' : '')
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional minus sign is added to the string, which would cause the final result to be different.

DONE.
