  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method returns the uppercase version of the string, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the length of the string, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.replace('a', 'b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of the first argument with the second argument, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
