  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not always present in the `options` object, and when it is not present, the `fs.readFileSync` method will use the default encoding, which may not be the same as the encoding specified in the `options` object.

DONE.
