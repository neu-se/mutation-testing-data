  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `a`, which takes the absolute value of the input, while `b - a` subtracts the input from `b`, which could result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `a`, which takes the absolute value of the input, while `a + 1` adds 1 to the input, which could result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `a`, which takes the absolute value of the input, while `a * Math.PI` multiplies the input by Pi, which could result in a different value.

DONE.
