  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the keys of the `a` object, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the keys of the `b` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a || b) {
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the keys of the `a` object if it is defined, otherwise it will iterate over the keys of the `b` object.

DONE.
