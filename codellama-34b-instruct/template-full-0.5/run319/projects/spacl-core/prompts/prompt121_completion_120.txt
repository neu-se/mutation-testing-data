  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `path` and `ctx` variables, whereas the original code fragment uses the `,` operator to separate them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path || ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return the first operand that is truthy, whereas the original code fragment uses the `,` operator to separate the operands.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path && ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return the first operand that is falsy, whereas the original code fragment uses the `,` operator to separate the operands.

DONE.
