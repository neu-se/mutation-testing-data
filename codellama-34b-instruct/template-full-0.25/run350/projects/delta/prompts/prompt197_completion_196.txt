  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` would be set to `otherOp.retain`, which is not the same as `newOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` would be set to `thisOp.retain`, which is not the same as `otherOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` would be set to `null`, which is not the same as `otherOp.retain` or `thisOp.retain`.

DONE.
