  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making the code inside the if block run when `hasStacks` is false, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks || typeof process === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition that checks if `process` is an object, which would make the code inside the if block run when `hasStacks` is false or `process` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks && typeof process === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition that checks if `process` is an object, which would make the code inside the if block run when `hasStacks` is true and `process` is an object.

DONE.
