 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(x).then(Q.join)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is used instead of `join`, which means that the promises will be resolved/rejected before being passed to `Q.join`. This could cause issues if the promises have different lengths or if they are not immediately resolvable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(x).join
