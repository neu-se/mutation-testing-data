  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word && rule[0].length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the rule is a string and if it matches the word, while this new code checks if the rule is a string and if it matches the word and has a length greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word && rule[0].toLowerCase() === word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the rule is a string and if it matches the word, while this new code checks if the rule is a string, if it matches the word, and if the rule is in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word && rule[0].split('').reverse().join('') === word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the rule
