  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object. This would cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` has a `delete` property, while this replacement checks if it does not have a `delete` property. This would cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` does not have a `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` has a `retain` property, while this replacement checks if it does not have a `retain` property. This would cause the code to behave differently when `
