  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is using the wrong capture group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is using the wrong capture group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is using the wrong capture group.

DONE.
