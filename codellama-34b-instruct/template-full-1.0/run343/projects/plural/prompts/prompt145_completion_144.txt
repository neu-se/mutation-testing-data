  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string representing the type of a variable or expression, while `type` is a function that returns a string representing the type of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.type.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.type.call(this)` would return the type of the object that the `plural` function is called on, while `type` returns the type of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` would refer to the first argument passed to the `plural` function, while `type` would return the type of a string.

DONE.
