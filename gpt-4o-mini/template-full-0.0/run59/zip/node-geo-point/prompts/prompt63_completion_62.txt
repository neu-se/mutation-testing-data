Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of the starting point instead of the calculated latitude of the destination point, leading to incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the calculated latitude of the destination point, which would skew the bearing calculation and produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines the latitudes of both points instead of using the calculated latitude of the destination point, resulting in an incorrect bearing calculation.

DONE.
