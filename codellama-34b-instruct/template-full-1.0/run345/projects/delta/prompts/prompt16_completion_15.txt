  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if an operand is of a certain type, whereas the `!==` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, `b !== undefined` would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is of any type other than `undefined`, even if its value is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b || b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which returns `true` if either operand is truthy. In this case, `!b` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is `null` or `undefined`, and `b === null` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(b).length` returns
