  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, which would cause the pluralization of words that should not be pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'g')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now global, which would cause the pluralization of all occurrences of the words, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'gi
