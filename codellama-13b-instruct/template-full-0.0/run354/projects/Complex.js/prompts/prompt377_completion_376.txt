  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function is used instead of the `sinh` function, which would cause the code to calculate the sine of the real part of the complex number instead of its hyperbolic sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function is used instead of the `cosh` function, which would cause the code to calculate the cosine of the real part of the complex number instead of its hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan` function is used instead of the `tanh` function, which would cause the code to calculate the tangent of the real part of the complex number instead of its hyperbolic tangent.

DONE.
