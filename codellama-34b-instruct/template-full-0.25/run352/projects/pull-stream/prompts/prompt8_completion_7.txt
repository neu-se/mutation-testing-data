  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks.map(function(sink) { return sink.name; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of sink names, whereas the original code fragment would return an array of sinks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks.filter(function(sink) { return sink.name === 'sink1'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of sinks with the name 'sink1', whereas the original code fragment would return an array of all sinks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks.reduce(function(acc, sink) { return acc + sink.name; }, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string containing the concatenated names of all sinks, whereas the original code fragment would return an array of sinks.

DONE.
