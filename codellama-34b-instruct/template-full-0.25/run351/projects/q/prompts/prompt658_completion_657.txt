  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
