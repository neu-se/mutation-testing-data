 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'content'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'content' would be used instead of the variable `content`, which could cause issues if the variable has a different value than the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1234
```
This would result in different behavior because an integer would be passed to `JSON.parse()` instead of a string, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the `stripBom()` function, potentially causing issues with the BOM (Byte Order Mark) in the file.

DONE.
