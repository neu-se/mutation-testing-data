  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is missing the parentheses, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the other iterator instead of the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the current iterator instead of the type.

DONE.
