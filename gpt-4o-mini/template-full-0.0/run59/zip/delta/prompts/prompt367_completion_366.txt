Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat all operations as deletes, potentially skipping over insert operations and leading to incorrect transformations of the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to incorrectly assume that the current operation is a retain, which could lead to incorrect handling of the Delta's operations and potentially result in data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert' && !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to only allow inserts when priority is false, which could lead to incorrect transformations when priority is true, potentially ignoring important operations that should be retained.

DONE.
