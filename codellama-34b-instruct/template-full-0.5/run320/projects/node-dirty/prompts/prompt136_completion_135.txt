  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value returned by `this._data.get(key)`, which would cause the written data to be different from the original data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) * 2}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value returned by `this._data.get(key)` by 2, which would cause the written data to be different from the original data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) - 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value returned by `this._data.get(key)`, which would cause the written data to be different from the original data.

DONE.
