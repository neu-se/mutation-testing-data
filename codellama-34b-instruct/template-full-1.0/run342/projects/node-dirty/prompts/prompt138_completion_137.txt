  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to 0, even if `this._data.get(key)` is not implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> || undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `undefined`, even if `this._data.get(key)` is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `null`, even if `this._data.get(key)` is implemented.

DONE.
