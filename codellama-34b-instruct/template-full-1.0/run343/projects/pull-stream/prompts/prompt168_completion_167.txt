  DONE.

Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a function that is expected to be called when the iteration is aborted. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to be called with `null` instead of `onAbort`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a function that is expected to be called when the iteration is aborted. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to be called with `undefined` instead of `onAbort`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a function that is expected to be called when the iteration is aborted. Replacing it with `() => {}`,
