  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the resulting value of `acc` to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the resulting value of `acc` to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the resulting value of `acc` to be different from the original.

DONE.
