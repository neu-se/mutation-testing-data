Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the original longitude value instead of the calculated longitude, which would lead to incorrect destination coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 360 degrees to the longitude, which could result in an incorrect longitude value that exceeds the valid range of -180 to +180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 180 degrees from the longitude, which would incorrectly shift the longitude value and potentially lead to an invalid geographical location.

DONE.
