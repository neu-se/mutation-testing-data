  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `null` as an argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `false` as an argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
