  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Q` function to create a new promise, but the replaced code creates a new function that does nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("intentional error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not throw an error, but the replaced code throws an error regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a promise that resolves immediately, but the replaced code creates a timer that never runs.

DONE.
