  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor.position
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cursor` object has a `position` property that is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor.selection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cursor` object has a `selection` property that is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor.range
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cursor` object has a `range` property that is not used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
