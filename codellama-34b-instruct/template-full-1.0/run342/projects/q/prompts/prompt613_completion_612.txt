  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different operation than "get", and would modify the object's property instead of reading it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a different operation than "get", and would remove the object's property instead of reading it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [key, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a different operation than "get", and would apply the object's property as a function and pass an empty array as arguments instead of reading it.

DONE.
