  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function is not called correctly. It expects a callback function as its second argument, but instead is being called with `cb` as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is not defined, so the `terminate` function will never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is not defined, so the `cb` function will not be called.

DONE.
