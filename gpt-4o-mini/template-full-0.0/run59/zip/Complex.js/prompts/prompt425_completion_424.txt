Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly indicate that the complex number is infinite regardless of its actual state, leading to incorrect results when calling the `inverse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the complex number as finite, even if it is actually infinite, thus returning a non-zero result instead of `Complex['ZERO']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the real part of the complex number to determine if it is infinite, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect handling of complex numbers that are infinite in the imaginary direction.

DONE.
