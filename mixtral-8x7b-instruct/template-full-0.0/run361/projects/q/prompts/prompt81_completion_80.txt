 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of running the `task` after all other tasks have been run, it would add an empty array to `nextTick.runAfter`'s argument list, causing unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `task` argument with the number 42, causing unexpected behavior when the task is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"alert('Mutation testing is fun!')"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `task` argument with a string that, when executed, would show an alert box instead of executing the intended task. This could expose a vulnerability if the code doesn't properly sanitize user input.

DONE.
