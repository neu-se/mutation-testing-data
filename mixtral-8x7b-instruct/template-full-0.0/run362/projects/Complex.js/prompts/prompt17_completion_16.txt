 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value of `b` is always replaced with 1, which may not accurately represent the original value in calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value of `x` is used instead of `b`, which may not provide the correct magnitude for the hypotenuse calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sum of `a` and `b` is used instead of their absolute values, which can lead to incorrect results in the hypotenuse calculation.

DONE.
