  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc + data` would perform addition instead of assignment, which could cause the `acc` variable to have an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc * data` would perform multiplication instead of assignment, which could cause the `acc` variable to have an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc = data + 1` would assign the value of `data + 1` to `acc`, which could cause the `acc` variable to have an unexpected value.

DONE.
