  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the `field` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the `field` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the number of elements in the `data` array, which could be different from the original value of `data`.

DONE.
