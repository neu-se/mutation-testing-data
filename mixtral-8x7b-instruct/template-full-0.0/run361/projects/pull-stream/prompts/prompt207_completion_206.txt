 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the callback to always return null as the error, even if an error occurred during the map function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the entire process, rather than just calling the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, function (err, data) { busy = false; cb(err, data); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `busy` to false before calling the callback, which could cause issues if the `map` function is asynchronous and takes some time to complete.

DONE.
