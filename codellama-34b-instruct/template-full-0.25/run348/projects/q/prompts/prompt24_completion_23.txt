  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only capture the first line of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only capture the lines of the stack trace after the first line, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only capture the lines of the stack trace before the last line, rather than the entire stack trace.

DONE.
