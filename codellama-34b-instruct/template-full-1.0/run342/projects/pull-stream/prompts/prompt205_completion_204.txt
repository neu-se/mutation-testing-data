  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass the `end` argument to the `cb` function, but the mutated code would pass `null` instead. This could cause the calling function to behave differently, for example if it is expecting an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass `end` as a parameter to the `cb` function, but the mutated code would pass `undefined` instead. This could cause the calling function to behave differently, for example if it is expecting a specific object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('intentional error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass a `null` value as the first argument to the `cb` function, but the mutated code would pass an error object. This could cause the calling function to behave differently, for example if it is expecting a specific error code.
