  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which could have unintended consequences in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise. Using `throw` instead of `reject` would cause an exception to be thrown instead of the promise being rejected, which could have unintended consequences in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a statement that returns a value from a function, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects
