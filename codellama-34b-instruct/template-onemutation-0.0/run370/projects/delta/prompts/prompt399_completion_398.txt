  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `thisData` and `otherData` are both objects, regardless of their contents. In the original code, the condition checks if both `thisData` and `otherData` are objects and not null, which is a more specific check.

DONE.
