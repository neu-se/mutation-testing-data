  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `undefined` would be included in the arguments passed to the `deliverTimezones` function, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `true` would be included in the arguments passed to the `deliverTimezones` function, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `-1` would be included in the arguments passed to the `deliverTimezones` function, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
