  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not an insert, while this replacement checks if it is an insert. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation has a non-zero length, while this replacement checks if the length of the next operation is greater than zero. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is not a delete, while this replacement checks if it is not a delete or an insert. This would cause the code to take a different
