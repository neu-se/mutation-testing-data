  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the argument to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds it to the end. This could cause the arguments to be applied to the callback in the wrong order, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This could cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 0, deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds the element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds it to the end. This could cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
