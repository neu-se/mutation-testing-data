  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as both arguments, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed as the first argument and `data` was passed as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `data` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, which is different from the original code where `null` was passed as the first argument and `data` was passed as the second argument.

DONE.
