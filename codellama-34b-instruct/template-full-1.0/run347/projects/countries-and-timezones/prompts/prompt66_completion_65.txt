  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object, and `options[0]` would return the first element of the object, which in this case is the country ID. However, the original code fragment `options` is an object that contains information about the country, and the function expects to receive this object as argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ABC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects to receive a valid country ID as argument, but providing a string "ABC" would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects to receive an object as argument, but providing an empty array would result in an error.

DONE.
