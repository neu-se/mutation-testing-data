  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (thisIter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `while (thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext())`, which results in a different iteration pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `const length = Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());`, which results in a different length calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.delete) {
  // Our delete either makes their delete redundant or removes their retain
  continue;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `if (thisOp.delete) {
  // Our delete either makes their delete redundant or removes their retain
  throw new Error
