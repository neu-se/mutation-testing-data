  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index is different, causing the return value to be the first capture group of the regex rather than the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index is different, causing the return value to be the third capture group of the regex rather than the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[5]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index is different, causing the return value to be the fifth capture group of the regex rather than the second.

DONE.
