  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||` operator, which returns the first operand if it is truthy, and the second operand otherwise. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the `&&` operator, which returns the second operand if the first operand is truthy, and `null` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||` operator, which returns the first operand if it is truthy, and the second operand otherwise. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the `||` operator, which returns the second operand if the first operand is falsy, and the first operand otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions ? {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||
