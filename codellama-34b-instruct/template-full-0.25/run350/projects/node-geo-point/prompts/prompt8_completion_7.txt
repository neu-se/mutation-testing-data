  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of `Object.prototype`, and using `call` or `apply` to invoke it on a different object would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.bind(point)('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context, and calling that function would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a different function than `point.hasOwnProperty`, and calling it on a different object would return a different value.

DONE.
