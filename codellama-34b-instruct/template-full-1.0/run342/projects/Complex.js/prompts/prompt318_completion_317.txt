  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number's real part (a) is used instead of the imaginary part (b).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part (b) is multiplied by 2, which would change the calculation of the cotangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the difference between the real and imaginary parts is used, which would change the calculation of the cotangent.

DONE.
