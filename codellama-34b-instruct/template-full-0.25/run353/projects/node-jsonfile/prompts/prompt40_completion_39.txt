  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. The former takes a callback function as its first argument, while the latter takes a promise as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromStream` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. The former takes a stream as its first argument, while the latter takes a promise as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromAsync` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. The former takes an asynchronous function as its first argument, while the latter takes a promise as its first argument.

DONE.
