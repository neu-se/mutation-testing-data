  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function produces an unexpected output value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function produces an unexpected data type. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1984
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function does not capture the current line number in the current file.
