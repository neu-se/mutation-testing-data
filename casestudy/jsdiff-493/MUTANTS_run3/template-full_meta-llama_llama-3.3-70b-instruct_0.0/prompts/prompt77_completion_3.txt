Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of checking if the object has the property with the name stored in the `key` variable, it checks if the object has a property with the name stored in the value of the property with the name stored in the `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always checks if the object has a property named 'key', rather than checking for the property with the name stored in the `key` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sortedKeys[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has a property with the name stored in the `sortedKeys` array at the current index, rather than checking for the property with the name stored in the `key` variable.

DONE.
