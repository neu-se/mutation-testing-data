 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would always call the callback with an error, even if `abort` is not passed or is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would stop iterating over the array elements prematurely, calling the callback with `true` even if there are more elements to process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would iterate past the last element of the array, potentially causing an `indexOutOfBounds` error or unexpected behavior if the array elements have side effects.

DONE.
