  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string on `/`, but then only keep the last two elements of the resulting array, rather than the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string on `/`, keep the last element of the resulting array, and then join the resulting array elements back together into a single string, rather than returning an array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(part => part.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string on `/`, keep the last element of the resulting array, and then replace all alphanumeric characters and underscores in the resulting string with empty strings
