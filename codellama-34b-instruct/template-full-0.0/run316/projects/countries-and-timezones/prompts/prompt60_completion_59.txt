  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially return a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially return a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially return a different country object.

DONE.
