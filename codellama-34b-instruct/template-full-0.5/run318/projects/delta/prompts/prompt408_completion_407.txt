  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.chop` is a method that removes the first element of an array, whereas `delta.chop(1)` would remove the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.chop(0)` would remove the first element of an array, whereas `delta.chop` would remove the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.chop(-1)` would remove the last element of an array, whereas `delta.chop` would remove the first element.

DONE.
