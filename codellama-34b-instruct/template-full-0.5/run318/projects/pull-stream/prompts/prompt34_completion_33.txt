  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `pull` function would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument of the `pull` function would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull` function would be called with a `null` value as the first argument, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
