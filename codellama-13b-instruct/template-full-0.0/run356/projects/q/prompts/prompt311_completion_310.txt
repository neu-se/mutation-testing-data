This would result in different behavior because the `race` method is called on the `Q` object, which is not the same as the `race` method called on the `Promise` object. The `race` method on the `Q` object takes an array of promises as an argument, while the `race` method on the `Promise` object takes no arguments.

```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called on
