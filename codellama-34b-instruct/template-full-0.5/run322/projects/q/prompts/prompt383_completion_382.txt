  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would be a rejected promise, causing the `then` method to reject with the rejection reason, rather than calling the fulfilled callback with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would be a fulfilled promise with a value of `undefined`, causing the `then` method to call the fulfilled callback with `undefined`, rather than rejecting with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(0)` would be a fulfilled promise with a value of `0`, causing the `then` method to call the fulfilled callback with `0`, rather than rejecting with the rejection reason.

DONE.
