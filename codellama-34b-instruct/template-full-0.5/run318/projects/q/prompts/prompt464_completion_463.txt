  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return -1, indicating that the promise is not in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, even if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return -1, indicating that the promise is not in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, even if it is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return 0, indicating that the promise is in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, even if it is not.

DONE.
