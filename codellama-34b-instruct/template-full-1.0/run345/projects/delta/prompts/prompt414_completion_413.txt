  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the positive length of the operation, while this replacement uses the negative length. This change would flip the direction of the operation, potentially causing the transformPosition method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates the offset by the length of the operation, while this replacement updates the offset by twice the length of the operation. This change would cause the transformPosition method to produce incorrect results, as the offset would be incremented by too much.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates the offset by the length of the operation, while this replacement resets the offset to zero. This change would cause the transformPosition method to produce incorrect results, as the offset would be reset to zero too frequently.

Done.
