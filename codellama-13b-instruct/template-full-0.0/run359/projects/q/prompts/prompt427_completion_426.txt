  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if an object has a `then` method, which is a common indicator of a promise-like object, whereas `isPromise` checks if an object is an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` checks if a promise is in the pending state, whereas `isPromise` checks if an object is an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if a promise is in the fulfilled state, whereas `isPromise` checks if an object is an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
