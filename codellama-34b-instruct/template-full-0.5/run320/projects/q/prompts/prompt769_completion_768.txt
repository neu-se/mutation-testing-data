  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any()
```
This would result in different behavior because `any()` returns the first resolved promise of an array, whereas `allResolved()` waits for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled()` waits for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected, whereas `allResolved()` only waits for all promises to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `all()` waits for all promises to be fulfilled, whereas `allResolved()` waits for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
