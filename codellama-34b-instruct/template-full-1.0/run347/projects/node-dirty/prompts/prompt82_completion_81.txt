  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === -1
+ chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === -1` checks if the last occurrence of `\n` is at the end of the chunk, while `chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === 0` checks if the last occurrence of `\n` is at the beginning of the chunk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === -1
+ chunk.indexOf('\n') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === -1` checks if the last occurrence of `\n` is at the end of the chunk, while `chunk.indexOf('\n') === -1` checks if the first occurrence of `\n` is at the beginning of the chunk.
