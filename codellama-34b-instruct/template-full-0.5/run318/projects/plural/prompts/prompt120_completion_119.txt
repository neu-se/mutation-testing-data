  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment always adds the "es" suffix.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment always adds the "s" suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment always removes the last character of the word and adds the "es" suffix.

DONE.
