  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Buggy Name"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would be checking the policy with the name "Buggy Name", instead of the policy with the name specified in the `name` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "Buggy"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would be checking the policy with the name "Buggy", instead of the policy with the name specified in the `name` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would be checking the policy with the name `undefined`, instead of the policy with the name specified in the `name` parameter.

DONE.
