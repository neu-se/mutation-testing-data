  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is not defined in the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
