  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `aborted` variable to `true`, regardless of the value it had before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the Boolean value of `aborted`, so if `aborted` was `true`, it would be set to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `aborted` by 1, so if `aborted` had a value of 5, it would be set to 6.

DONE.
