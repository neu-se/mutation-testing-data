  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete a key that is not present in the map, which would not have any effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete a key that is not present in the map, which would not have any effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

DONE.
