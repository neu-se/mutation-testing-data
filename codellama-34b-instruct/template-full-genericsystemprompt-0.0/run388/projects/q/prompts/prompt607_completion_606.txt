  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` argument, and adding 1 to it would result in a different operation being performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` argument, and subtracting 1 from it would result in a different operation being performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` argument, and multiplying it by 2 would result in a different operation being performed.

DONE.
