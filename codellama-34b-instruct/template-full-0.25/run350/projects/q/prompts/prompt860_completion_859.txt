  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the new error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the new error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the new error message.

DONE.
