  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to ignore case, so that the regular expression would match "default.PDF" as well as "default.pdf".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match across multiple lines, so that the regular expression would match "default.PDF" even if it appears on a different line than the rest of the URL.
