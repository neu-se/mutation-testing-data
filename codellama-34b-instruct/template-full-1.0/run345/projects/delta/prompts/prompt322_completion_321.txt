  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.slice(null, null)` would return an empty array, while `base.slice()` would return a copy of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.splice(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.splice(0, 0)` would add a new element to the array at index 0, while `base.slice()` would not modify the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.concat([])` would concatenate an empty array with the original array, while `base.slice()` would return a shallow copy of the original array.

DONE.
