 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return progressed.apply(this, arguments); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the `progressed` function to be the same as the context of the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
progressed.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the `progressed` function to be `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `progressed` function with the `Math.max` function, which has a completely different purpose and behavior.

DONE.
