 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is an object, and when `apply` is called with `null` or `undefined` as the `this` value, it will be implicitly converted to the global object. In strict mode, it will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a truthy value, and when used as the `this` value in the `apply` method, it will be coerced to a string object. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `value` object does not have methods that can handle string objects as their `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because a boolean is a primitive value, and when used as the `this` value in the `apply` method, it will be wrapped in its corresponding object (Boolean).
