  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` returns a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise with a value of `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
