Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` does not pass an array of arguments as `apply` does; instead, it requires individual arguments, which could lead to incorrect behavior if `args` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].apply(this, args.slice(0, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first argument from the `args` array to the function, ignoring any additional arguments that may be necessary for the function to execute correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, but does not invoke the function immediately or pass any arguments, which changes the intended execution flow.

DONE.
