  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, and passing `true` as an argument would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `true`, instead of being resolved with the expected value of the `promises` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, and passing `false` as an argument would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `false`, instead of being resolved with the expected value of the `promises` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, and passing `null` as an argument would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, instead of being resolved with the expected value of the `prom
