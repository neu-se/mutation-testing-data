  Option A: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Δλ` + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would wrap around to the other side of the globe when the longitude difference is greater than 180 degrees. In the original code fragment, an error would be thrown if the bearing exceeded 180 degrees.

Option B: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Δλ` * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would double the angle of the bearing, which would result in an incorrect bearing value. In the original code fragment, error is thrown if the bearing is greater than 180 degrees.

Option C: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Δλ`/2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would halves the angel of the bearing, which would result in an incorrect bearing value. In the original caused, error is thrown if the bearing exceeds 180 degrees.

DONE.
