  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```thisIter.hasNext()```
This would result in different behavior because thisIter.hasNext() always returns true while otherIter.peekType() =="insert" returns false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```index += length```
This would result in different behavior because index += length always changes index value while otherIter.hasNext() =="insert" does not change index value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```thisIter.next(length)```
This would result in different behavior because thisIter.next(length) always changes length value while otherIter.hasNext() =="insert" does not change length value.
