  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exponential of the real part of the complex number without considering the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(2 * this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exponential of twice the real part of the complex number, which would be a different value from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * Math.exp(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number times e, which would be a different value from the original code.

DONE.
