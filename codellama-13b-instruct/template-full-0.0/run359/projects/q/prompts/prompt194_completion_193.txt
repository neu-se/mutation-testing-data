  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["a", <line number>]` instead of `["filename", <line number>]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"b"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["b", <line number>]` instead of `["filename", <line number>]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"c"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["c", <line number>]` instead of `["filename", <line number>]`.

DONE.
