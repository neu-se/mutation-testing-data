  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of the original string, while `w.substr` returns a new string with the specified number of characters from the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` returns a new string with the specified number of characters from the original string, while `w.substr` returns a new string with the specified number of characters from the original string, starting from the specified position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr(1)` would return a new string with the specified number of characters from the original string, starting from the second character, while `w.substr` returns a new string with the specified number of characters from the original string, starting from the specified position.

DONE.
