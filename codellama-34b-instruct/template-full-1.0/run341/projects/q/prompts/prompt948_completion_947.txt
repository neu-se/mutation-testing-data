  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            callback.apply(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `this` instead of `thisp` to the `callback` function, which could cause unexpected behavior if the function relies on `this` to refer to a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            callback.call(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `arguments` as an array instead of as a separate variable, which could cause the `callback` function to receive a different `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `nodeArgs` instead of `arguments` to the `callback` function, which could cause the `callback` function to receive different arguments.

DONE.
