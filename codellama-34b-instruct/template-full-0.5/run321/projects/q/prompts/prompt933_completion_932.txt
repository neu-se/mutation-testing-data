  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that returns `undefined`, whereas `args` is a variable that may or may not be defined in the context of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid expression that returns `null`, whereas `args` is a variable that may or may not be defined in the context of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid expression that returns `undefined`, whereas `args` is a variable that may or may not be defined in the context of the function.

DONE.
