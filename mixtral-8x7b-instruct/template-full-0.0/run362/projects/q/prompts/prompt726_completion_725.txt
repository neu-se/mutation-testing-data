 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would not be called on the promise, and the state would not be checked. This could cause issues if the promise is still pending, leading to different behavior in the `all` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called on an empty object instead of the promise. This would cause the `state` property to be undefined, leading to different behavior in the `all` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly access the `state` property of the object returned by `inspect`, bypassing the check for the string value "fulfilled". This could cause issues if the promise is still pending or has a different state, leading to different behavior in the `all` function.
