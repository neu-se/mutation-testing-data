  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of the cosine hyperbolic function would result in a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine function would result in a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine hyperbolic function would result in a different output for the same input.

DONE.
