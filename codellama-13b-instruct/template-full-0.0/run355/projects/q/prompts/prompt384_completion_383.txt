  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback.fcall(value)` expression would be evaluated before the `thenResolve` method is called, which would cause the callback to be called with the original value instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would be called with the original value instead of the resolved value, which would cause the callback to be called with the original value instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value).then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would be called with the original value instead of the resolved value, which would cause the callback to be called with the original value instead of
