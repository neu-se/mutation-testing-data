 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method of the returned promise would return an empty array instead of the keys of the `value` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method of the returned promise would return an array containing the string "length" and a numeric index instead of the keys of the `value` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
