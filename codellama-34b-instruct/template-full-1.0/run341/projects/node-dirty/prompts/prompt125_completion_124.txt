  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load_done');
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit('load_done')` would emit a different event than `this.emit('load', this._data.size)`, which could cause the program to behave differently in a way that would make it more difficult to detect bugs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1)` would emit a event with a different number than `this.emit('load', this._data.size)`, which could cause the program to behave differently in a way that would make it more difficult to detect bugs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1
