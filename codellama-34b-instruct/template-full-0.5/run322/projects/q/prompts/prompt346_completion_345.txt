  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object instead of using the existing one, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the exception object instead of rejecting it, which could cause the test to pass when it should fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an exception instead of returning a rejected promise, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
