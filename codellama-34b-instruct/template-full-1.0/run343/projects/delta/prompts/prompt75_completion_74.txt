  Sure! Here are three potential options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments, along with brief explanations of how the behavior would differ:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nul
```
This would result in different behavior because `nul` is a null pointer, whereas `cloneDeep` is a function that returns a deep copy of an object. If the code were to use `nul` in place of `cloneDeep`, it would result in a null reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
func
```
This would result in different behavior because `func` is a function that takes no arguments and returns no value, whereas `cloneDeep` is a function that returns a deep copy of an object. If the code were to use `func` in place of `cloneDeep`, it would always return the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a) => a
```
This would result in different behavior because `(a) => a
