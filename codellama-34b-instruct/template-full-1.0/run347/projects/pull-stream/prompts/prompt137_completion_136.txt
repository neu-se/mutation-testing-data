  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `cb(end)` instead of `cb(null, generate())` when `end` is not null, which would alter the function's output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `cb(end)` instead of `cb(null, generate())` when `end` is negative, which would alter the function's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `cb(end)` instead of `cb(null, generate())` when `end` is NaN, which would alter the function's output.

DONE.
