 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zipArchive.glob()` method would be called unconditionally, even for non-glob `src` values. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when processing non-glob `src` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src.match(/\*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `src` string contains an asterisk character (`*`), which is a common wildcard character used in glob patterns. However, this is not equivalent to the original `isGlob()` function, which checks if the `src` value is a valid glob pattern. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when processing non-glob `src` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src.includes('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `src` string contains a period character (`.`).
