  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called with the rejection reason.

DONE.
