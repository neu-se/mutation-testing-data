  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `end` is not strictly equal to `true`, whereas the original code fragment would return `end` if it is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `end` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would return `end` if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `end` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would return `end` if it is truthy.

DONE.
