  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$|ious$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the word "ious" in addition to "ics", which would cause the pluralization to always return the original word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the pluralization function is now returning "ices" instead of "ics" for words ending in "ics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the pluralization function is now returning "is" instead of "ics" for words ending in "ics".

DONE.
