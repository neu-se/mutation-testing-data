  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` will call the `nextStream` function immediately, while `nextChunk` will be passed as an argument to the `read` function and executed later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(null, data)` will call the `cb` function immediately with the data from the current stream, while `nextChunk()` will call the `nextChunk` function later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, nextStream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(null, nextStream)` will pass the `nextStream` function as an argument to the `read` function and execute it later, while `nextChunk()` will call the `nextChunk` function immediately.

DONE.
