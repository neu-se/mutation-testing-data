  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause an error when the `cb` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if `end` is `null`.

DONE.
