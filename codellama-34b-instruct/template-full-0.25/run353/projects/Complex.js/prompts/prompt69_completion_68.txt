  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this replacement code fragment returns a special value `Complex['INFINITY']` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this replacement code fragment returns a special value `Complex['NAN']` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['PI'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this replacement code fragment returns a special value `Complex['PI']` instead.

DONE.
