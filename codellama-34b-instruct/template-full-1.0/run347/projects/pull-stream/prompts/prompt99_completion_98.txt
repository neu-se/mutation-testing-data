  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err === true` checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`. In this new version, `err ? null : true` checks if `err` is truthy, which means it would be considered true even if it's not exactly equal to `true`. So if `err` is a truthy value that is not strictly equal to `true`, the original code would have returned `err`, while this new version would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err === true` checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`. In this new version, `err !== true ? null : err` checks if `err` is not strictly equal to `true`, and if it is, it returns `err`. So if `err` is any value other than `true`, the original code would have returned `null
