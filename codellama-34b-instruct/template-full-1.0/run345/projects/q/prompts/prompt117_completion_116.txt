  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to map the `callback` function to a new array of strings, rather than an array of values from the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to map the `callback` function to a new array of numbers, rather than an array of values from the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to map the `callback` function to an array of `undefined` values, rather than an array of values from the original array.

DONE.
