  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would pass the `end` argument as `true` or `false`, depending on the value of the `ended` variable. However, the new code fragment `read(false, cb)` would always pass `false` as the `end` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would pass the `end` argument as `true` or `false`, depending on the value of the `ended` variable. However, the new code fragment `read(null, cb)` would always pass `null` as the `end` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.
