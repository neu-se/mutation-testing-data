  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `newException` object is being accessed instead of the `newException` object itself. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `newException` object is being accessed instead of the `newException` object itself. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected with a different error stack trace than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of the `newException` object is being accessed instead of the `newException` object itself. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected with a different error name than the original code.

DONE.
