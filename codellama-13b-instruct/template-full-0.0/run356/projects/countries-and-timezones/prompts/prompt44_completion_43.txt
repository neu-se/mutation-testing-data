  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function is called with the `id` and `options` parameters, which would cause the function to return a different country object than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function is called with only the `id` parameter, which would cause the function to return a different country object than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function is called with the `id` and an empty options object, which would cause the function to return a different country object than the original code.

DONE.
