  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 1 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator using `%` used in the original code was incorrect. The correct operator is `% 2` instead of `% 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator using `%` used in the original code was incorrect. The correct operator is `% 2` instead of `% 1`, and the addition sign was used incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator using `%` used in the original code was incorrect. The correct operator is `% 2` instead of `% 1`, and the operand was incorrect.

DONE.
