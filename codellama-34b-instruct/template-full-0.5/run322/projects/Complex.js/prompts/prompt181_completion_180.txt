  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is true when the number is infinite, while `isZero` is true when the number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is the imaginary part of the complex number, and `1` is a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is the real part of the complex number, and `0` is a real number.

DONE.
