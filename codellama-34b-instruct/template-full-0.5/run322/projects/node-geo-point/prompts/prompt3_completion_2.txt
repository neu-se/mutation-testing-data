  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the longitude is less than -180 or greater than 180, while this new code fragment checks if the longitude is less than or equal to -180 or greater than or equal to 180. This would cause the code to allow for more values of longitude to be considered valid, which could potentially lead to errors in the code's calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude != -180 || longitude != 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the longitude is less than -180 or greater than 180, while this new code fragment checks if the longitude is not equal to -180 or not equal to 180. This would cause the code to allow for more values of longitude to be considered valid, which could potentially lead to errors in the code's calculations.
