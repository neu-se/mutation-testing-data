  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        stackLine[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the stack line instead of the entire line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        stackLine.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire stack line except for the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        stackLine.split(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack line into an array of strings using the colon character as a delimiter, instead of returning the entire line as a string.

DONE.
