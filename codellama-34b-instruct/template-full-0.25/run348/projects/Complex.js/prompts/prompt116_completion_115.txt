  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the first argument, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the second argument plus one, regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the sum of the two arguments, regardless of their values.

DONE.
