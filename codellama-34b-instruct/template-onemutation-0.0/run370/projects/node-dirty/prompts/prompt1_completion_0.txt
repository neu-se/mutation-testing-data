  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `_load` method, which loads the data from the file system, while the new code fragment overrides the `_load` method with an empty function, which does not load any data.

DONE.
