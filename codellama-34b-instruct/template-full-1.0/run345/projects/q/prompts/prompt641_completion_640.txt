  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of posting the object and argument, it would attempt to put the object and argument, which is an invalid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"push"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of posting the object and argument, it would attempt to push the object and argument, which is an invalid operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of posting the object and argument, it would attempt to send the object and argument, which is an invalid operation.

DONE.
