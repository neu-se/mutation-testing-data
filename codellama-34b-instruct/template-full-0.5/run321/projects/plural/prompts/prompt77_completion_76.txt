  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "dice" as the plural form of the word "die", while the new code fragment uses the word "dies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "dice" as the plural form of the word "die", while the new code fragment uses the word "die" as the plural form of the word "die".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dicey'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "dice" as the plural form of the word "die", while the new code fragment uses the word "dicey" as the plural form of the word "die".

DONE.
