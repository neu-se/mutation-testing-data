  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which would cause the code to always evaluate to `true` when checking if the `point.coordinates` property is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` returns `true` if the given value is an integer, but `point.coordinates` is an array of numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` returns `false` if the given value is not an array, which would cause the code to always evaluate to `false` when checking if the `point.coordinates` property is an array.

DONE.
