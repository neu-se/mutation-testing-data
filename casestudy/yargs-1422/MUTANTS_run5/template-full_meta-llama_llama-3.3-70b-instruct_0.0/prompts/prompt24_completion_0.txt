Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
middleware.applyBeforeValidation === beforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to skip applying the middleware from "when applyBeforeValidation does not match" to "when applyBeforeValidation matches", effectively inverting the logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
middleware.applyBeforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the comparison with `beforeValidation` and instead depends solely on the value of `middleware.applyBeforeValidation` being truthy or falsy, potentially allowing more middlewares to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!beforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely disregards the `middleware.applyBeforeValidation` property and instead only considers the `beforeValidation` parameter, potentially leading to middlewares being skipped or applied incorrectly based on this single factor.

DONE.
