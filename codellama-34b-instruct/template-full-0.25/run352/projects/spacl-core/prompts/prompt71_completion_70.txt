  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for exact match of the verb, while the replaced code fragment is checking for case-insensitive match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for exact match of the verb, while the replaced code fragment is checking for reverse match of the verb.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.replace('verb', 'noun')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for exact match of the verb, while the replaced code fragment is checking for match of the noun.

DONE.
