  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event would be emitted anytime the _load method is called, even if there is no error, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event would be emitted anytime the _load method is called, with a value of 0, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'load' event would be emitted anytime the _load method is called, with a value of 1, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
