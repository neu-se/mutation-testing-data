  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `priority`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `priority`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of `priority`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

DONE.
