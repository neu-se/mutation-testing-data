  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.makePromise` function expects to receive a promise as its second argument, but the modified code would pass in the `promise` object instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would pass in the `reject` function as the first argument to `self.promiseDispatch`, but the original code passes in the `fulfilled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would pass in the `deferred` object as the second argument to `Q.makePromise`, but the original code passes in the `rejected` function.

DONE.
