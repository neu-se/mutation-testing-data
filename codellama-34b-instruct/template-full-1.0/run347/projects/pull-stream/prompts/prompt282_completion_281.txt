  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the boolean negation operator, which would return `false` if `data` is truthy and `true` otherwise. In contrast, the original code fragment `data` would simply return the value of `data` without any modification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `data + 1` would return the sum of `data` and `1`, whereas the original code fragment `data` would simply return the value of `data` without any modification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that can't be compared using the `==` operator, which would throw an error. In contrast, the original code fragment `data` would have a reference comparison with `null`, which would return `false` if `data` is not null, and `true`
