  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment:
```
ended, cb
```
does not use the logical AND operator, but the new code fragment does. This means that the `cb` function will be executed even if the `ended` variable is not true, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment:
```
ended, cb
```
uses the logical AND operator, but the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator. This means that the `cb` function will be executed even if the `ended` variable is not true, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ^ cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment:
```
ended, cb
```
uses the logical AND operator, but the new code fragment uses
