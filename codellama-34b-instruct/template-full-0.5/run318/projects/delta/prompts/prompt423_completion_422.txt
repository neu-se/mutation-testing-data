  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be subtracted from the `index` variable, rather than the `offset` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `offset` variable to be subtracted from the `index` variable, rather than the `length` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be multiplied by the `index` variable, rather than being subtracted from it.

DONE.
