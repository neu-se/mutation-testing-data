  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(Boolean).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter(Boolean)` would remove any falsy values from the `values` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice(1).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array with all elements except the first one, which could potentially change the behavior of the `map` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reverse().map
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the `values` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `map` function.

DONE.
