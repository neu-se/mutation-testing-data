  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a specified number of milliseconds, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is a function that schedules a function to be executed before the next repaint, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that schedules a function to be executed repeatedly at a specified interval, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

DONE.
