  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve` method expects a URL object as its second argument, but `parsedUrl.pathname` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.path` is a string that represents the path of the URL, while `parsedUrl` is a URL object that contains the entire URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` is a string that represents the entire URL, while `parsedUrl` is a URL object that contains the URL components.

DONE.
