Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a boolean `true` to the `makeNodeResolver` function, which may alter the expected behavior of the resolver, potentially causing it to resolve or reject the promise incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `makeNodeResolver` function could lead to a situation where the callback is not properly invoked, resulting in the promise never resolving or rejecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` may cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to behave differently than expected, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections or incorrect callback handling.

DONE.
