  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the function to return a different value, which would affect the `type` property of the `currentUrl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the function to return a different value, which would affect the `type` property of the `currentUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the function to return a different value, which would affect the `type` property of the `currentUrl` object.

DONE.
