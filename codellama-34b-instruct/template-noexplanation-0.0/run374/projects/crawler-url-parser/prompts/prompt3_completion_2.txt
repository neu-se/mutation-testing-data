  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `===` operator instead of `typeof`. This can cause the code to behave differently if `currentUrlStr` is not a string, but it is still a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == null
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `==` operator instead of `typeof`. This can cause the code to behave differently if `currentUrlStr` is not a string, but it is still a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the length of `currentUrlStr` is 0, which can cause the code to behave differently if `currentUrlStr` is an empty string.

DONE.
