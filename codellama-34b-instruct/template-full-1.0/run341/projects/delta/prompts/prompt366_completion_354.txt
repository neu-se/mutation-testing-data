  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Hello, world!')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement is not related to the logic of the `Delta` class, and would cause the code to output a message to the console instead of performing the intended operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the `transformPosition` method to exit early, potentially resulting in a different return value than the original method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('This is a bug.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, potentially resulting in a different execution path than the original method.

DONE.
