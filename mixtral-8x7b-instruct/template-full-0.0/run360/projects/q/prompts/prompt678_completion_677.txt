 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces the possibility of invoking an unintended method from any object's prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).unknownMethod
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a non-existent method on the Q promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the `object` argument, which might not be handled correctly in the `Q.fcall` and `Q.fbind` methods.

DONE.
