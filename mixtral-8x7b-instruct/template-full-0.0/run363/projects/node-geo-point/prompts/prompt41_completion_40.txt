 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `sin(point1Rad)` calculation with the number 1, which would not change based on the input value of `point1Rad`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `sin(point1Rad)` calculation with the constant value of 1, which is the result of `sin(Math.PI / 2)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `sin(point1Rad)` calculation with the value of `point2Rad`, which is the longitude of the second point, instead of the latitude of the first point.

DONE.
