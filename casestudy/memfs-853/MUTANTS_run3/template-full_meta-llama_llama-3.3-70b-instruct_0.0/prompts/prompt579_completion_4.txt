Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message to include the path of the link instead of the filename, potentially providing more context about the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
steps.join(sep)
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the joined path steps in the error message instead of the filename, which could lead to different error messages depending on the path structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.root.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it always includes the path of the root directory in the error message, regardless of the filename or link being opened, potentially obscuring the actual source of the error.

DONE.
