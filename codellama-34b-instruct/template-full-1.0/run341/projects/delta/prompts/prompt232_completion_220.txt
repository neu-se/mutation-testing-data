  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because nextLength is a property of otherIter that is not a function, but in the original code, nextLength is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peepLength
```
This would result in different behavior because peepLength is not a function, but in the original code, peekLength is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because peekLength is a property that is constantly being updated by peekLength of otherIter, but in this replacement code, peekLength is a constant that is always 0.

DONE.
