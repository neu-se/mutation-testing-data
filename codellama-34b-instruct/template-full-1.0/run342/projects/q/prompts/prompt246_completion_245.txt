  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, meaning that if `Q.longStackSupport` was `true` and `hasStacks` was `true`, the boolean expression would be `false`, and if `Q.longStackSupport` was `false` or `hasStacks` was `false`, the boolean expression would be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check that `Q.longStackSupport` is `true`, but if `hasStacks` is `false`, the boolean expression would be `false`, even if `Q.longStackSupport` was `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition `false` to the end of
