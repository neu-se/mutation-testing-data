  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options + 'randomString'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to concatenate `options` with the string `'randomString'`, which would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options,
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra comma at the end of the function arguments would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, {...options, newProperty: 'newValue'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new object property `newProperty` would be added to the `options` object, which could potentially affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
