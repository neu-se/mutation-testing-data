  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the literal string `'Q(value)'` instead of the resolved value of the promise returned by `Q(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the progress listeners with the resolved value of the promise returned by `fulfill(value)` instead of the original value passed to `fulfill()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the literal string `'reject(reason)'` instead of the rejected value of the promise returned by `reject(reason)`.

DONE.
