  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the square root of the absolute value of `x`, which is not the same as the square root of `x` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x*x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `x`, whereas this version uses the absolute value of `x` squared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the cosine of `x`, whereas this version uses the sine of `x`.

DONE.
