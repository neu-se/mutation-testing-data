Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(app.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the specific file name that the stack trace is checking for, potentially allowing internal frames from a different file to be considered as non-internal, which could lead to incorrect stack trace filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node):"
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the string to check for a more generic node reference, which may match more stack lines than intended, thus incorrectly identifying internal frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(server.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies a different file name, which could cause the filtering logic to miss internal frames that should be excluded, leading to a cluttered stack trace with irrelevant information.

DONE.
