  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a function that returns a handler object for the given operation, and `otherOp.retain` is a property that contains the retain operation for the other delta. Using this code fragment would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with the retain operation as an argument, which would return a different handler object than the one returned by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a function that returns a handler object for the given operation, and `otherOp.attributes` is a property that contains the attributes for the other delta. Using this code fragment would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with the attributes as an argument, which would return a different handler object than the one returned by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
