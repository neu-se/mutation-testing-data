  Option 1:
```
+self[TMP] + index;
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the `index` variable, instead of evaluating the callback function.

Option 2:
```
callback.apply(thisp, (value, index, self));
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the parameters to `apply` as an array, instead of as separate arguments.

Option 3:
```
callback(self[index]]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `self` array as the first argument, instead of the `value` variable.

DONE.
