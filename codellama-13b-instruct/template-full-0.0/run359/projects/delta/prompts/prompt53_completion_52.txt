  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.compose(a, b, keepNull)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method of the `EmbedHandler` interface is called with the `a` and `b` parameters, which may cause the `transform` method to be called with different parameters than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method of the `EmbedHandler` interface is called with the `a` and `b` parameters, which may cause the `transform` method to be called with different parameters than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(a, b, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method of the `EmbedHandler` interface is called with the `a`, `b`, and `priority` parameters, which may cause the `compose` or `in
