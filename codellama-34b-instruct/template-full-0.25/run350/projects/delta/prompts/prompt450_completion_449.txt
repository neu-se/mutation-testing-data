  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both numbers and objects, while this new code only checks for strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both numbers and objects, while this new code only checks for null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain.constructor === Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both numbers and objects, while this new code only checks for arrays.

DONE.
