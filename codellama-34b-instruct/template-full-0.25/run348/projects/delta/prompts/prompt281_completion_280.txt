  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation or produce an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract an extra character from the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation or produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation or produce an incorrect result.

DONE.
