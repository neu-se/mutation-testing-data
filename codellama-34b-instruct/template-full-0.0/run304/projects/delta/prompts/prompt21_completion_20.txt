  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the values are not equal, even if they are both `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && a[key] !== null && b[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the values are not equal and both values are not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== null && b[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the values are not equal and both values are not `null`, using the `isEqual` function from the `lodash` library.

DONE.
