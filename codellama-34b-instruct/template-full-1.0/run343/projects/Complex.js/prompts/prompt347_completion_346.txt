  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function is being multiplied by the variable `a` before it is called, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)+Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function is being called twice, once with the `a` argument and once with the `b` argument, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function is being replaced with the `Math.cos` function, which has a different output for the same input values.

DONE.
