  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is an object, and `attr` is a property of that object. In the original code, `attr` is being used as a key in the `baseInverted` object, which is not possible if `attr` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseInverted
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseInverted` is an object, and `attr` is a property of that object. In the original code, `attr` is being used as a key in the `baseInverted` object, which is not possible if `attr` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[attr]
```
This would result in different behavior because `base[attr]` is a property of the `base` object, and `attr` is a property of the `attr` object. In the original code, `attr` is being used as
