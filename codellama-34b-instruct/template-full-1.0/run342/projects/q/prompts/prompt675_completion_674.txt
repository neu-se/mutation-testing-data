  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a function that invokes a method on an object, whereas "apply" is a function that invokes a function with a specific **this** value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a function that creates a new function with a specific **this** value and arguments, whereas "apply" is a function that invokes a function with a specific **this** value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"map"
```
This would result in different behavior because "map" is a function that creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the original array, whereas "apply" is a function that invokes a function with a specific **this** value and arguments provided as an array.

DONE.
