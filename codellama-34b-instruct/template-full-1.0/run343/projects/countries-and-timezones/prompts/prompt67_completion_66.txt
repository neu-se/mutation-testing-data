  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id + 1], options
```
This would result in different behavior because the country with the next ID after the one provided is returned, rather than the country with the specified ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id * 2], options
```
This would result in different behavior because the country with twice the ID of the one provided is returned, rather than the country with the specified ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id - 1], options
```
This would result in different behavior because the country with the previous ID before the one provided is returned, rather than the country with the specified ID.

DONE.
