  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `object` variable, while the new code fragment returns the value of the `foo` property of the `object` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `object` variable, while the new code fragment returns the value of the `bar` property of the `object` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `object` variable, while the new code fragment returns the value of the `baz` property of the `object` variable.

DONE.
