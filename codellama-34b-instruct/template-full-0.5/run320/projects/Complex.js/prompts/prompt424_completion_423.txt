  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `isInfinite` method, so that if the original code would have returned `true`, the mutated code would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if a number is finite, while the `isInfinite` method checks if a number is infinite. So, if the original code would have returned `true` because the number is infinite, the mutated code would return `false` because the number is not finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if a number is not a number, while the `isInfinite` method checks if a number is infinite. So, if the original code
