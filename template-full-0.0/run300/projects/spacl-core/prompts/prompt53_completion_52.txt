  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `/` at the end of the regex would cause the match to fail, as it would require an additional `/` at the end of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/g'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the match to be global, meaning that it would match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the match to be case-insensitive, meaning that it would match both uppercase and lowercase letters in the input string.

DONE.
