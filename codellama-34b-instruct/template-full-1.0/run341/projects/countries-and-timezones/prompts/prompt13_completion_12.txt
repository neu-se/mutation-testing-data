  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [1, 2], all: [3, 4] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `result[country].current` and `result[country].all` would be different than the original code. In the original code, `result[country].current` and `result[country].all` were initialized as empty arrays, but in this modified code, they are assigned the arrays `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]`, respectively. This change could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return different results, depending on how it uses the `timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [1, 2], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `result[country].all` would be different than the original code. In the original code, `result[country].all` was initialized as an empty array, but in this modified code
