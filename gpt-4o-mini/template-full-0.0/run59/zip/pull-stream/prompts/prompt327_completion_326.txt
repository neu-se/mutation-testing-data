Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called with `abort` set to `null`, which would change the handling of the `end` condition and potentially lead to incorrect termination behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the `once` function would not trigger the intended logic for aborting, leading to the `onEnd` callback being called with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `'error'` would cause the `once` function to treat it as a non-`true` value, which would alter the flow of the program and potentially lead to incorrect error handling.

DONE.
