  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.ok
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ses.ok` would negate the `ses.ok` variable, potentially causing the function to exit early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is not defined and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isNotOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isNotOk` is not defined and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
