  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of this['re'] instead of simply returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of this['im'] instead of this['re'].

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of this['re'] instead of simply returning it.

DONE.
