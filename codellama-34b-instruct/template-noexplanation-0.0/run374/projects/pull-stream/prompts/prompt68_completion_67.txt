  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This will cause the `console.error` function to be called instead of `console.warn`, which may have different behavior depending on the implementation of the `console` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This will cause the `console.log` function to be called instead of `console.warn`, which may have different behavior depending on the implementation of the `console` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This will cause the `console.info` function to be called instead of `console.warn`, which may have different behavior depending on the implementation of the `console` object.

DONE.
