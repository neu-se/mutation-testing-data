  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is already defined in the surrounding scope as the loop variable, and using it as the key would cause the loop to skip every other iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the property `'i'` of the `object` repeatedly, instead of iterating over the property corresponding to the value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = object[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[i]` is a function, and using it as a key would cause the loop to iterate over its properties, instead of over the values of the `object`.

DONE.
