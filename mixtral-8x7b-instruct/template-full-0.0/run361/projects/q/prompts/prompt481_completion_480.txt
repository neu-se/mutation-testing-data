 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array slice would receive an integer as the second argument, which would cause unexpected behavior. The original code fragment `<PLACEHOLDER>` is supposed to be replaced with the index of the unhandled reason being removed, but using the array's length would not correspond to the correct index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * unhandledReasons.length)

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method
