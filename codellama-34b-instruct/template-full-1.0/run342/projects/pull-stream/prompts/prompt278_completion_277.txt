  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper !== mapper` is always false, even if `mapper` is a function or an object with a `valueOf` method that returns a non-equal value. In the original code, `!mapper` would convert `mapper` to a boolean value, which might be different from the original `mapper` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.property
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper.property` would return the property of `mapper` with the name "property", while `!mapper` would return `true` if `
