  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would immediately reject the promise, whereas `Q` would forward the resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would immediately fulfill the promise, whereas `Q` would forward the resolution of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.notify()` would notify the listeners of the deferred object, whereas `Q` would forward the resolution of the promise.

DONE.
