  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `b` is a variable that may have a different value than `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `this.re` is a property of the `this` object that may have a different value than `a`.

DONE.
