  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the second argument instead of the third, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the third argument instead of the second, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the fourth argument instead of the second, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to be incorrect.

DONE.
