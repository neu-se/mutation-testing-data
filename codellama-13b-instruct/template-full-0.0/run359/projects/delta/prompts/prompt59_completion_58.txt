  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `ops` property of the `ops` object, which is not what the original code intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the first element of the `ops` array, which is not what the original code intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the length of the `ops` array, which is not what the original code intended to do.

DONE.
