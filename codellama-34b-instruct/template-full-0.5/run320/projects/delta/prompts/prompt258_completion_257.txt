  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are different properties of the `thisOp` object, and the code is likely relying on the specific values of these properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is a different object than `thisOp`, and the code is likely relying on the specific values of the properties of `thisOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is likely relying on the specific values of the properties of `thisOp`, and `null` is not a valid value for these properties.

DONE.
