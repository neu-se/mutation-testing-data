  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.replace(/\./g, '-')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace all periods in the hostname with hyphens, which could cause the URL parsing logic to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split('.').reverse().join('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the hostname into an array of subdomains, the `reverse` method would reverse the order of the subdomains, and the `join` method would join the subdomains back into a string, which could cause the URL parsing logic to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring of the hostname starting from the second character, which could cause the URL parsing logic to fail.

DONE.
