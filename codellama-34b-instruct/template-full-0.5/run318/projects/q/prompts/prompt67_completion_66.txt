  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function call, whereas the original code fragment `flush` is a reference to the `flush` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the `flush` variable, whereas the original code fragment `flush` is a reference to the `flush` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush = undefined` assigns `undefined` to the `flush` variable, whereas the original code fragment `flush` is a reference to the `flush` variable.

DONE.
