  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(object instanceof Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `typeof` operator checks the type of a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(object.constructor === Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` property of an object refers to the constructor function used to create the object, while `typeof` operator checks the type of a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(object[Symbol.toStringTag] === 'Object')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.toStringTag` property of an object refers to the type of the object, while `typeof` operator checks the type of a variable.

DONE.
