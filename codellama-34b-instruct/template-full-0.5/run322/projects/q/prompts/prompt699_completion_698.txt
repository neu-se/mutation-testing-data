  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `array_slice` function is now `2`, which would include the second argument of the `fbind` function in the `args` array, whereas the original code fragment did not include the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `array_slice` function is now `0`, which would exclude all arguments of the `fbind` function from the `args` array, whereas the original code fragment included all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `array_slice` function is now `void 0`, which would include all arguments of the `fbind` function in the `args` array, whereas the original code fragment did not include the second argument.

DONE.
