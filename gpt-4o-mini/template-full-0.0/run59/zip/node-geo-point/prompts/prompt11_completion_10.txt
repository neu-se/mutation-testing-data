Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coords'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now expect a property named `coords` instead of `coordinates`, leading to a TypeError when the expected property is not found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for a property that concatenates `coordinates` with `extra`, which will never exist, causing a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for a property named `coordinates1`, which does not exist, leading to a TypeError when the expected property is not found.

DONE.
