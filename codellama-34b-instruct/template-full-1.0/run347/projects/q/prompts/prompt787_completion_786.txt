  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.catch is deprecated");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error whenever the `catch` method is called, making it impossible to use the method for its intended purpose.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fail(rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fail` method on the promise, which is not a real method in ES6 Promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `catch` method on the promise, which is not a real method in ES6 Promises.

DONE.
