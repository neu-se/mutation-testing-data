  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert` is a method that is not defined in the `Delta` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is a method that is not defined in the `Delta` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` is a method that is not defined in the `Delta` class, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
