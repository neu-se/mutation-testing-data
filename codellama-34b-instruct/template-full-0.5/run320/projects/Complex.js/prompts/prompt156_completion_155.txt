  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the complex number is zero, while the modified code fragment is checking if the complex number is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the complex number is zero, while the modified code fragment is checking if the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the complex number is zero, while the modified code fragment is checking if the complex number is not a number (NaN).

DONE.
