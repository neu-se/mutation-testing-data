  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` is the total number of operations in the array, whereas `this.index` is the current index in the array. If `this.ops.length` is used, the `slice` method will return the entire array, rather than just the remaining elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index + 1` would skip over the first element in the array, rather than starting at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(this.index, this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ensure that the `slice` method starts at the current index, or the end of the array, whichever is shorter. If `this.index` is greater than `this.ops.length`, it would return an empty array
