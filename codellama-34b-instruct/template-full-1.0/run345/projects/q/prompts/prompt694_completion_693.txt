  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(1)` is not a reference to the `Q` variable, but rather a call to the `Q` function with the argument `1`. This would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a call to the `defer` method of the `Q` object, and it would likely create a new deferred object that is not needed in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q["make"]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q["make"]()` is not a valid method of the `Q` object, and it would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
