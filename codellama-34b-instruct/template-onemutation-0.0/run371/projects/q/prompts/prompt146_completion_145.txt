  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was looking for the minimum stack counter, while the new code fragment is looking for the maximum stack counter. This would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to behave differently when concatenating the stack traces of `promise` and `error`.
