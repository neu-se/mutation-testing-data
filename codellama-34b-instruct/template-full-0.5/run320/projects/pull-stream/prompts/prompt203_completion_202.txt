  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will negate the truthiness of the `end` variable, which means that the `if` statement will always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator will add 1 to the value of `end`, which means that the `if` statement will always evaluate to `true` if `end` is greater than or equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator will subtract 1 from the value of `end`, which means that the `if` statement will always evaluate to `true` if `end` is less than or equal to 1.

DONE.
