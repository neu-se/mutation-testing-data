  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `places` parameter is used as the base for the exponential function, while in the modified code, it is used as the exponent. This would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `places` parameter is used as the base for the exponential function, while in the modified code, it is used as the exponent. This would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `places` parameter is used as the base for the exponential function, while in the modified code, it is used as the exponent. This would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
