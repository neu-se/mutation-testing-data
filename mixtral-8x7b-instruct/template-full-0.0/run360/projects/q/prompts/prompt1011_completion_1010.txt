 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `defer()` creates a new deferred object, while `Promise.resolve()` immediately resolves to a fulfilled promise. This change would bypass the asynchronous behavior intended by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `defer()` does not pass any arguments to the `resolve` method, while this change would always pass `null` as the resolved value. This could cause issues if the downstream code expects different resolved values based on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `defer()` does not reject the promise, while this change would immediately reject the promise with an error message. This would bypass any successful resolution and cause downstream error handling
