Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current operation and return the rest of the operations starting from the next index, rather than including the current operation in the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rest of the operations in reverse order, which changes the sequence of operations that are expected to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index).map(op => ({ ...op, retain: 0 }));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify all remaining operations to have a `retain` value of `0`, effectively nullifying their effect, rather than returning them unchanged.

DONE.
