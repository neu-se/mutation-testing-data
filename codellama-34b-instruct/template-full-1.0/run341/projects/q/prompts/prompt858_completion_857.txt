  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `timeoutId`, which is a variable that references a timeout ID that was previously set with `setTimeout`. When `clearTimeout` is called with `null` as the timeout ID, it will not clear any existing timeouts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `timeoutId`, which is a variable that references a timeout ID that was previously set with `setTimeout`. When `clearTimeout` is called with `undefined` as the timeout ID, it will not clear any existing timeouts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `timeoutId`, which is a variable that references a timeout ID that was previously set with `setTimeout`. When `clearTimeout` is called with `0` as the timeout ID, it will
