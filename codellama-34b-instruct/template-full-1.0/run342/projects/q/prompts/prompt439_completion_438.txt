  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-promise
```
This would result in different behavior because negating a promise would invert its resolution state, leading to a different outcome in the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and its resolution state would be different from a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(promise + true)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a boolean value to a promise would convert it to a number, leading to a different resolution state.

DONE.
