Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the queue with `null` instead of the `end` object would cause the queue to not properly handle the error, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve values from the closed queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({head: Q.resolve("Unexpected Value")});
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the queue with a promise that resolves to "Unexpected Value" instead of the intended error would allow the queue to return a value when it should be closed, violating the expected behavior of a closed queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(ends.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the queue with its own promise would create a circular reference, potentially leading to infinite loops or stack overflow errors when trying to access the queue's values.

DONE.
