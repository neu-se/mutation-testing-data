  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the callback is called with `null` as the first argument, whereas in the mutated code, it is called with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the callback is called with `null` as the first argument, whereas in the mutated code, it is called with `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the callback is called with `null` as the first argument, whereas in the mutated code, it is called with the string `'null'`.

DONE.
