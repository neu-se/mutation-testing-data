  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would be called with a zoom level that is one level lower than the original zoom level, which could result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(zoom / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would be called with a zoom level that is half the original zoom level, which could result in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(zoom / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would be called with a zoom level that is half the original zoom level rounded up, which could result in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
