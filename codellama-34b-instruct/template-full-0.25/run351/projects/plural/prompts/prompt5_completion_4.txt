  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument passed to `bind`, which in this case is the `Object.prototype.toString` function. This means that the new function will always return the string representation of the `Object.prototype.toString` function, rather than the string representation of the object that was passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument passed to `bind`, which in this case is `null`. This means that the new function will always return the string representation of `null`, rather than the string representation of the object that was passed to it.
