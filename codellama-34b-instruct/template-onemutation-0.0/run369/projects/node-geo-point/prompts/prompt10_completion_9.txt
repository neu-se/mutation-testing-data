  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object` prototype, and it is not guaranteed to be present on all objects. By using `call`, we ensure that the method is called on the correct object, even if it is not present on the object itself.

DONE.
