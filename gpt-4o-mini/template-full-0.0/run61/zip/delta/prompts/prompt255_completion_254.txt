Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to process one extra operation than intended, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the delta operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the number of operations processed by one, which could lead to missing out on important changes in the delta, resulting in an incomplete transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation from the `otherIter` instead of the current `opLength`, which could lead to mismatched operations being processed and incorrect delta results.

DONE.
