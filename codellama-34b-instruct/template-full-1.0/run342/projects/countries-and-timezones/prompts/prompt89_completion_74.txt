  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents 
Not a Number, and it would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `+Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript that represents 
positive infinity, and it would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `-Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript that represents 
negative infinity, and it would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
