  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` is an integer, and adding 1 to it would change the value of the integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` is an integer, and multiplying it by 2 would change the value of the integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` is an integer, and dividing it by 2 would change the value of the integer.

DONE.
