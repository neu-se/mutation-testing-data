  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return fulfilled(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` callback is not defined in the current context, so it would throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the current context, so it would throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is resolved with the exception, which would result in a different resolution value than the original code.

DONE.
