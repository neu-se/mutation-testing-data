  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call. This would cause the `map` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call with a specific `this` context. This would cause the `map` function to be called with a different `this` context, which could potentially change its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call with a specific `this` context and arguments. This would cause the `map
