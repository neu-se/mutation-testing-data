  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `null` instead of the expected URL object, which could cause the `gettype` function to throw an error or return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to a hardcoded URL instead of the expected URL object, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = URL.parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to a URL object parsed from the `baseUrlStr` variable, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results if the `baseUrlStr` variable is not a valid URL.

DONE.
