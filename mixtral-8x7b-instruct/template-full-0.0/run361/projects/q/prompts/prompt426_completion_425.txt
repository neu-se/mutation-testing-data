 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state || "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the state is explicitly equal to "fulfilled", while the modified code would treat any falsy value as "fulfilled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state === "something-else";
