  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return the same value for both the latitude and longitude, regardless of the input precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a value that is one degree of longitude greater than the input value, regardless of the input precision.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a value that is the sum of the latitude and longitude, regardless of the input precision.

DONE.
