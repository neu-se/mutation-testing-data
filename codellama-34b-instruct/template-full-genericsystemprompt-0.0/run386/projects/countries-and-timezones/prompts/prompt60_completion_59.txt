  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` option is set to `true`, which would return a different set of countries than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { allTimezones: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allTimezones` option is set to `true`, which would return a different set of timezones than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { timezones: [] });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` option is set to an empty array, which would return a different set of timezones than the original code fragment.

DONE.
