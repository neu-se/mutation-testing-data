  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` takes a `value` argument instead of a `reason` argument, which could cause the promise to resolve with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` takes a `reason` argument instead of a `value` argument, which could cause the promise to reject with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` takes a `progress` argument instead of a `value` argument, which could cause the promise to notify with an unexpected value.

DONE.
