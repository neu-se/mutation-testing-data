  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["different", "arguments"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different set of arguments to the function.

DONE.
