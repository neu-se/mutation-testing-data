 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is used to create a new deferred object, while `Promise.resolve()` creates a resolved promise. This change would cause the returned promise to always be resolved immediately, regardless of the state of the input promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is the deprecated way of creating a deferred object in the Q library. Using this would cause the code to use the deprecated API, which may have different behavior or be removed in future versions of the library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Deferred not available'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of creating a deferred object. This would cause any promise that uses this deferred object to immediately reject with the error.
