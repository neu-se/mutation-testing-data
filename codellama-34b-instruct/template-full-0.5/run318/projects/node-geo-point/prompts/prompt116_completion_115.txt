  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing + 180);
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is now calculated as 180 degrees different from the original bearing, which would result in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is now calculated as twice the original bearing, which would result in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing + Math.PI);
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is now calculated as 180 degrees different from the original bearing, which would result in a different destination point.

DONE.
