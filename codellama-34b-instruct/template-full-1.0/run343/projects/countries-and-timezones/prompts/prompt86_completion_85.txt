  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `options` object as the second argument to the `getCountry` function, which is not valid and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `tz` variable (which is a timezone object) as the first argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause an error because `getCountry` expects a country code (string) as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause an error because `getCountry` expects a valid country code (string) as the first argument.

DONE.
