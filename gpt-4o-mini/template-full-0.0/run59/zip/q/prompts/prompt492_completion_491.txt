Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `this` would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not correctly reference the current promise context, potentially leading to incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because using `promise` instead of `this` would cause the `untrackRejection` function to reference the promise object directly, which may not be the same as the context of the current promise, leading to incorrect tracking of rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `this` would mean that the `untrackRejection` function would not have a valid context for the promise, which could result in the promise being incorrectly untracked or not tracked at all.

DONE.
