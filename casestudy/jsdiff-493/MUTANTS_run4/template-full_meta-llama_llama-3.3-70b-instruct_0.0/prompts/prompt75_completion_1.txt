Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `hasOwnProperty` method directly on the `obj` object, potentially leading to incorrect results if `obj` has overridden this method, whereas the original code uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` to ensure the method is called on the object's prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of the key in the object's prototype chain, whereas the original code only checks for own properties using `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, potentially leading to different results if the object has inherited properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, effectively including all keys in the `sortedKeys` array, whereas the original code filters out keys that are not own properties of the object, potentially leading to incorrect serialization of the object.

DONE.
