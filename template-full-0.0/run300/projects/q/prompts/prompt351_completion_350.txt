  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self,
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, this,
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, and would cause the `reject` function to be called with the global object as its argument, rather than the `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, null,
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and would cause the `reject` function to be called with `null` as its argument, rather than the `exception` object.

DONE.
