  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, while the new code fragment uses the `==` operator, which would allow for looser equality checks. This could potentially cause the `done` callback to be called with a different value than expected, leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
