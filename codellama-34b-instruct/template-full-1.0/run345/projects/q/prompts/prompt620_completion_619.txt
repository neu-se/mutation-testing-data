  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (o) { return o.dispatch; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not applied to the object, but rather to the promise returned by `Q(object)`, causing the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch(function (err) { return err.dispatch; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not applied to the object, but rather to the promise returned by `Q(object)`, causing the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally(function (o) { return o.dispatch; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not applied to the object, but rather to the promise returned by `Q(object)`, causing the `dispatch` method to be
