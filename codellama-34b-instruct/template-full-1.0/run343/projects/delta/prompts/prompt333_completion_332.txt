  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a property of an Op object, but `attributes` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a method of an Op object, but `attributes` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
DONE.
```
