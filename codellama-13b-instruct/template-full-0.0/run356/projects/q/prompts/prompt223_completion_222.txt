  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create(null)` creates a new object with no prototype, whereas `object_create(defer.prototype)` creates a new object with the prototype of the `defer` function. This could potentially cause issues if the `defer` function is not intended to be used as a prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(defer.prototype, {
    promise: {
        value: promise,
        writable: false,
        enumerable: false,
        configurable: false
    }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with the prototype of the `defer` function and sets the `promise` property to the `promise` object. This could potentially cause issues if the `defer` function is not intended to be used as a prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create
