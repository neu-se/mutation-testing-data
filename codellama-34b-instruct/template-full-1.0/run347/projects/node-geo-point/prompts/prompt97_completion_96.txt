  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the x-coordinate instead of the y-coordinate, which would lead to a different calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinÎ¸
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the sine of the bearing instead of the cosine, which would lead to a different calculation of the true course.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the logarithm of the x-coordinate instead of the coordinate itself, which would lead to a different calculation of the distance.

DONE.
