  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with its original value, rather than the value returned by the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return Q.resolve(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a new promise that is resolved with the original value, rather than the original value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return Q.reject(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the original value, rather than being resolved with the value returned by the callback.

DONE.
