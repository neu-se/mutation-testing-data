  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the magnitude of the complex number, while the modified code fragment calculates the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the magnitude of the complex number, while the modified code fragment calculates the difference between the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the magnitude of the complex number, while the modified code fragment calculates the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

DONE.
