  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would not be called, and the promise would be resolved with the value returned by the `resolve` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Invalid operation"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a new `Error` object, and the promise would be rejected with that error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid operation")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown, and the promise would be rejected with that error.

DONE.
