  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject("buggy code")
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` expects a function as its second argument, but `undefined` is not a function, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, which would cause an error.

DONE.
