  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `URL.parse()` to parse the URL, which would return a `URL` object with the protocol included. However, the replaced code fragment uses `String.replace()` to remove the protocol from the URL, which would result in a different URL object being created.
