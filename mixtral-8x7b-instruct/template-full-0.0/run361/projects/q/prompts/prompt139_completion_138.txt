 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.stack` check in the `if` statement would throw a TypeError, since `null` does not have a `stack` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.stack` check in the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, since an empty object does not have a `stack` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.stack` check in the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, since a resolved promise does not have a `stack` property.

DONE.
