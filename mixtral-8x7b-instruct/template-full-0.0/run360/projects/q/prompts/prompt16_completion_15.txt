 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition will always be falsy, and the code block below it will not execute in any environment, including browsers where `window` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined' === typeof window
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition will always be falsy, as the `typeof` operator returns a string. The code block below it will not execute in any environment, including browsers where `window` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(window) === '[object global]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition checks for the `window` object being an instance of the `global` object, which is not the case in most environments. The code block below it will not execute, and the global `Q` variable will not be initialized as expected.

DONE.
