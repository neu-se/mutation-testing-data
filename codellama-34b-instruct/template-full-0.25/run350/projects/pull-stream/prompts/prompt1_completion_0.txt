  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, since `k` would be initialized to 0 and never change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Object.keys(sources).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate `Object.keys(sources).length` times, which may be more or less than the actual number of elements in the `sources` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate a random number of times, which could be anywhere from 0 to `Infinity`.

DONE.
