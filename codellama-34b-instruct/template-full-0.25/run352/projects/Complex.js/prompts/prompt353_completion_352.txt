  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.cos(b)` instead of `Math.sin(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sin(b)` instead of `Math.cos(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sin(b)` instead of `Math.cos(b)`.

DONE.
