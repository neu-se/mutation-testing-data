  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of the `Function` prototype, and it is not clear why it is being used in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method of the `Function` prototype, and it is not clear why it is being used in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method of the `Function` prototype, and it is not clear why it is being used in this context.

DONE.
