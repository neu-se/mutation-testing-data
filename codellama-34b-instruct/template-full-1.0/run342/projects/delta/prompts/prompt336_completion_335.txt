  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is an object, and `op.retain instanceof Array` would evaluate to `false`, even if `op.retain` has a property named `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is an object, and `typeof op.retain === 'function'` would evaluate to `false`, even if `op.retain` has a property named `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(op.retain, 'length')
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is an object, and `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(op.retain, 'length')` would evaluate to `true`, even if `op.retain`
