  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire `part` string to the `props` array, rather than the expected `part.slice(1)` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part + ' mistakes')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a string concatenation of the `part` string and the `mistakes` string to the `props` array, rather than the expected `part.slice(1)` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push('something else')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the string `'something else'` to the `props` array, rather than the expected `part.slice(1)` string.

DONE.
