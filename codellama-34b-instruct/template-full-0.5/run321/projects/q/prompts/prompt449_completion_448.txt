  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so it would not be treated as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so it would not be treated as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(reason)` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called, which would remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
