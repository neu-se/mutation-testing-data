  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` would convert the string to an array, whereas `replace` would replace parts of the string with the specified replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` would extract a portion of the string, whereas `replace` would replace parts of the string with the specified replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` would extract a portion of the string, whereas `replace` would replace parts of the string with the specified replacement.

DONE.
