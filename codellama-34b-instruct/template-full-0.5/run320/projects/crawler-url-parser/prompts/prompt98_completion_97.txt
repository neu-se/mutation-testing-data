  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the current URL is already in the map, while this modified code checks if the current URL is already in the map and if the text of the current URL is already included in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the current URL is already in the map, while this modified code checks if the current URL is not already in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text !== text
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the current URL is already in the map, while this modified code checks if the current URL is
