  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb === null` is a strict equality check, whereas `!cb` is a negation of the truthiness of `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc === null` is a strict equality check, whereas `!cb` is a negation of the truthiness of `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `!acc` is a negation of the truthiness of `acc`, whereas `!cb` is a negation of the truthiness of `cb`.

DONE.
