  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute is not being accessed properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('src')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is not being accessed properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('action')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `action` attribute is not being accessed properly.

DONE.
