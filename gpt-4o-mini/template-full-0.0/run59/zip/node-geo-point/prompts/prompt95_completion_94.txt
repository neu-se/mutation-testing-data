Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from the sine of φ1 to the cosine of φ1, which will yield incorrect results for the latitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 + sinδ
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the sine of φ1 to the sine of δ, which does not represent the correct mathematical relationship needed to calculate sinφ2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the calculation of sinφ2 with the sine of the bearing angle θ, which is not relevant to the latitude calculation and will lead to incorrect destination coordinates.

DONE.
