 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 1 instead of the original word, which can cause tests to fail if the expected result is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase()}
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the word to uppercase, which can cause tests to fail if the expected result is a specific case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'x'}
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'x' to the end of the word, which can cause tests to fail if the expected result does not include 'x'.

DONE.
