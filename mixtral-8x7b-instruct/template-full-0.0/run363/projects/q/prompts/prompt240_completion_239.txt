 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns false, causing the resolvedPromise to never be replaced with nearerValue, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise resolution process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null === nearerValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null equality, which might not be the intended condition. If nearerValue is not null, the resolvedPromise will not be replaced, potentially causing issues in the promise resolution process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nearerValue !== 'promise'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type of nearerValue being not equal to 'promise', which is the opposite of the original condition. This would cause the resolvedPromise to be replaced with nearerValue in incorrect situations, leading to unexpected behavior in the promise resolution process.

DONE.
