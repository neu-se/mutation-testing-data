  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array. In this case, the `addRule` function is called with the `rules` array as an argument, and the new rule is added to the beginning of the array using `unshift`. If `push` were used instead, the new rule would be added to the end of the array, which could potentially cause issues with the order in which the rules are applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.splice(0, 0, [match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to a specific index in the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array. In this case, the `addRule` function is called with the `rules` array as an argument, and the new rule is added to the beginning of the array using `unshift`. If
