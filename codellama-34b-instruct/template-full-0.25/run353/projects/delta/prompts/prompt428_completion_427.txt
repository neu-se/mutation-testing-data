  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null && typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not null and then checks if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null && typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not null, if it is an object, and if its constructor is the `Object` constructor.

DONE.
