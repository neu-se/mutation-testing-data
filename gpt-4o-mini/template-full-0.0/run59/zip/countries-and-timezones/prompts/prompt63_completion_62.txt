Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a valid `id` would cause `buildCountry` to receive an invalid argument, potentially leading to an error or unexpected result when trying to build the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, 'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a string `'unknown'` as the `id` would likely not correspond to any valid country in the `data.countries` object, resulting in `countries[id]` being `undefined` and potentially causing `memoizeCountry` to be called with an invalid country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because appending `'1'` to the `id` would change the lookup key, leading to a situation where `buildCountry` is called with an id that does not exist in the `data.countries`, which would again result in `undefined` being passed to `memoizeCountry`.

DONE.
