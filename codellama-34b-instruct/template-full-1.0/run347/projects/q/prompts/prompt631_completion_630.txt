  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `remove` method does not exist on the object, so the promise resolution would be rejected with a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method sets a property on the object, so the promise resolution would be fulfilled with the result of the property set, which may be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value of the property on the object, which may be different from the original code if the property has been changed.

DONE.
