Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` would cause the `fulfilled` function to receive `null` as the first argument, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the function expects a valid object or value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different primitive value than `void 0`, and while they are often treated similarly in JavaScript, certain operations or checks may yield different results, especially in strict mode or when checking for property existence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty string as the first argument would change the context in which the `fulfilled` function operates, potentially leading to errors if the function tries to access properties or methods on an empty string.

DONE.
