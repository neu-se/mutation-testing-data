  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true`, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is `false`. This change would cause the function to behave differently when the `end` argument is `true`.

DONE.
