  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a method that applies the promised function in a future turn, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fbind(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` is a method that binds the promised function, transforming return values into a fulfilled promise and thrown errors into a rejected one, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a method that calls the promised function in a future turn, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

DONE.
