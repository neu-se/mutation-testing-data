 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to Infinity, instead of checking if the value is Infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is equal to Infinity, instead of checking if the value is Infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, regardless of the input, causing the function to return Complex['INFINITY'] in all cases.

DONE.
