  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'ies' suffix, while this new code fragment uses the 'es' suffix.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'ies' suffix, while this new code fragment uses the 's' suffix.

DONE.
