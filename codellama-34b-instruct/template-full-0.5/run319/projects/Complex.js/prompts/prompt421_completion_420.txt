  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` is a method that checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, which inverts the result of the expression. So if the original expression evaluated to `true`, the new expression would evaluate to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while the original expression checks if the entire complex number is equal to zero.

DONE.
