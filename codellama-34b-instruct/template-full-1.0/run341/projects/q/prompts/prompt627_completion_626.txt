  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"settle"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the incorrect operation name, causing the `.set(key, value)` method to not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the incorrect operation name, causing the `.set(key, value)` method to not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the incorrect operation name, causing the `.set(key, value)` method to not work as intended.

DONE.
