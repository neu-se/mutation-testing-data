  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `rejected` value, so the `untrackRejection` function would be called even if the promise is not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the `untrackRejection` function would not be called if `rejected` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the `untrackRejection` function would be called if `rejected` is `true`.

DONE.
