  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.latitude, coordinate.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same point as the input, effectively cancelling out the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.latitude + 1, coordinate.longitude + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a point that is one degree north and one degree east of the input point, which would result in an incorrect calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.latitude * 2, coordinate.longitude * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a point that is twice as far north and east as the input point, which would result in an incorrect calculation.

DONE.
