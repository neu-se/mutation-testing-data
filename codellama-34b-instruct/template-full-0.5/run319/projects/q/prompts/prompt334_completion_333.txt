  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` would return the value of the `state` property of the `inspect` object, whereas `inspect` on its own would return the `inspect` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.toString()` would return the string representation of the `inspect` object, whereas `inspect` on its own would return the `inspect` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the `inspect` object, whereas `inspect` on its own would return the `inspect` object itself.

DONE.
