  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` will be decremented instead of incremented, potentially causing the loop to iterate more or fewer times than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` will be incremented by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate more times than intended, as `i` would be incremented twice (once in the loop header, and once in the body of the loop).

DONE.
