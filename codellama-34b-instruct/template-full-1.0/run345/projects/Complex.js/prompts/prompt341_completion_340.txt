  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the multiplication operator (`*`) instead of the addition operator (`+`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) + sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the multiplication operator (`*`) instead of the addition operator (`+`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the multiplication operator (`*`) instead of the sine function (`Math.sin()`).

DONE.
