  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `rest` except for the first one, whereas `rest` itself is an array that contains all elements of `ops` starting from the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(0, 1)` would return a new array containing only the first element of `rest`, whereas `rest` itself is an array that contains all elements of `ops` starting from the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(0, -1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `rest` except for the last one, whereas `rest` itself is an array that contains all elements of `ops`
