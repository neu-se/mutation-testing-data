  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `0` as the value for the first argument, but `1` as the value for the second argument. Changing the value of the first argument would change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `array_slice` with one argument, but this replacement code fragment calls it with two arguments. The difference in arguments would cause the `array_slice` function to have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```variableName
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the value of the `variableName` variable as the first argument, but this replacement code fragment uses the value of the `variableName` variable as the second argument. Changing the order of the arguments would cause the function to have different behavior.

DONE.
