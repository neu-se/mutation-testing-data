  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.inspect = function () {
    return {state: "rejected", reason: "Promise was rejected"};
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to always return a rejected state, even if the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.inspect = function () {
    return {state: "pending", reason: "Promise is pending"};
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to always return a pending state, even if the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.inspect = function () {
    return {state: "fulfilled", value: "Promise was fulfilled"};
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to always return a fulfilled
