  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked with `undefined` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original behavior where the callback is invoked with `array[i++]` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked with an empty array as the second argument, which is not the same as the original behavior where the callback is invoked with `array[i++]` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked with `null` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original behavior where the callback is invoked with `array[i++]` as the second argument.

DONE.
