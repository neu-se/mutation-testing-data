  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the function to be called immediately and its return value to be compared to `z['isInfinite']`, rather than the function itself being compared.
