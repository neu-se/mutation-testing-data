  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined for the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return value.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined for the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(function (value) { return value.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined for the `promise` object.

DONE.
