  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is not defined in the function, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` would be evaluated to a different value than `x`, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` would be evaluated to a different value than `x`, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
