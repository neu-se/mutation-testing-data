  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would shift the latitude by 1 degree, which would cause the `toTile()` function to return a different tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the latitude, which would cause the `toTile()` function to return a different tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 degree from the latitude, which would cause the `toTile()` function to return a different tile coordinate.

DONE.
