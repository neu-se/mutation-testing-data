  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method being called from "post" to "get", which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the order of the arguments being passed to the "post" method, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the second argument to the "post" method, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
