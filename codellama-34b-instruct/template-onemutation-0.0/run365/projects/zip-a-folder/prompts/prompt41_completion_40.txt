  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a comma operator, which evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the second operand. Replacing it with a semicolon would cause the code to break, as the semicolon is not a valid operator in this context.

DONE.
