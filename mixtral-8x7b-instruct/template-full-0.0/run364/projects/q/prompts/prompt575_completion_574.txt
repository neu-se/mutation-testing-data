 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind.call(continuer, continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.prototype.bind.call` instead of `bind`, which may have different behavior in some environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer.bind(continuer, "next", void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an additional `void 0` argument to `bind`, which may change the value of `this` in the `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function(verb, arg) { return continuer(verb, arg) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `continuer` function in an anonymous function, which may change the behavior of the `when` function that is called within `continuer`.

DONE.
