  Thank you for providing me with the code for mutation testing. I have come up with three options to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[3], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is being referenced differently. Instead of using `ref[0]` through `ref[2]`, we are using `ref[1]` through `ref[4]`. This could cause the code to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], "..."
```
This would result in different behavior because we are adding a new element to the `ref` array, which could change the behavior of the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because we are repeating the same element in
