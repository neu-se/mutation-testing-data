  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would catch the error and pass it to the next promise, while this modified code fragment would throw the error immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would catch the error and pass it to the next promise, while this modified code fragment would return the error instead of throwing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would catch the error and pass it to the next promise, while this modified code fragment would return a rejected promise with the error instead of throwing it.

DONE.
