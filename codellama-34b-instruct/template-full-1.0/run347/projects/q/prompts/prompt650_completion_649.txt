  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer dispatch the "post" action to the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q('foo').dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the "post" action to the string "foo" instead of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q('foo').dispatch('bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the "bar" action to the string "foo" instead of the object, and it would use the string "bar" as the action argument, instead of the arguments array.

DONE.
