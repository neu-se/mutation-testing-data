  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `false`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `end` is `false`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `null`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `end` is `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because
