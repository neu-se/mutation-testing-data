  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the value of the property with the name `key + 1`, rather than the value of the property with the name `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the value of the property with the name `key - 1`, rather than the value of the property with the name `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the value of the property with the name `key * 2`, rather than the value of the property with the name `key`.

DONE.
