  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code fragment is using `this`, which refers to the promise object, while replacing it with a string would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the string object instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code fragment is using `this`, which refers to the promise object, while replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `undefined` object instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code fragment is using `this`, which refers to the promise object, while replacing it with `null` would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `null` object instead.

DONE.
