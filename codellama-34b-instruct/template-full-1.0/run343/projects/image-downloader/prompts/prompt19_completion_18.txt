  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is absolute, while this code fragment checks if the URL is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest[0] === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.isAbsolute()` to check if the destination path is absolute, while this code fragment checks if the first character of the destination path is a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is absolute, while this code fragment checks if the destination path does not start with "http".

DONE.
