  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string' && nextOp.retain !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `retain` property of `nextOp` is a string and not an empty string, instead of checking if it is an object and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null && nextOp.retain !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `retain` property of `nextOp` is an object and not null, and also not an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function' && nextOp.retain !== function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `retain` property of `nextOp` is a function and not an empty function.

DONE.
