Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes only the last character of the word instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'ices' to the original word without removing any characters, which is not the intended pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces 'ices' with 's', which is incorrect for the words 'appendix' and 'index', as they should be pluralized to 'appendices' and 'indices', respectively.

DONE.
