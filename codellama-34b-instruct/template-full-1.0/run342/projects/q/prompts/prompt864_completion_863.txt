  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(1+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `.delay` method to return a promise that is immediately resolved with the value `2`, instead of the original promise that was returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `.delay` method to return a promise that is immediately resolved with the value `value`, instead of the original promise that was returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `.delay` method to return a promise that is immediately resolved with the value `value+1`, instead of the original promise that was returned.

DONE.
