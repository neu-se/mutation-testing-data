  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include operations with an `insert` property in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include operations with a `delete` property in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include operations with a `retain` property in the resulting array.

DONE.
