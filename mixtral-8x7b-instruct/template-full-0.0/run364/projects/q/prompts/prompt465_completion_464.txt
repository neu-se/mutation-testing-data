 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` check for the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would always return -1, as an empty array is not equal to an array with a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{promise: null}
