  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is applied to the difference between the two longitude values, instead of the difference between the two latitude values as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = sin(point2Rad) * cos(point1Rad) * cos(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is applied to the difference between the two longitude values, instead of the difference between the two latitude values as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = cos(point2Rad) * cos(point1Rad) * cos(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is applied to the difference between the two longitude values, instead of the difference between the two latitude values as in the original code.

DONE.
