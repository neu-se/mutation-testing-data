  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/EOL/g, '\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/EOL/g` matches the string "EOL" instead of the newline character, and the replacement string is changed to "\r\n" instead of EOL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/EOL/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/EOL/g` matches the string "EOL" instead of the newline character, and the replacement string is changed to an empty string instead of EOL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/EOL/g, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/EOL/g` matches the string "EOL" instead of the newline character, and the replacement string is changed to a space character instead of EOL.

DONE.
