  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` method would treat the `NULL_CHARACTER` as a valid character and include it in the diff, whereas the original code fragment would ignore the `NULL_CHARACTER` as a placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` method would treat the empty string as a valid character and include it in the diff, whereas the original code fragment would ignore the `NULL_CHARACTER` as a placeholder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff()` method would treat the space character as a valid character and include it in the diff, whereas the original code fragment would ignore the `NULL_CHARACTER` as a placeholder.

DONE.
