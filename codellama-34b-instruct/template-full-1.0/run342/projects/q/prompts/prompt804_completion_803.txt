  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator returns `undefined`, while `null` returns `null`, which may have different behavior in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is an array, and `progressed[0]` may refer to a different element in the array, depending on the specific implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, progressed, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the callback function may affect the behavior of the code.

DONE.
