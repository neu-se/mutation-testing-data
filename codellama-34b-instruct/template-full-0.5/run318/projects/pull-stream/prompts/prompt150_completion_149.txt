  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if either `abort` or `value` is truthy. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` only if both `abort` and `value` are truthy. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
