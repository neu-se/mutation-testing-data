  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method on `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object, but replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method on an empty object.

DONE.
