  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward to the previous operation, potentially skipping over the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation after the current one, potentially skipping over the current operation.

DONE.
