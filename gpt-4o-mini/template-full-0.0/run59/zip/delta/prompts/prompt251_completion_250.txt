Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` to be one more than the actual length of the next operation in `otherIter`, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length of the operation being processed from `thisIter` by one, which could lead to incorrect retention or deletion of operations, affecting the final delta result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation being processed from `otherIter`, which could cause the algorithm to process more operations than intended, leading to incorrect diffs and potentially missing operations in the final delta.

DONE.
