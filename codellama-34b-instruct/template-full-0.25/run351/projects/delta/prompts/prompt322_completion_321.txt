  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting from the end of the current slice, rather than the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex - length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting from a position before the current slice, rather than the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting from a position after the current slice, rather than the beginning.

DONE.
