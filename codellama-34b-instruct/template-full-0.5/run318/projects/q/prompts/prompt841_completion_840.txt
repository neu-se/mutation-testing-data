  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would not throw an error and would simply call the `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would call the `onUnhandledError` function with a new error object, whereas the original code would not call the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would reject the promise with a new error object, whereas the original code would not reject the promise.

DONE.
