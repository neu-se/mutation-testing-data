 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.hasOwnProperty('toString')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `toString` property exists directly on the `process` object, rather than checking if `process` is a specific type of object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `toString` method on the `Object.prototype` object, passing `process` as the `this` value, rather than checking if `process` is a specific type of object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'[object ' + typeof process + ']'
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs a string that includes the result of the `typeof` operator for the `process` variable, rather than checking if `process` is a specific type of object.

DONE.
