  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with `true` as the argument, which would cause it to immediately call the `onEnd` callback with `null` as the argument, regardless of whether the `read` function has been called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with `false` as the argument, which would cause it to immediately call the `onEnd` callback with `null` as the argument, regardless of whether the `read` function has been called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause it to immediately call the `onEnd` callback with `null` as the argument, regardless of whether the `read` function has been called.
