  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt1[1], Number(attempt1[2]) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number in the stack trace would be incremented by 1, causing the stack trace to point to a different line in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt2[1], Number(attempt2[2]) - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number in the stack trace would be decremented by 1, causing the stack trace to point to a different line in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt3[1], Number(attempt3[2]) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number in the stack trace would be multiplied by 2, causing the stack trace to point to a different line in the code.

DONE.
