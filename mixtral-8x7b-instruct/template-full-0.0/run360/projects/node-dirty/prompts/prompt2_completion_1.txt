 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFileSync(this.path, 'utf-8')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads the file synchronously, blocking the execution of further code, unlike the original asynchronous `createReadStream` approach.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a function to `process.nextTick` would cause an error, as `process.nextTick` expects a function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream(this.path, {
  encoding: 'utf-8',
  flags: 'r',
  mode: 0o444 // Adding an unnecessary 'mode' option
})
```
This would result in different behavior because adding an unnecessary `mode` option to `createReadStream` would not cause an error, but it might affect the file permissions, depending
