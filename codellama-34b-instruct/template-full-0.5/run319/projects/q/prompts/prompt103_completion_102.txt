  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index]++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `this[index]` instead of returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this[index]` to `null` instead of returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] = "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this[index]` to the string `"foo"` instead of returning it.

DONE.
