  Sure, here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression pattern used to match words that do not end with a vowel. The original code fragment matches words that end with a vowel and then the letter `o`, while this new code fragment matches words that end with any letter except a vowel and then `o`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w, r) { return w.replace(r, 'ies') })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function used to generate the plural form of words. The original code fragment uses a simple string concatenation to add `s` to the end of the word, while this new code fragment uses a regular expression replacement to replace the `o` with `ies`.
