  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method expects a string or buffer argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method expects a string or buffer argument, and passing `null` would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is not a method of the `WriteStream` class, and it would throw a `TypeError` exception.

DONE.
