  
In this task, you have given a task to make mutations to the code. Several instances of the Array.from method appear in it. One of the artifacts that can easily be created is an empty array. By changing the code and checking if it still works in all scenarios, you can test the code's reliability and consistency. 

Option 1: The PlACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	let tmp2 =Array(va.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the Array.from method is used to create an array of a specific length instance, while a different method, sort, is used to compare two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
let tmp2 =[YNETMATRIS];
```
This would result in different behavior because the Array.from method creates an array of the same length as the original array, while in this case, an empty array, with no length, is created. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
let tmp2 = new Array
