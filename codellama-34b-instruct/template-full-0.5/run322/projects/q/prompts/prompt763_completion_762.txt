  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called on the `Q` function, causing the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for all the promises in the array to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called on the `Q` function, causing the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for all the promises in the array to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new deferred object would be created and returned, causing the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the state of the new deferred object, rather than waiting for all the promises in the array to be resolved.

DONE.
