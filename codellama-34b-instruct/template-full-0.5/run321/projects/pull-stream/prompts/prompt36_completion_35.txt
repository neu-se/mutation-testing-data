  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now accessing the fourth element of the `ref` array instead of the third.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now accessing the first element of the `ref` array instead of the third.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now accessing the second element of the `ref` array instead of the third.

DONE.
