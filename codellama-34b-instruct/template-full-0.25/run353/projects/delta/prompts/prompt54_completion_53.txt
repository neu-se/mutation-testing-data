  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `Array.isArray(ops)`, so if `ops` is an array, the code would enter the `if` block, but if it's not an array, it would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) && ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator requires both operands to be true, so if `ops` is not an array, the code would not enter the `if` block, even if `ops.length > 0` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) || ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator requires at least one operand to be true, so if `ops` is an array, the code
