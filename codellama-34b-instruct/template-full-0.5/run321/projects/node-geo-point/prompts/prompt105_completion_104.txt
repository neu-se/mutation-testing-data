  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 181) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `180` is replaced with `181`, which would result in a different calculation for the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude - 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `180` is replaced with `-180`, which would result in a different calculation for the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude * 2) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `180` is replaced with `2`, which would result in a different calculation for the tile coordinates.

DONE.
