  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() {
  return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']());
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is now defined on the `Complex` prototype, rather than as a standalone function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() {
  return isFinite(this['re']) && isFinite(this['im']);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method now returns `true` if both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are finite, rather than if the number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() {
  return this['re'] === Infinity && this['im'] === Infinity;
};
