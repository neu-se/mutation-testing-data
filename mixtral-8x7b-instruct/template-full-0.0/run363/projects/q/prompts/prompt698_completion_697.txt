 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args.length > 0 ? args : [null];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes an empty array if `args` is not provided, while this change passes `[null]` when `args` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.reject.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with the result of `apply`, while this change rejects the promise with the arguments passed to `fbind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(promises.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with the original `promises` array, while this change resolves the promise with a copy of the `promises` array. This could lead to different behavior if the original array is modified after the `all` function is called.
