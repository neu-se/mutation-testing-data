  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments passed to the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line, while `null` is not an array and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments passed to the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line, while `undefined` is not an array and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments passed to the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line, while `[]` is an empty array and would not cause an error, but it would also not pass any arguments to the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.
