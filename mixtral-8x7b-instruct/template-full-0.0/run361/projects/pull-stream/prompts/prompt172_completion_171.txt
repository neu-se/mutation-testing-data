 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `array` is an instance of the `Array` constructor, which would not handle objects with a length property or array-like objects correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `array` has `Array.prototype` in its prototype chain, which would incorrectly consider array-like objects as arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(array) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the internal `[[Class]]` property of the object, which might not be reliable across different JavaScript engines.

DONE.
