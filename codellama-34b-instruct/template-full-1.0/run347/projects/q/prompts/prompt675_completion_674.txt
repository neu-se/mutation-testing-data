  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"applyAsync"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` uses the string "apply" to refer to the `apply` method, but "applyAsync" is not a valid method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` uses the string "apply" to refer to the `apply` method, but "call" refers to the `call` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"mixins"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` uses the string "apply" to refer to the `apply` method, but "mixins" is not a valid method.

DONE.
