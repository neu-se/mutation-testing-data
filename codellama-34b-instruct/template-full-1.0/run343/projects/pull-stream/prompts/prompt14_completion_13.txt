  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This would result in infinite loop because the for-loop condition would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= 0
```
This would result in the for-loop never executing, potentially causing incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1
```
This would result in the last element of the array never being processed, potentially causing incorrect behavior.

DONE.
