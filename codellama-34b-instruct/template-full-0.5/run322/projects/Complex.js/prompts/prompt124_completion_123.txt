  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()`, while the new code only checks for `this['isInfinite']()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()`, while the new code only checks for `z['isInfinite']()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()`, while the new code only checks for `this['isZero']()`.

DONE.
