  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the `thisOp` object, rather than just the length of the `thisOp.retain` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the `otherOp` object, rather than just the length of the `otherOp.retain` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp.retain));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the `thisOp.retain` attribute, rather than the length of the `thisOp` object.

DONE.
