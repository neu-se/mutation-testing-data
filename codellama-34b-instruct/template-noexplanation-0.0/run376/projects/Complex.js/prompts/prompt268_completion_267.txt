  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This change will cause the `abs` method to use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which will result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `abs` method to use the real part of the complex number plus one, which will result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `abs` method to use the imaginary part of the complex number multiplied by two, which will result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
