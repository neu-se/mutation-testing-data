  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Q.nfcall(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a function that returns a promise, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise, so the code would be calling `Q` as a function instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a function that returns a promise, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise, so the code would be calling `Q` as a function instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(callback, this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a function that returns a promise, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise, so the code would be calling `Q` as a function instead of
