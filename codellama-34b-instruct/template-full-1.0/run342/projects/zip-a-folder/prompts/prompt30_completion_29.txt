  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a different event that is emitted by a stream than `close`, and would cause the `resolve` callback to be called with the data event instead of the close event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish' () =>Â { resolve() }
```
This would result in different behavior because `finish` is a different event that is emitted by a stream than `close`, and the callback would be called when the stream has finished writing data, but the `resolve` callback would not be called with the close event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is a different event that is emitted by a stream than `close`, and the `reject` callback would be called when an error occurs in the stream, but the `resolve` callback would not be called with the close event.

DONE
