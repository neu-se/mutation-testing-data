Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument from `void 0` (which is `undefined`) to `null`, potentially altering how the receiving function interprets the first parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `void 0` with `1`, which changes the first argument to a number instead of `undefined`, affecting the function's execution and possibly leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array_slice(arguments, 0, 1), array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument to be the first element of the `arguments` array instead of `undefined`, which could lead to different handling of the function's parameters.

DONE.
