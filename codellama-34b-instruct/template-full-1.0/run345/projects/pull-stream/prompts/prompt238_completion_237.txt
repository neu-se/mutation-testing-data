  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end-1, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with the same `end` value as the original code, which could potentially cause issues if the callback is expecting a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, cb
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, because the `end` value is not changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end+1, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a different `end` value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues if the callback is expecting a specific value.

DONE.
