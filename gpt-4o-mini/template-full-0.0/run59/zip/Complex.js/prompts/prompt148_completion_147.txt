Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the multiplication of an infinite complex number with zero to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']`, which changes the expected outcome of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the multiplication of an infinite complex number with another infinite complex number to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']`, which alters the mathematical correctness of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the multiplication of an infinite complex number with zero as `Complex['NAN']` when it should not, leading to incorrect handling of the operation involving infinity.

DONE.
