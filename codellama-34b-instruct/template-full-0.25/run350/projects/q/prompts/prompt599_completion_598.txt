  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` is a different value than `args`, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` is a different value than `args`, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(args)` is a different value than `args`, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
