  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `read` function would not be called, and the drain would not happen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `read` function would not be called, and the drain would not happen.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abort'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'abort'` is a truthy string value, so the `read` function would be called with `'abort'` as the argument, which would cause the drain to happen.

DONE.
