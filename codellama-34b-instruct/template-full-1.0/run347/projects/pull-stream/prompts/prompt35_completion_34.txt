  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1]` is passed as an argument to the `pull` function, while `ref[0]` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the literal string "test" is not a function and would not be passed as an argument to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[2]` is a different argument than `ref[1]`, and would be passed in a different position in the argument list.

DONE.
