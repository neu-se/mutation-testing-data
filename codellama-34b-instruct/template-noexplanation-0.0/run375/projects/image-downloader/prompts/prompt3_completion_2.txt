  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the error message to refer to the `options.dest` property instead of `options.url`. This could cause the test to fail if the `options.dest` property is not provided, but the `options.url` property is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This code fragment is the same as the original, and it will not cause any changes in the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is not a valid URL')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the error message to indicate that the `options.url` property is not a valid URL. This could cause the test to fail if the `options.url` property is not a valid URL, but the `options.dest` property is.
