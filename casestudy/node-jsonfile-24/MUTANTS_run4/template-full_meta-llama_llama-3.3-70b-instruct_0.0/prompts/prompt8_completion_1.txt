Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.toString(), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable, which could potentially return a different value if `data` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is always set to `null`, regardless of the value of `options.reviver`, which could affect how the JSON data is parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slice(1), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method is called on the `data` variable, which would remove the first character of the string, potentially causing the JSON parsing to fail or return incorrect results.

DONE.
