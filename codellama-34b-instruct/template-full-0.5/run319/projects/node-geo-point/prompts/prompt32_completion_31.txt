  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude - point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `point1.longitude` and `point2.longitude` as arguments to the `deg2rad` function, while this replacement uses the difference between the two longitudes as the argument. This could cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by a certain amount, depending on the specific values of the longitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point1.longitude - point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deg2rad` to convert the longitude difference to radians, while this replacement uses `rad2deg` to convert the longitude difference to degrees. This could cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by a certain amount, depending on the specific values of the longitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
