  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(null, this, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` allows to call a function with a specified context and arguments, but here it is called with `null` as the context, which would make `this` refer to the global object in non-strict mode, not the object being checked for the property, thereby affecting the validity of the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.apply(prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` allows to call a function with a specified context and arguments, but here it is called with `prop` as the context, which would make `this` refer to the property itself, not the object being checked for the property, thereby affecting the validity of the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.hasOwn(this, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `
