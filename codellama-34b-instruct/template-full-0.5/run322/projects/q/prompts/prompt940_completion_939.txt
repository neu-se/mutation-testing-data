  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument passed to the function, which is the `this` binding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments passed to the function, which are the `this` binding and the `name` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first three arguments passed to the function, which are the `this` binding, the `name` argument, and the `args` argument.

DONE.
