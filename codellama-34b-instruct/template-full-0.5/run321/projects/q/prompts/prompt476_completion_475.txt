  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `splice()` removes a specific element at a given index. If the unhandled rejection array has more than one element, `pop()` would remove a different element than the one that was intended to be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `splice()` removes a specific element at a given index. If the unhandled rejection array has more than one element, `shift()` would remove a different element than the one that was intended to be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely clears the unhandled rejection array, whereas `splice()` only removes a specific element. If
