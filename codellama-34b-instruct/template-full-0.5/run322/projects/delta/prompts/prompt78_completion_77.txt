  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        lastOp.delete === newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only merge delete operations if they have the same value, while the original code merges all delete operations regardless of their value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        lastOp.delete !== newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge delete operations only if they have different values, while the original code merges all delete operations regardless of their value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        lastOp.delete > newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge delete operations only if the last operation has a greater value than the new operation, while the original code merges all delete operations regardless of their value.

DONE.
