  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function without the `-1` term, which is a significant part of the `expm1` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function without the `-a` term, which is a significant part of the `expm1` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function without the `-b` term, which is a significant part of the `expm1` function.

DONE.
