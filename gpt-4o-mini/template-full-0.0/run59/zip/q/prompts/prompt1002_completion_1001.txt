Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from "post" to "get", which may not be supported by the object and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a method named "dispatch" instead of "post", which may not exist on the object, leading to a failure in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the intended operation from "post" to "send", which may have a different implementation and could alter the expected outcome of the function.

DONE.
