Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the function to proceed if the type is 'Point', rather than throwing an error when it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for the lowercase 'point', allowing the function to accept 'Point' (with an uppercase 'P') as valid, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an error if the type property is completely absent, rather than checking if it is specifically equal to 'Point', thus allowing any other value to pass through without error.

DONE.
