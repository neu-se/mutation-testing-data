  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = /* void */
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to `0`, while the new code fragment sets it to `undefined`. This could cause issues in the code that uses the `z` object, particularly if it relies on the value of `z['im']` being a number.
