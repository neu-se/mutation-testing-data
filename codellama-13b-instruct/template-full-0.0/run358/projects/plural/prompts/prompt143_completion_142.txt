  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function is called with the `rule[0]` argument, which is a regular expression object, instead of the `word` argument, which is a string. This would cause the `type` function to return the type of the regular expression object instead of the type of the string, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` argument is used directly instead of being passed to the `type` function. This would cause the `rule[0]` argument to be used as the type of the string, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` argument is used directly instead of being passed to the `type` function. This would cause the `rule[1]` argument
