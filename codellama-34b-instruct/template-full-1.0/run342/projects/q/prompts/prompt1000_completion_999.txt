  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `deferred.reject`, which is a function that was defined earlier in the code. However, by adding `()`, we are actually calling the function, which would result in the promise being rejected, even if there were no errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `deferred.reject`, which is a function that was defined earlier in the code. By changing the function to `deferred.resolve()`, we are effectively resolving the promise before it is even returned, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `deferred.reject`, which is a function that was defined earlier in the code. By replacing it with `null`, we are essentially removing the code that performs
