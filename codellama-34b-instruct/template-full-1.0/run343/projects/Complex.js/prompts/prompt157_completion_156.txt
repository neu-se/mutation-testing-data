  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code handled the case where the divisor is 0, but the new code would return 0 in that case, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code handled the case where the divisor is -1, but the new code would return -1 in that case, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code handled the case where the divisor is NaN, but the new code would return 0 in that case, which is incorrect.

DONE.
