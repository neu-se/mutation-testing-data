  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second-to-last op in the delta's ops array with the new op, instead of the last op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first op in the delta's ops array with the new op, instead of the last op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the last op in the delta's ops array with the first op, instead of the last op with the new op.

DONE.
