Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the transformation to use the `thisData` object instead of `otherData`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when merging operations, as it would ignore the intended data from the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing it with `null` would cause the transformation logic to fail when trying to access properties of `otherData`, leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior when handling embedded types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would cause the code to skip the transformation logic entirely, as it would not match any keys in the `thisData` object, resulting in the `delta.retain` call using an incorrect or default value instead of the intended transformation.

DONE.
