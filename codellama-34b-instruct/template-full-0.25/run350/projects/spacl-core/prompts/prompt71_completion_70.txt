  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `verb`, which would cause the `query` method to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator concatenates the value of `verb` with the string `'foo'`, which would cause the `query` method to return a different result than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method converts the value of `verb` to uppercase, which would cause the `query` method to return a different result than it should.

DONE.
