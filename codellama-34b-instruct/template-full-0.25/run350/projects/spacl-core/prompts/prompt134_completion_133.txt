  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in this.verbs) {
  rule.verbs[verb] = this.verbs[verb];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `this.verbs` object, rather than the `verb` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of this.verbs) {
  rule.verbs[verb] = this.verbs[verb];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the values of the `this.verbs` object, rather than the properties.
