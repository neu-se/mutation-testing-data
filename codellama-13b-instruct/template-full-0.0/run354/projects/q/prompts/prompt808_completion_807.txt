  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called with the `object` argument, which is a promise for an array of promises. This would cause the `Q` function to return a promise for the resolution of the array of promises, rather than the original promise for the array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `object` promise, which is a promise for an array of promises. This would cause the `then` method to return a promise for the resolution of the array of promises, rather than the original promise for the array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` method is called on the `Q` object, which is a promise for an array of promises. This would
