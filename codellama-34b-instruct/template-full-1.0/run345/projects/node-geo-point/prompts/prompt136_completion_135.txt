  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds a number down to the nearest integer, which could cause the adjusted latitude and longitude values to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round()` rounds a number to the nearest integer, which could cause the adjusted latitude and longitude values to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` rounds a number up to the nearest integer, which could cause the adjusted latitude and longitude values to be incorrect.

DONE.
