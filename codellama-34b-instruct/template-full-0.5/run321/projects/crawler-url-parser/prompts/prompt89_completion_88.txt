  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the text of the current element, while this new code fragment returns the text of all anchor elements within the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prev().text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the text of the current element, while this new code fragment returns the text of the previous element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).closest('a').text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the text of the current element, while this new code fragment returns the text of the closest ancestor anchor element.

DONE.
