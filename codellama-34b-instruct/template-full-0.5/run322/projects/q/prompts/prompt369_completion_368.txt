  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the `exception` object, while this new code fragment throws a new `Error` object with the message "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the `exception` object, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with the `exception` object as the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the `exception` object, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with a new `Error` object as the rejection reason, and the `Error` object's message is set to the message of the original `exception` object.

DONE.
