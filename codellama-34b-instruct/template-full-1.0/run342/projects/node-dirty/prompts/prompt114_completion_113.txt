  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'loaded'` instead of `'load'`, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'flush'` instead of `'load'`, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'drain'` instead of `'load'`, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

DONE.
