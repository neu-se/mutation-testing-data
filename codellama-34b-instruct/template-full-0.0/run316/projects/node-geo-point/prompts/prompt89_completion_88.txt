  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to compute the cosine of the difference in longitude, while this replacement uses the `sin` function to compute the sine of the difference in longitude. This would cause the resulting `x` value to be different, which would in turn affect the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sin(φ2) - cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to compute the sine of the difference in longitude, while this replacement uses the `cos` function to compute the cosine of the difference in longitude. This would cause the resulting `x` value to be different, which would in turn affect the calculation of the bearing.
