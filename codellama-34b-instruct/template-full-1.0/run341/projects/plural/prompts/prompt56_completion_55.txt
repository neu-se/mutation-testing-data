  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'otherword'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word "otherword" instead of the expected "ves".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'es' + 'otherword'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "esotherword" instead of the expected "ves".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return an empty string instead of the expected "ves".

DONE.
