  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by all elements of `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` would remove and return the last element of `args`, whereas `concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by all elements of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` would remove and return the first element of `args`, whereas `concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by all elements of `args`.

DONE.
