  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` is null.

DONE.
