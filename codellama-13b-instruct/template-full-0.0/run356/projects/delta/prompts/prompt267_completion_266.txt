  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire `otherOp` object to the `retDelta` array, rather than just the `insert` property. This could cause the `retDelta` array to contain unexpected values, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push only the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object to the `retDelta` array. This could cause the `retDelta` array to contain only the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp.insert.slice(0, 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push only the first character of the `
