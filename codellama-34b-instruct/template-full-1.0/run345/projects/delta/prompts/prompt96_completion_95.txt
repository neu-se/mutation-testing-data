  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` expects a non-negative index. Using `-1` as the index would cause the method to insert the new element at the end of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` expects a non-negative index. Using `this.ops.length - 1` would cause the method to insert the new element at the end of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` expects a non-negative index. Using `this.ops.length` would cause the method to insert the new element at the end of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
