  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `opLength` would be incremented by one, potentially causing the incorrect behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `opLength` would be decremented by one, potentially causing the incorrect behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `opLength` would be multiplied by two, potentially causing the incorrect behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
