  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext()` calls the function and returns the boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next element in the iteration, while `otherIter.next()` calls the function and returns the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` is a function that returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, while `otherIter.peek()` calls the function and returns the next element.

DONE.
