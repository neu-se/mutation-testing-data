  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in the wrong order, causing the method to be called with incorrect parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument would be passed to the method, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument would be passed to the method, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
