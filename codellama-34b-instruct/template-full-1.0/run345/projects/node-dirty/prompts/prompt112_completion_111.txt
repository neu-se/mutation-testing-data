  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the buffer would be sliced to remove the first character, which would likely cause the error message to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${null}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the null value would likely cause a different error message to be generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${undefined}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the undefined value would likely cause a different error message to be generated.

DONE.
