  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['ones']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ones` method is not defined, so it would return `null` instead of the actual value of the `acos` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['sin']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` method is not defined, so it would return `null` instead of the actual value of the `acos` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acosh']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acosh` method is not defined, so it would return `null` instead of the actual value of the `acos` method.

DONE.
