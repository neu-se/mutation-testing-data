 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"call", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method passes the `this` value as the first argument to the target function, while the `call` method sets the `this` value explicitly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [1, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `apply` method is used as the `this` value for the target function, and changing it from `void 0` (undefined) to `1` would alter the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"spread", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is not a valid method for applying arguments in JavaScript. The `apply` method would be expected, and changing it would introduce an error.

DONE.
