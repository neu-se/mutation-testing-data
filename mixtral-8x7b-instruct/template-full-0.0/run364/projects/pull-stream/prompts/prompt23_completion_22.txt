 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the original `ref` array by removing the first element, whereas the original code stores the first element in a variable `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes and returns the last element of the `ref` array, whereas the original code accesses the first element `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new array containing all elements of `ref` except the first one, whereas the original code accesses the first element `ref[0]`.

DONE.
