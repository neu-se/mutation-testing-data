  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.retain == null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is `null` or `undefined`, while this new code fragment only checks if it's `null`. If `thisOp.retain` is `undefined`, the original code would execute the `else` block, but this new code would skip it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.retain === 'insert') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is `null` or `undefined`, while this new code fragment only checks if it's `'insert'`. If `thisOp.retain` is any other value, the original code would execute the `else` block, but this new code would skip it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof thisOp.retain === 'string') {
