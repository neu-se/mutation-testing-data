  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the dereference of the `ops` property, which is needed to access the array of operations. Instead, it would return the object itself, which would likely cause errors when the code attempts to manipulate the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `op` property of the `ops` array, which is not present in the original code. This would cause an error when the code attempts to access the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `length` property of the `ops.ops` array, which is not present in the original code. This would cause an error when the code attempts to access the property.

DONE.
