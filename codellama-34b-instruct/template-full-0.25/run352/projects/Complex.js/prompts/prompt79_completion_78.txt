  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === '-'` would cause the parser to treat the `-` symbol as a valid separator, even if it is not surrounded by whitespace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === '*'` would cause the parser to treat the `*` symbol as a valid separator, even if it is not surrounded by
