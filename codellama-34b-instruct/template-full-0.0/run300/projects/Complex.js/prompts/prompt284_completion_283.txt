  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `a` and potentially cause the `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` functions to return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `a` and potentially cause the `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` functions to return different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `a` and potentially cause the `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` functions to return different values.

DONE.
