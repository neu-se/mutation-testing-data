  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `ends.promise.get` is a method that retrieves the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.then` is a method that executes the provided callback function when the promise is resolved, whereas `ends.promise.get` is a method that retrieves the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `ends.promise.get` is a method that retrieves the value of the promise.

DONE.
