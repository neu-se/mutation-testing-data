  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to divide by zero, which would throw an error and cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to divide by a negative number, which would result in a complex number with a different magnitude and phase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
20
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to divide by a greater number, which would result in a more magnified complex number.

DONE.
