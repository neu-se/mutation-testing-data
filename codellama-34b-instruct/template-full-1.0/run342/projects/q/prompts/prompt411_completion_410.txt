  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "fulfilled") {
    return inspected.value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returned `inspected.value` if `inspected.state` was "fulfilled". By removing the if statement, the function would always return `inspected.value`, regardless of the value of `inspected.state`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "rejected") {
    return inspected.reason;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only return `inspected.reason` if `inspected.state` was "rejected". By removing the if statement, the function would always return `inspected.reason`, regardless of the value of `inspected.state`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "pending") {
    return undefined;
}
