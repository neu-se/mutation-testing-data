  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.peekLength(0) > Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the operation at the current index, minus the current offset. If the offset is 0, this will always return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.peekType('retain') < Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the operation at the current index as a string. If the type is 'retain', the method will return a negative infinity, which will always be less than `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !this.hasNext();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more operations to be processed. If there are no more operations, this method will return `true`.

DONE.
