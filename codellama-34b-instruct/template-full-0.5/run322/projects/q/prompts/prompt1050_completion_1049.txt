  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `ends.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve` would resolve the `closed` promise, whereas `ends.resolve` would resolve the `ends` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(error)` would reject the promise with the specified error, whereas `ends.resolve` would resolve the promise.

DONE.
