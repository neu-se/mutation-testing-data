  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` event is emitted when the `writeStream` is ready to accept more data, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when the `writeStream` has been drained of all data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_close` event is emitted when the `readStream` is closed, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when the `writeStream` has been drained of all data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'reflush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reflush` event is not a valid event for a `WriteStream`, whereas the `drain` event is valid and is emitted when the `writeStream` has been drained of all data.

DONE.
