  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the link URL has one more part than the page URL, while this replacement checks if the link URL has the same number of parts as the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the link URL has one more part than the page URL, while this replacement checks if the link URL has more than one more part than the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the link URL has one more part than the page URL, while this replacement checks if the link URL has less than one more part than the page URL.

DONE.
