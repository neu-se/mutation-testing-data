  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same array as the original code, but with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same array as the original code, but with the last element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reversed array of the original code.

DONE.
