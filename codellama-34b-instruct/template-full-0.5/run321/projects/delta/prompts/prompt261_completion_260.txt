  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `diff` method on the `AttributeMap` class to compare the attributes of the two operations, rather than simply comparing the attributes directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the two operations directly, rather than using the `diff` method on the `AttributeMap` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(otherOp.attributes, thisOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the two operations in the opposite direction, using the `diff` method on the `AttributeMap` class.

DONE.
