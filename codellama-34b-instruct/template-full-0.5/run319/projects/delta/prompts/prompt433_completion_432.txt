  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return `false` even if there are still more operations to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return `true` even if there are no more operations to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return `true` even if there are no more operations to be processed.

DONE.
