Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an empty array instead of a non-empty one, which would cause the code to skip pushing the first operation from `other` when it should have been included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a less than comparison, which is logically equivalent to checking for an empty array but may lead to confusion and potential errors in understanding the intent of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires `other.ops` to have more than one operation to execute the push, which could lead to missing out on a valid operation if `other.ops` contains exactly one operation.

DONE.
