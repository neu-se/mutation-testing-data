  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` returns a string and `exception` returns an object, which would trigger a different behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
new Error("message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error("message")` creates a new error object and would trigger a different behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is the JavaScript equivalent of undefined and would trigger a different behavior in the code.

DONE.
