  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set only when long stack support is disabled and the `hasStacks` variable is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `promise.stack` property to be set when long stack support is enabled or when the `hasStacks` variable is truthy, regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `promise.stack` property to be set when long stack support is disabled or when the `hasStacks` variable is truthy, regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.
