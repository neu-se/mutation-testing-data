  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only references the `abortCb` function, while this new code fragment actually calls the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only references the `abortCb` function, while this new code fragment actually calls the function using the `call()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only references the `abortCb` function, while this new code fragment actually calls the function using the `apply()` method.

DONE.
