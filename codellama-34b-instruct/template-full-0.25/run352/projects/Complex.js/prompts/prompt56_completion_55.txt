  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` is the absolute value of `a`, while `a['arg']` is the argument of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `b['arg']` is the argument of `b`, while `a['arg']` is the argument of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is the sum of `a` and `b`, while `a['arg']` is the argument of `a`.

DONE.
