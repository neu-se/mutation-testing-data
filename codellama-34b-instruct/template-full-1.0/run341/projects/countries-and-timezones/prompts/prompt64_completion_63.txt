  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error("Test mutation"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a function that returns `undefined`, while the mutated code would throw an error as soon as it is called. This would cause any tests that rely on the `getCountry` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a function that returns a country object, while the mutated code would return a number. This would cause any tests that rely on the `getCountry` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => "fail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a function that returns a country object, while the mutated code would return a string. This would cause any tests that rely on the `getCountry` function to fail.

DONE.
