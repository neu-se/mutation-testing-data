  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would evaluate to true if `c` is a plus sign, while the new code fragment would evaluate to false if `c` is a plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== ' '-'+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would evaluate to true if `c` is a minus sign or plus sign, while the new code fragment would evaluate to false if `c` is a minus sign or plus sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== ' *'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would evaluate to true if `c` is an asterisk, while the new code fragment would evaluate to false if `c` is an asterisk.

DONE.
