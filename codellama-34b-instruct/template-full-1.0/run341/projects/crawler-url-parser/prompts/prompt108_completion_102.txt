  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl` is used to construct the `ret` object, and replacing it with `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl` is used to construct the `ret` object, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl` is used to construct the `ret` object, and replacing it with `0` would cause an error.

DONE.
