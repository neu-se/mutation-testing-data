  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    throw err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment throws an error regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment returns the error as a value instead of throwing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return Q.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with the error as the reason.

DONE.
