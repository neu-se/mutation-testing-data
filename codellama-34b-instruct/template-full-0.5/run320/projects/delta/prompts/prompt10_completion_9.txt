  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `b` regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of `a` and `b`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the product of `a` and `b`, regardless of the value of `a`.

DONE.
