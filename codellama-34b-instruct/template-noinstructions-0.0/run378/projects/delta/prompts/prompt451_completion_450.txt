  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of `hasNext()`, which would cause the `if` statement to execute if there are no more elements in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property of the iterator is used to keep track of the current position in the array, and the `ops.length` property is used to determine the length of the array. The `if` statement would execute if the current position is less than the length of the array, which would cause the iterator to continue iterating over the array even if there are no more elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior
