  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.unshift` would add the task to the beginning of the queue instead of the end, which could cause the task to be executed earlier than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.pop` would remove the last task from the queue instead of adding a new task, which could cause the queue to be emptied unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.shift` would remove the first task from the queue instead of adding a new task, which could cause the queue to be emptied unexpectedly.

DONE.
