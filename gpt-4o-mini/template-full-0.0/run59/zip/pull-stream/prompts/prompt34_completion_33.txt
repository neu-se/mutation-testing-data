Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument being passed to the `pull` function from the first element of the `ref` array to the third element, which may not exist or may have a different value, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as an argument to the `pull` function will not provide a valid input, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly or throw an error when it tries to access properties of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument will change the expected input type, which may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the function attempts to operate on `null` as if it were a valid argument.

DONE.
