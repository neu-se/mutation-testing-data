  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```acos(-r)```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 for r > 1, while this new code fragment would return -1 for r > 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```acos(1-r)```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 for r = 1, while this new code fragment would return 0 for r = 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```acos(r/2)```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 for r = 2, while this new code fragment would return 0.5 for r = 2.

DONE.
