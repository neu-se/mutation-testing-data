  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This will cause the `emit` method to be called with the `'error'` event instead of the `'drain'` event, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This will cause the `emit` method to be called with the `'close'` event instead of the `'drain'` event, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This will cause the `emit` method to be called with the `'end'` event instead of the `'drain'` event, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

DONE.
