  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onUnhandledError, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onUnhandledError, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called twice, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
