  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the reference to the array of promises with `undefined`, causing an error when trying to access the `length` property of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the reference to the array of promises with the number `0`, causing the `reduce` function to stop immediately and return `0` as the final value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the reference to the array of promises with `null`, causing the `reduce` function to stop immediately and return `null` as the final value.

DONE.
