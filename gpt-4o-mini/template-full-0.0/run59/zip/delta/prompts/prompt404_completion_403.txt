Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the transformation to use the data from `thisData` instead of `otherData`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when merging operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the transformation to ignore the `otherData` entirely, which could lead to unexpected results when retaining or inserting operations, as no data would be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the object `otherData` with a numeric value representing the length, which would not correctly represent the intended data structure and could lead to incorrect transformations of the operations.

DONE.
