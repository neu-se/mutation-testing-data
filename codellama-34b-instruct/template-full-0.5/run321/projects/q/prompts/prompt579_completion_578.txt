  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.throw` is a different function than `continuer.bind`, and it would cause the generator to throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.next` is a different function than `continuer.bind`, and it would cause the generator to move to the next iteration instead of returning a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.value` is a different property than `continuer.bind`, and it would cause the generator to return the current value of the iteration instead of the bound function.

DONE.
