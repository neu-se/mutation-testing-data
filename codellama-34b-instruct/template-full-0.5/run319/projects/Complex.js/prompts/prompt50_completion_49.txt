  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` property is the argument of the complex number, while the `abs` property is the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, while the `abs` property is the absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the `abs` property is the absolute value.

DONE.
