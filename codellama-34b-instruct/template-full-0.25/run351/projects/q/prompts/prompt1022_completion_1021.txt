  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `dispatch` method is expected to be a function, but `1` is not a function, so it would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `dispatch` method is expected to be a function, but `function() {}` is not the same function as the original `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line, so it would cause a different function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `dispatch` method is expected to be a function, but `null` is not a function, so it would cause a type error.
