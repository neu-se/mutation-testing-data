  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append a slash to the destination path, even if the input URL does not have a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the directory name from the destination path, rather than the filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`foo/${decodeURIComponent(pathname)}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend the filename with the string "foo/" before decoding it, rather than just decoding the filename.

DONE.
