  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between the current `GeoPoint` and the `point` parameter, whereas the modified code calculates the distance between the `point` parameter and the current `GeoPoint`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between the current `GeoPoint` and the `point` parameter in latitude and longitude, whereas the modified code calculates the sum of the longitudes of the current `GeoPoint` and the `point` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between the current `GeoPoint` and the `point` parameter in latitude and longitude, whereas the modified code calculates the product of the longitudes of the current `Ge
