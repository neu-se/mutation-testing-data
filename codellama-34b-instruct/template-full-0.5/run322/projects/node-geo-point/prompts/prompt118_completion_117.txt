  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, but adding 1 to the distance would result in an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, but multiplying the distance by 2 would result in an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, but subtracting 1 from the distance would result in an incorrect value.

DONE.
