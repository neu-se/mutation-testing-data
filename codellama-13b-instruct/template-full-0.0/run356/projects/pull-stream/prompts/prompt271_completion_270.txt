  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(x => x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` array is being mapped to a new array with each element incremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(x => x > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` array is being filtered to only include elements that are greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` array is being reduced to a single value by summing up all the elements.

DONE.
