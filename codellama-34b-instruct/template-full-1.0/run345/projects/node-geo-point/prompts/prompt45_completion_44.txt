  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `r > 1 ? 1 : r`, which is a ternary expression that returns `1` if `r` is greater than `1`, and `r` otherwise. In this option, we simply return `r`, which means that the function would always return a value greater than or equal to `1`, even if `r` is less than `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1-r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `r > 1 ? 1 : r`, which is a ternary expression that returns `1` if `r` is greater than `1`, and `r` otherwise. In this option, we subtract `1` from `r`, which means that the function would always return a value less than or equal to `1`, even if `r` is greater than `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
