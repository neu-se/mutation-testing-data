  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while the replacement code checks if it is not a number. This change would cause the code to produce different results for operations where the `delete` property is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete + 1 === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while the replacement code checks if `nextOp.delete + 1` is a number. This change would cause the code to produce different results for operations where the `delete` property is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete && nextOp.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while the replacement code checks
