  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call, but the replacement code fragment `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` is a function call with arguments, which would change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call with three arguments, but the replacement code fragment `abortCb(cb, abort)` is a function call with only two arguments, which would change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call with three arguments, but the replacement code fragment `abortC
