  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes === baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, while the original code used the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes != baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, while the original code used the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes !== baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the original code used the `===` operator, which checks for equality.

DONE.
