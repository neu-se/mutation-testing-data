  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called, which advances the iterator to the next element, whereas the original code fragment only accessed the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next element without advancing the iterator, whereas the original code fragment used `next()` to advance the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with an argument of `length + 1`, which advances the iterator by more than one element.

DONE.
