  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, <promise>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what the expected behavior of the `trackRejection` function is when it is called with a `promise` argument that is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(<promise>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method is not defined on the `unhandledRejections` array, and it is not clear what the expected behavior of the `trackRejection` function is when it is called with a `promise` argument that is not a string or a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<promise>.indexOf(unhandledRejections);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method is not defined on the
