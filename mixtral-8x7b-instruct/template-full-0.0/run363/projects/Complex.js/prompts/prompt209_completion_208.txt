 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated argument would be incorrect, causing the final result to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the imaginary part of the current complex number as the argument, even when the real part is not zero, causing the final result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(b, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different formula to calculate the argument, which may not be accurate for all cases, causing the final result to be different.

DONE.
