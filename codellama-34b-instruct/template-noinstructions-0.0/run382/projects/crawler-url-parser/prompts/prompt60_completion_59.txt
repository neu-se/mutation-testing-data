  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with different properties, which could affect the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with different properties, which could affect the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with different properties, which could affect the rest of the code.

DONE.
