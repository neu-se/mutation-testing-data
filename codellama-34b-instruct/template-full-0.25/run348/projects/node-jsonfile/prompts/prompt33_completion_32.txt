  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function. Using `fs.writeFileSync` would cause the code to block until the file is written, which could lead to performance issues and unresponsive behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(null, file))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(null, file)` is a bound function that is called with the `file` argument, whereas `fs.writeFile` is called without any arguments. Using a bound function could cause the code to behave differently, especially if the `file` argument is used in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(null, file, str
