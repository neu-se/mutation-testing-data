  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `.fail()` method, causing the promise chain to reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { throw new Error("error"); }, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown, but the error would not be caught by the `.fail()` method, causing the promise chain to remain pending indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(reject, resolve) { reject("error"); }, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message "error", which would cause the promise chain to be rejected.

DONE.
