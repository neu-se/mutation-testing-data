  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `1`, which is different from the original code fragment where the value is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `-1`, which is different from the original code fragment where the value is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `null`, which is different from the original code fragment where the value is `0`.

DONE.
