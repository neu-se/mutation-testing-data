  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(["new illness"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new element to the `illnesses` array, which would not be present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `illnesses` array, which would not be present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.filter(function(illness) { return illness !== "rabie" })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element `"rabie"` from the `illnesses` array, which would not be present in the original code.

DONE.
