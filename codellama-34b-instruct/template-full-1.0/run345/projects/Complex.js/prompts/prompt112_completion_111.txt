  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number `z`, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number `z`, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the imaginary part of the complex number `z`, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
