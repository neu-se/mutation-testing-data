  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not iterate over the last line of the document, as the `index` variable would be initialized to 0 instead of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would iterate over the last line of the document, but the `predicate` function would not be called for the last line, as the `index` variable would be -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would iterate over the last line of the document, and the `predicate` function would be called for the last line, but the `index` variable would be 2, which would cause the `predicate` function to be called with an incorrect index value.

DONE.
