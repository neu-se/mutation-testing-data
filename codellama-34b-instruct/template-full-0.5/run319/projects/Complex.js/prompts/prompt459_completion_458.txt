  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] === Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to negative infinity.

DONE.
