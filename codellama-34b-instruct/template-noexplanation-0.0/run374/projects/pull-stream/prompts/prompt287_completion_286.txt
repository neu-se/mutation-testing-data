  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.

DONE.
