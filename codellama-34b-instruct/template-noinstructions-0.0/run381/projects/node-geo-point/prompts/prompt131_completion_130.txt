  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would return a different tile coordinate for the same geographic location, which could cause issues in applications that rely on tile-based rendering or spatial indexing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would return a different tile coordinate for the same geographic location, which could cause issues in applications that rely on tile-based rendering or spatial indexing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(zoom / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would return a different tile coordinate for the same geographic location, which could cause issues in applications that rely on tile-based rendering or spatial indexing.

DONE.
