  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number before checking if it is finite, which would change the result of the `isFinite` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number before checking if it is finite, which would change the result of the `isFinite` method.

DONE.
