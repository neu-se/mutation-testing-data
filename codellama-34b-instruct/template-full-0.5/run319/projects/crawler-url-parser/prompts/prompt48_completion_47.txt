  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different `URL` object, with different properties and values, which could affect the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different `URL` object, with different properties and values, which could affect the rest of the code.
