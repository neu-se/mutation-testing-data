 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` method invokes the function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` uses an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.constructor.prototype.methodName
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a non-existent `methodName` property of the constructor prototype, rather than the intended method of the `callback` function.

DONE.
