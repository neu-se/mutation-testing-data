 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would not be passed to `Q.denodeify.apply()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because if the code is running in a browser environment, `window` would be passed as the `this` value instead of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return this; }()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that returns the current `this` value, and immediately invoke it. This could potentially change the value of `this` depending on the context in which the code is running.

DONE.
