  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject(null)` is different from `reject(reason)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject(undefined)` is different from `reject(reason)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject(0)` is different from `reject(reason)`.

DONE.
