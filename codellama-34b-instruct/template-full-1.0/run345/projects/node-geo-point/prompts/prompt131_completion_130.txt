  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will cause the value of `zoom` to be inverted, potentially resulting in a different `tile` value being returned by the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `zoom` will be reduced by 1, potentially resulting in a different `tile` value being returned by the `toTile` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method will throw an error when it tries to access the `zoom` property of `undefined`.

DONE.
