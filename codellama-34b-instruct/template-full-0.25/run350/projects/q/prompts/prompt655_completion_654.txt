  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of the `object` promise, which would likely result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `undefined` instead of the `object` promise, which would likely result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () { return object; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `object` promise, which would return a new promise that resolves to the value of `object`. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the resolved value of `object` instead of the original promise, which could potentially result in different behavior.

DONE.
