  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.href` is the full URL, including the protocol and hostname, whereas `currentUrl.url` is the pathname and query string only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol + "//" + currentUrl.host + currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the protocol and hostname, whereas `currentUrl.url` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.pathname + currentUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the pathname and query string only, whereas `currentUrl.url` includes the protocol and hostname as well.

DONE.
