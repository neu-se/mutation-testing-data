  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, which may not be the same as the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `attributes` property of the `baseOp` object, which may not be the same as the `attributes` property of the `thisOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `retain` property of the `baseOp` object, which may not be the same as the `retain` property of the `thisOp` object.

DONE.
