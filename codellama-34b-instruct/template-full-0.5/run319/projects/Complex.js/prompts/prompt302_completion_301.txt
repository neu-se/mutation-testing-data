  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the negative of the original `b` value, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the original `b` value, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be doubling the original `b` value, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

DONE.
