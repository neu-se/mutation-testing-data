Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `reviver` function from the `options` object, even if `options` is `null` or `undefined`, potentially causing a TypeError if `options.reviver` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never use a `reviver` function, even if one is provided in the `options` object, potentially changing the way the JSON data is parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options && options.reviver && options.reviver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not only check if `options` and `options.reviver` exist, but also immediately invoke the `reviver` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors if the `reviver` function is not designed to be called at that point.

DONE.
