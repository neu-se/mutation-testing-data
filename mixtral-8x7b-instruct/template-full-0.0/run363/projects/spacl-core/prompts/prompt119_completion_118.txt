 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'/placeholder'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path string to a fixed string, which would not match any dynamic paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.regex.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the source of the regex, which may not match the actual path if the regex has capturing groups or other advanced features.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<uninitialized variable>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a reference error, as the variable is not initialized before being used.

DONE.
