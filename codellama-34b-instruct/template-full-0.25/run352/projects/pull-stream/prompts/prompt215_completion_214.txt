  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would call the `cb` function with the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` would call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` error, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would call the `cb` function with the `aborted` error and the `data` value, while the new code fragment `cb(aborted, data)` would call the `cb` function with the `aborted` error and the `data` value, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
