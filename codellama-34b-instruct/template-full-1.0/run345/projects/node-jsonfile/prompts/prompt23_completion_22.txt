  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom(await fs.readFile(file, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is called on the result of `fs.readFile`, which is a promise, while in the original code it is called on the `data` variable which is the result of `fs.readFile` after it has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom(fs.readFileSync(file, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is called on the result of `fs.readFileSync`, which is the raw file content, while in the original code it is called on the `data` variable which is the parsed JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(stripBom(await fs.readFile(file, options)))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is called on the result of `stripBom`, which
