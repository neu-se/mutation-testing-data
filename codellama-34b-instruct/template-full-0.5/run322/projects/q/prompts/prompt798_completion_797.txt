  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method would introduce a delay of 1 second before the promise is resolved, which would cause the `then` method to be called after 1 second instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, which would cause the `then` method to be called with the error instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value (42), which would cause the `then` method to be called with the value instead of the resolved promise.

DONE.
