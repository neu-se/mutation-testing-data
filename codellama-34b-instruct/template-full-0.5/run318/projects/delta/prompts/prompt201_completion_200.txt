  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object. However, the suggested code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `rest` object, which is a `Delta` object that represents the remaining ops in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object. However, the suggested code fragment calls the `slice` method on the `rest` object, which is a `Delta` object that represents the remaining ops in the iterator. The `slice` method returns a new `Delta` object that contains the first `n` ops in the iterator, where `n` is the first argument passed to `slice`.

Option 3:
