  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was adding a rule for the word "bacterium" to be pluralized as "bacteria", but the new code fragment is adding a rule for the word "bacterium" to be pluralized as "bacteria" again, which is not necessary and could cause an infinite loop.

DONE.
