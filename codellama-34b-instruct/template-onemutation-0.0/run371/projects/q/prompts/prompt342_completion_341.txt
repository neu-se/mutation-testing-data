  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the result of `_fulfilled(value)`, which is a promise that is resolved with the value returned by `_fulfilled`. In the original code, the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the value returned by `_fulfilled` directly, without wrapping it in a promise.

DONE.
