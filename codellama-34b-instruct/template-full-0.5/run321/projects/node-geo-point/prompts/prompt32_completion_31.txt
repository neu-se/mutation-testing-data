  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would return a different value, causing the `r` variable to have a different value, which would affect the calculation of the distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would return a different value, causing the `r` variable to have a different value, which would affect the calculation of the distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function would return a different value, causing the `r` variable to have a different value, which would affect the calculation of the distance.

DONE.
