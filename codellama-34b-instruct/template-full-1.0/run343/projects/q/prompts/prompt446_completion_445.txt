  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(0, 0, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the promise to the beginning of the array instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the array instead of adding a new element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
unhandledReasons.unshift(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the reason to the beginning of the array instead of the end.

DONE.
