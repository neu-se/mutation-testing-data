  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `seen` check, causing the `filter` function to return `true` for items that have already been seen, rather than filtering them out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `seen` property is set to `true`, rather than checking if it is set to any truthy value. This would cause the `filter` function to return `true` for items that have not been seen, rather than filtering them out.
