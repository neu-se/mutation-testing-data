Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines are acceptable in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because it suggests that empty lines do not indicate an error, which contradicts the original intent of signaling a problem with the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Corrupted row detected')
```
This would result in different behavior because it generalizes the error message, potentially obscuring the specific issue of empty lines, which may lead to confusion about the nature of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Invalid row format')
```
This would result in different behavior because it implies that the error is due to a format issue rather than specifically addressing the presence of an empty line, thus changing the focus of the error handling.

DONE.
