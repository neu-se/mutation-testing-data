Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using the tangent function instead of the sine function will change the calculation of the x component in the bearing formula, leading to incorrect bearing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because using the sine of φ2 instead of φ1 will incorrectly calculate the x component, which will affect the bearing calculation and yield an incorrect angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the sine of φ1 will distort the calculation of the x component, leading to an incorrect bearing value that does not accurately reflect the angle between the two points.

DONE.
