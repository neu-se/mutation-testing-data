  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `sink.abort` function, while the new code fragment calls the function immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `sink.abort` function, while the new code fragment passes the argument `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `sink.abort` function, while the new code fragment passes the argument `false`.

DONE.
