  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, which would cause the `plural` function to fail when it tries to access the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `undefined`, which would cause the `plural` function to fail when it tries to access the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.bind(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `1`, which would cause the `plural` function to fail when it tries to access the `rules` array.

DONE.
