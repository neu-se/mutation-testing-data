  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the extension of a path, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.relative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.relative` returns the relative path from one absolute path to another, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

DONE.
