  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the value instead of the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to the original value plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would post a message using the key and value.

DONE.
