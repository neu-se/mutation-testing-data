  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `1` would cause the `match` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `"foo"` would cause the `match` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, ctx.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `ctx.bar` would cause the `match` method to return a different result.

DONE.
