Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'
module.exports = function infinite (generate) {
  generate = generate || Math.random
  return function (end, cb) {
    if(<PLACEHOLDER>) return cb && cb(end)
    return cb(null, generate())
  }
}



```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
