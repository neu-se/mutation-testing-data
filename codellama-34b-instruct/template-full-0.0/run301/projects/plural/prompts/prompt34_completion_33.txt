  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the last character, but replacing it with 1 would always return the first character of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the last character, but replacing it with -1 would always return the last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the last character, but replacing it with `word.length - 1` would always return the last character of the word.

DONE.
