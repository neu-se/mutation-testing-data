  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("reject", [new Error("Something went wrong")]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error message, even if the original code would have resolved the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("resolve", [null]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, even if the original code would have rejected the promise with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, [1, 2, 3]]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an array of numbers, even if the original code would have rejected the promise with an error.

DONE.
