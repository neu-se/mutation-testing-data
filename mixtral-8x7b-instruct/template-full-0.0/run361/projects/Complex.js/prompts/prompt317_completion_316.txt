 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` calculates the hyperbolic sine of a number, while the original `sinh` is a property of the `Complex` object that calculates the hyperbolic sine of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator negates the result of the `sinh` function, which would change the sign of the imaginary part of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of a number, while the original `sinh` is a property of the `Complex` object that calculates the hyperbolic sine of a complex number.

DONE.
