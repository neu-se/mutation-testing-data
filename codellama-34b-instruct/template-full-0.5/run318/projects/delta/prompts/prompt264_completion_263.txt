  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes || otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `otherOp.attributes` if `thisOp.attributes` is null or undefined, which could lead to unexpected results if `otherOp.attributes` is also null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes && otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if either `thisOp.attributes` or `otherOp.attributes` is null or undefined, which could lead to unexpected results if either of the two attributes is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes ?? otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `otherOp.attributes` if `thisOp.attributes` is null or undefined, which could lead to unexpected results if `otherOp.attributes` is also null or undefined.

DONE.
