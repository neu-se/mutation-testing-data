  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the `data` variable, while this new code fragment returns the `data` variable plus 1. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the exact value of `data` being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the `data` variable, while this new code fragment returns the `data` variable multiplied by 2. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the exact value of `data` being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the `data` variable, while this new code fragment returns the length of the `data` variable. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the exact value of `
