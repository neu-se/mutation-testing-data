 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
''.concat(spec,'/').split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra '/' at the beginning of the parts array, which could lead to unexpected matching results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a regular expression to split the spec string, which could lead to different array elements compared to the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.split('/').slice(1)
