Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Write operation failed')
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a new error with a fixed message instead of the original error, potentially obscuring the actual issue that occurred during the write operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning', err
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'warning' event instead of an 'error' event, which may lead to the error being ignored or not handled properly by listeners expecting an 'error' event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an error event with a null value instead of the actual error object, which could lead to confusion and improper handling of the error by the event listeners.

DONE.
