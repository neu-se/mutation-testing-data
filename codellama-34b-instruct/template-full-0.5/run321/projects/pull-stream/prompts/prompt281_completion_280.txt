  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because `!mapper` is the logical NOT operator, which flips the truthiness of the expression. In the original code, `mapper` is a function that is called with the argument `data`, but with `!mapper`, the function is not called and the expression evaluates to the opposite truthiness.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper()
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper()` is a function call, which would execute the function `mapper` and return its result. In the original code, `mapper` is a function that is called with the argument `data`, but with `mapper()`, the function is called without any arguments, which could result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the function `mapper`, but with `
