  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a primitive value, while void 0 is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a primitive value, while void 0 is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1
```
This would result in different behavior because void 1 is a different value than void 0.

DONE.
