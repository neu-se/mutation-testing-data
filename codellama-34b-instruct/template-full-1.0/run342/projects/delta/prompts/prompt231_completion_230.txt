  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon at the end of the line would be interpreted as a null statement, causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the Nan (not a number) value would be used in the operation, which would likely produce a result that is different from the original code's intent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative one value would be used in the operation, which would likely produce a result that is different from the original code's intent.

DONE.
