  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when `i > max`, while the mutated code fragment returns `false` in the same scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when `i > max`, while the mutated code fragment returns `null` in the same scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when `i > max`, while the mutated code fragment returns `true` when `i < max`.

DONE.
