 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a specific base URL instead of using the original `baseUrlStr` variable, which could lead to unexpected results in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the base URL entirely, which could cause issues when processing relative URLs in the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'https://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a specific protocol and domain, which could lead to unexpected results in certain scenarios.

By introducing these changes, you can test the robustness of the test suite and identify potential weaknesses in the code coverage. DONE.
