  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <rejected>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `void 0` to indicate that there is no third argument to `then`, while `return <rejected>` would pass the rejected value as the third argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `void 0` to indicate that there is no third argument to `then`, while `throw new Error("rejected")` would throw an error as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `void 0` to indicate that there is no third argument to `then`, while `return new Error("rejected")` would return an error object as the third argument.

DONE.
