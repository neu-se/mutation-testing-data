  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source !== 'function'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `read.source` is a function, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `read.source` is not an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'undefined'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `read.source` is defined, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
