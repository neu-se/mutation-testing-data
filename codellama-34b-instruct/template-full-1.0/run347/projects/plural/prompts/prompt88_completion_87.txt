  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment singularizes the word "person" to "people", while "persons" is already in the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'antelope'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment singularizes the word "antelope" to "antelopes", while the given code fragment would singularize it to "antelope".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'zebra'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment singularizes the word "zebras" to "zebra", while the given code fragment would singularize it to "zebras".

DONE.
