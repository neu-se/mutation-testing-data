  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` would be bound to the current context, which may not be the same as the context in which the `inspect` method was defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` would be called with the current context as the `this` value, which may not be the same as the context in which the `inspect` method was defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` would be applied with the current context as the `this` value, which may not be the same as the context in which the `inspect` method was defined.

DONE.
