  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a boolean value, unlike `end` which is a boolean primitive. This change would cause the `a` variable to be set to `true` when `null` is passed as the `end` argument, whereas in the original code, `a` would only be set to `true` when `end` is a truthy value (i.e., not `null` or `undefined`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a boolean value, unlike `end` which is a boolean primitive. This change would cause the `a` variable to be set to `true` when `undefined` is passed as the `end` argument, whereas in the original code, `a` would only be set to `true` when `end` is a truthy value (i.e., not `null` or `undefined`).
