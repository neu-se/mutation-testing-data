 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.insert && lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are truthy, instead of comparing them with `===`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with falsy values like `0` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
lastOp.hasOwnProperty('insert') && newOp.hasOwnProperty('insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp` and `lastOp` have an `insert` property, instead of checking if the values are equal. This would not prevent the code from working correctly, but it would not merge the `insert` properties when they have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.is(newOp.insert, lastOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.
