  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the new code fragment `null` is a constant value that is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the new code fragment `undefined` is a constant value that is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the new code fragment `acc` is a variable that is not a function and cannot be called.

DONE.
