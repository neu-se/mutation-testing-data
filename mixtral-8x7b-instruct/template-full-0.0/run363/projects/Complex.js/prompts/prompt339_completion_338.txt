 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 && b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the abstract equality operator (`==`) instead of the strict equality operator (`===`). This could lead to unexpected results if the values of `a` or `b` are of a type that can be coerced to 0, such as an empty string or an object with a `valueOf` method that returns 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b < Number.EPSILON
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a small positive value (`Number.EPSILON`) instead of checking for exact equality to 0. This could lead to the function returning a result for the case where `a` and `b` are both 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (a * a + b * b) === Infinity
