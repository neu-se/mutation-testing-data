 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * test.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a multiplication operation, which would change the output if the test.test value is not an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the test.test value to a string, which would change the output if the test.test value is not already a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test || 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a default value, which would change the output if the test.test value is falsy.

DONE.
