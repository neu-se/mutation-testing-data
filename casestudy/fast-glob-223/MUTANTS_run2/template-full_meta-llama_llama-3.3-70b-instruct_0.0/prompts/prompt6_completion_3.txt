Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern, { strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strict` option is set to `true` instead of `false`, which could lead to different glob matching results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.toUpperCase(), { strict: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pattern` is converted to uppercase before being passed to `isGlob`, which could lead to incorrect glob matching results if the original pattern contained lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern, { strict: false, nodir: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodir` option is set to `true`, which tells `isGlob` to match directories, potentially leading to different results than the original code.

DONE.
