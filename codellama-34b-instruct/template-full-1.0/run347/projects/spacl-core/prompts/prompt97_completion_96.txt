  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.size` would return the number of entries in the map, whereas `this.get` would return the value associated with the given key. This would result in different behavior, as the `query` method would return a different result depending on whether the policy exists in the map or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set` would add a new entry to the map, whereas `this.get` would return the value associated with the given key. This would result in different behavior, as the `query` method would return a different result depending on whether the policy exists in the map or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` would check if a given key exists in the map, whereas `this.get` would return a value associated with the given key
