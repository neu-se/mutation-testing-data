  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not always defined, and the code would throw an error if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not always defined, and the code would throw an error if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is not always defined, and the code would throw an error if it is not defined.

DONE.
