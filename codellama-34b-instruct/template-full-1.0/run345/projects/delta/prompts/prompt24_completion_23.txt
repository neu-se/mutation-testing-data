  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` is undefined, while `b.key` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key] === null` would always be true, while `b.key === null` would only be true if `b.key` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` would be undefined, while `delete b[key]` would remove the property from the object.
