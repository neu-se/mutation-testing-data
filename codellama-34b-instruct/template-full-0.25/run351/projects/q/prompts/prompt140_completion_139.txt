  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because `!p` is a negation of `p`, while `!!p` is a double negation of `p`, which is equivalent to `p`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `p && true` is a logical AND operation that always returns `true`, while `!!p` is a double negation of `p` that returns `p` if it is truthy or `false` if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `p || false` is a logical OR operation that always returns `p`, while `!!p` is a double negation of `p` that returns `p` if it is truthy or `false` if it is falsy.

DONE.
