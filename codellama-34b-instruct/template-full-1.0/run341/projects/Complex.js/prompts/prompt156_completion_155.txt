  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses at the end cause the method to be called, which would return a boolean value, and the `===` operator would check if the value returned by the method is the same as the value returned by the method call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator reverses the boolean value returned by the method, so the `===` operator would check if the value returned by the method is the opposite of the value returned by the method call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=== 0` operator checks if the value of the `re` property of the `Complex` instance is equal to 0, which would not necessarily be the same as the value returned by the `isZero()` method.

DONE.
