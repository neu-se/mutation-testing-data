  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + ".json", options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to read the file with a different name, ".json", which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding, file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to read the file with a different encoding, which may not be supported by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to read the file with a different encoding, which may not be supported by the function.

DONE.
