 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would continue consuming data even when `abort` is true, since `abort || true` would be replaced with just `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `read` would be `undefined` instead of a function, which could cause an error if `read` expects a function as its second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `read` would always be the result of `done || function () {}`, even if `abort` is true. This could cause unexpected behavior if `read` expects a function as its second argument and `done` is not a function.

DONE.
