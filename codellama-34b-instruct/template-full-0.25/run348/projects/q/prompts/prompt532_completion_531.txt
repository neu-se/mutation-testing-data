```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method of the `Promise` class that takes a fulfillment callback and an optional rejection callback, while `then` is a method of the `Promise` class that takes a fulfillment callback and an optional rejection callback, but it also returns a new promise that is fulfilled with the return value of the callback.

This would result in different behavior because `sp
