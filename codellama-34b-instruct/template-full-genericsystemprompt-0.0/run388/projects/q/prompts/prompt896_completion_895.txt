  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` would create a new deferred object with a null value, whereas `defer` would create a new deferred object with an undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(undefined)` would create a new deferred object with an undefined value, whereas `defer` would create a new deferred object with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null, null)` would create a new deferred object with a null value and a null reason, whereas `defer` would create a new deferred object with an undefined value and an undefined reason.

DONE.
