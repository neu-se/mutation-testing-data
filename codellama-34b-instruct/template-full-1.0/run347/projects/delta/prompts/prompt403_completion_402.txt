  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the properties of the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the property names of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the property names and values of the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.hasOwnProperty` returns a boolean indicating whether the given property exists on the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the property names.

DONE.
