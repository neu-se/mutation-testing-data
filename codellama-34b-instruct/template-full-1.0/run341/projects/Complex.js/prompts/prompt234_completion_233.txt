  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable "a" is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable "b" is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable "a" is greater than the variable "b".

DONE.
