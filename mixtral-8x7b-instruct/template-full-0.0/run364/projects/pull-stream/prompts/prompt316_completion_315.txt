 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `read` function with the `true` value for the `end` parameter, bypassing the original logic of the `terminate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the callback function with the `true` value, indicating an error, without checking the termination condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
