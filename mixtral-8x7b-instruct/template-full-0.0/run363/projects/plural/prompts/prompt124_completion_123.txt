 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the uncountable nouns would be converted to uppercase, instead of returning the same word as before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because an 'a' would be appended to the end of the uncountable nouns, instead of returning the same word as before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return rules.length }
