  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function is called instead of `nextChunk`, which results in the stream being skipped and the next stream being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextChunk` function is called immediately instead of being called conditionally, which can result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_read` variable is set to `null` instead of being called with a function, which can result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
