  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string is non-empty, whereas the replacement code fragment checks if the string is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string is non-empty, whereas the replacement code fragment checks if the string is empty and has a length of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string is non-empty, whereas the replacement code fragment checks if the string is undefined.

DONE.
