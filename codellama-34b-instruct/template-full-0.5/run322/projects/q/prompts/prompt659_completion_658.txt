  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would start from the second argument instead of the third.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would start from the third argument instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments[0], arguments[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return an array with only the first and third arguments, instead of all the arguments starting from the second one.

DONE.
