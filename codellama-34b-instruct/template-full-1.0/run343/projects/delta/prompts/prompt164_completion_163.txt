  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means it would return `true` not only when the peeked type is not `delete`, but also when it's a different type altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.peekLength()` method returns the length of the peeked element, which can be a different value than the length of the insertion if the peeked element is a different type of operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekOp() != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.peekOp()` method returns the peeked operation, which can be a different value than the insertion if the peeked element is a different type of operation.

DONE.
