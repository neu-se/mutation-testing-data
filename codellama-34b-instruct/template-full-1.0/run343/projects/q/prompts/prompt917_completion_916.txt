  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the nodeback function onto the end of the nodeArgs array, while this modified code fragment would pop it from the end of the array, resulting in a potentially different behavior if the function is expected to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the nodeback function onto the end of the nodeArgs array, while this modified code fragment would remove it from the beginning of the array, resulting in a potentially different behavior if the function is expected to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the nodeback function onto the end of the nodeArgs array, while this modified code fragment would remove it from the middle of the array, resulting in a
