  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `become(reject(reason));` is not executed, and the promise is not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(resolve(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `become(resolve(reason));` is not executed, and the promise is not resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `become(fulfill(reason));` is not executed, and the promise is not fulfilled.

DONE.
