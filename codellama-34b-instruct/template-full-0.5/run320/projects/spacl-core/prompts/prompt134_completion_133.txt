  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, which may not include all the verbs that are actually allowed or denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.values()` returns an array of the values in the `verbs` object, which may not include all the verbs that are actually allowed or denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.entries()` returns an array of the key-value pairs in the `verbs` object, which may not include all the verbs that are actually allowed or denied.

DONE.
