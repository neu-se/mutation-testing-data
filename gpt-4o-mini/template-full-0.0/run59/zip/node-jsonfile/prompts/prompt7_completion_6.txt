Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to read the file synchronously instead of asynchronously, which would lead to a runtime error when using `await` with a non-promise-returning function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file)
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the `file` argument to `fs.readFile`, which would cause the function to always read the same file regardless of the input provided to `_readFile`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the encoding option to always be 'utf8', potentially leading to issues if the file is not encoded in 'utf8', and ignoring any encoding specified in the `options` parameter.

DONE.
