  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the input, while the replaced code fragment calculates the negative hyperbolic cosine of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the input, while the replaced code fragment calculates the hyperbolic sine of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the input, while the replaced code fragment calculates the hyperbolic tangent of the input.

DONE.
