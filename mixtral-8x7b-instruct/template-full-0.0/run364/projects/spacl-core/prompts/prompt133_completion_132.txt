 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(this.verbs).reduce((obj, key) => {
  obj[key] = this.verbs[key];
  return obj;
}, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with the same keys and values, but it's a shallow copy. If the `verbs` object has nested objects or arrays, the original and the new object would not be equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.verbs))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a deep copy of the `verbs` object using JSON serialization and deserialization. However, this method has limitations, such as not being able to serialize functions, undefined values, or circular references.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because
