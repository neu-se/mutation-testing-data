  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` is a function that parses a string and returns an integer, whereas `parseFloat` is a function that parses a string and returns a floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a function that converts a value to a number, whereas `parseFloat` is a function that parses a string and returns a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` is a function that rounds a number to the nearest integer, whereas `parseFloat` is a function that parses a string and returns a floating-point number.

DONE.
