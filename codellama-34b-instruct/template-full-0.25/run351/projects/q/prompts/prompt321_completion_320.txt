  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a value of `null`, rather than the original value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, rather than resolve with the original value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("error")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, rather than resolve with the original value of `promise`.

DONE.
