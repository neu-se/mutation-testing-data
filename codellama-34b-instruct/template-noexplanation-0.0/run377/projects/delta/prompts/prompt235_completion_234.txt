  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This change will cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return the next `opLength + 1` elements from the `other` Delta, rather than just the next `opLength` elements. This could potentially cause the `diffResult` to be incorrect, as it is based on the comparison of the `strings` array, which is constructed from the `this` and `other` Deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This change will cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return the next `opLength - 1` elements from the `other` Delta, rather than just the next `opLength` elements. This could potentially cause the `diffResult` to be incorrect, as it is based on the comparison of the `strings` array, which is constructed from the `this` and `other` Deltas.
