  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the `options.dest` path, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace('bar', 'baz')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string "bar" with "baz" in the `options.dest` path, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `options.dest` path by "/" and return the last element, which may not be intended.

DONE.
