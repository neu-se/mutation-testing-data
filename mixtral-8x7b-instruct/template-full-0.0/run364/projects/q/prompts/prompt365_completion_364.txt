 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always skip the block of code that follows, regardless of the exception's status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate the condition as true, and the block of code that follows would always be executed, even if the exception is not truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate the condition as true, and the block of code that follows would always be executed, even if the exception is not an error object.

DONE.
