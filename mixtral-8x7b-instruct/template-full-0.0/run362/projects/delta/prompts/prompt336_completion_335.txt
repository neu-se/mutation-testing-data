 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `op.retain` value as true, even if it's `null`, `0`, or an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `op.retain` as true if it's a number, excluding cases where it's a string, boolean, object, or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.retain && typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `op.retain` as true if it's an object, excluding cases where it's a number, string, boolean, null, or undefined.

DONE.
