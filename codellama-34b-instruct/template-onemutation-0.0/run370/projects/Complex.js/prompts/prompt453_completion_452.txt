  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the imaginary part of `z` from the imaginary part of `this`, while the modified code fragment adds them together. This would cause the `equals` method to return `true` even if the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers are not equal, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
