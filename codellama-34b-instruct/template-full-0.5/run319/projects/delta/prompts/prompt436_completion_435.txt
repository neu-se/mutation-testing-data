  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but the replaced code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `retain` property is not a number, but the `delete` property is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but the replaced code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string, but the `delete` property is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number
