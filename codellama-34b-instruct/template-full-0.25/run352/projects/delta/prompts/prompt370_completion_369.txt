  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the given number of characters from the delta, whereas `retain` is a method that retains the given number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `retain` is an attribute map, which is used to apply attributes to the retained text. In this case, an empty attribute map is passed, which means that no attributes will be applied to the retained text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the second argument to `retain`, which means that the retained text will not have any attributes applied to it.

DONE.
