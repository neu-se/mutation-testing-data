  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverses of each other, and using `sin` instead of `cos` would produce a different value for the angle `Î¸`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` is not the same as `Math.log`, and using it would produce a different value for the logarithm of `r`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a different value than `180`, and using it would produce a different value for the divisor in the calculation of `y`.

DONE.
