  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.exp` function is called with a negative value, which would result in a complex number being passed to `cosh`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.exp` function is called with the same value as `x`, which would result in a different output for `Math.cos` and `cosh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.exp` function is called with a negative value, which would result in a complex number being passed to `cosh`.

DONE.
