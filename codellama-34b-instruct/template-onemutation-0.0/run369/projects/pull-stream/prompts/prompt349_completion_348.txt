  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `data` variable directly, while the mutated code fragment uses the `toUpperCase()` method on the `data` variable, which could potentially change the value of the variable.

DONE.
