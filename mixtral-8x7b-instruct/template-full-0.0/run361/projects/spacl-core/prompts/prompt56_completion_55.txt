 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(part)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `part` variable to a string and concatenates it with an empty string, instead of calling the `replace` method on the `part` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the `part` string into an array of individual characters, instead of calling the `replace` method on the `part` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part.toUpperCase()
