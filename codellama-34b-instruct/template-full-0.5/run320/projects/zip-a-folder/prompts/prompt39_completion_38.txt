  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the string "1" to the `src` string, which would change the path of the file being zipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src - "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting the string "1" from the `src` string, which would change the path of the file being zipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the string "a" to the `src` string, which would change the path of the file being zipped.

DONE.
