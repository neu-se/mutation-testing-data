  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function. This would cause a type error, which would be a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `undefined` is not a function. This would cause a type error, which would be a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but the empty function `function () {}` is not the same as the original function `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`. This would cause a different behavior in the code.
