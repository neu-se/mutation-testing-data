 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.nextTick(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback `cb` would be added to the event loop's queue instead of being called directly, potentially changing the order of execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback `cb` would be added to the next iteration of the event loop instead of being called directly, potentially changing the order of execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.get(key).push(cb || function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because even if `cb` is falsy, an empty function would still be added to the list of callbacks, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the developer relies on the `cb` argument being called or not.

DONE.
