  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while the original code fragment returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.filter(tz => tz.r !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the original code fragment returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.map(tz => tz.r === undefined ? tz : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array, while the original code fragment returns the original array.

DONE.
