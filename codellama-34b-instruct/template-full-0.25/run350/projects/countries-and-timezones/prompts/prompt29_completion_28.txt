  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset / 60` performs integer division and returns the quotient, while the new code fragment `offset % 60` performs the modulo operation and returns the remainder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset / 60` performs integer division and returns the quotient, while the new code fragment `offset * 60` performs multiplication and returns the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset / 60` performs integer division and returns the quotient, while the new code fragment `offset - 60` performs subtraction and returns the difference.

DONE.
