  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value of the first point instead of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the first point instead of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
