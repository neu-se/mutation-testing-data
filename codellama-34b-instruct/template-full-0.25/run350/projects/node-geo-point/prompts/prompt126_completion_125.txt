  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment would be using the `null` keyword, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment would be using the `undefined` keyword, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment would be using an empty object, which would cause the method to fail.

DONE.
