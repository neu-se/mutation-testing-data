  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert != otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks whether the two inserts are unequal, rather than checking if they are equal. This would cause the resulting Delta to be different from the expected output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.insert || !otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks whether the two inserts are falsey, rather than checking if they are equal. This would cause the resulting Delta to be different from the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === false && otherOp.insert === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks whether the two inserts are both false, rather than checking if they are equal. This would cause the resulting Delta to be different from the expected output.

DONE.
