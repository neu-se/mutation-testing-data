  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the replacement code fragment uses the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`. This would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the program's output. DONE.
