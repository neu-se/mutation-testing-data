  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string and `length` is a property of a string, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.indexOf('') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string and `indexOf` is a method of a string, so the comparison would always return `false`.

DONE.
