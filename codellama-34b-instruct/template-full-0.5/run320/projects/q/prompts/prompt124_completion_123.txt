  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition to the `if` statement, causing it to only execute if both conditions are true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition to the `if` statement, causing it to execute if either condition is true.

DONE.
