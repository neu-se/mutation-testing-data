  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the first string to itself, which would always result in an empty delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the first string to the third string, which could produce a different delta depending on the contents of the strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the length of the first string to the third string, which could produce a different delta depending on the lengths of the strings.

DONE.
