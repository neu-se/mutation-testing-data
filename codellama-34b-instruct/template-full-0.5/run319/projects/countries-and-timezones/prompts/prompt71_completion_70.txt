  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different object than the original code fragment, which would cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + "foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different object than the original code fragment, which would cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different object than the original code fragment, which would cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
