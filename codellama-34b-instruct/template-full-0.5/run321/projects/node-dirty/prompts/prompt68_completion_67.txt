  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.path` could be a falsy value other than `undefined`, such as an empty string or `null`, which would cause the `_load` method to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.path` could be an empty string, which would cause the `_load` method to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.startsWith('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.path` could start with the string 'foo', which would cause the `_load` method to be skipped.

DONE.
