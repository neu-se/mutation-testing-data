  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `cb` variable, potentially causing the callback to be called even if the test fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an argument to the `next` function, potentially causing it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ï¿½ Dumimming }
```
This would result in different behavior because a different value would be passed as an argument to the `next` function, potentially causing it to behave differently.

DONE.
