 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine function on the latitude value instead of the provided point2Rad variable, which could lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the point2Rad with a constant value of 0, causing the distance calculation to be inaccurate or always return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
acos(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the point2Rad with a constant value of acos(1), which is approximately equal to 1.5707963267948966 (Ï€/2). This could lead to incorrect distance calculations depending on the input values.

DONE.
