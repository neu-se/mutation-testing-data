  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a function, and replacing it with a string would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator, and `peekLength` would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by `peekLength` would be square rooted, which could cause a different comparison to be made in the code.

DONE.
