  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the function, while the new code would return early, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the function, while the new code would return a special value indicating that the result is infinite, potentially causing incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the function, while the new code would return NaN (Not a Number), potentially causing incorrect calculations.
