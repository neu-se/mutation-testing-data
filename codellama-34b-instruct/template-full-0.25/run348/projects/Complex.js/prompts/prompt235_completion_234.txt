  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sqrt(a + b)`, which takes the square root of the sum of `a` and `b`, while the replacement code uses `Math.sqrt(a)`, which takes the square root of `a` only. This would cause the calculation of the square root to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sqrt(a + b)`, which takes the square root of the sum of `a` and `b`, while the replacement code uses `Math.sqrt(b)`, which takes the square root of `b` only. This would cause the calculation of the square root to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sqrt(a +
