  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `ended` is falsy. This change would cause the function to behave differently when `ended` is a falsy value, such as `0` or `null`.

DONE.
