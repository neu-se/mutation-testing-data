  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.random() returns a random number between 0 and 1, while a['arg'] references the 'arg' property of object a.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because a['arg'] + Math.PI would offset the argument by pi, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because a['arg'] * 2 would double the argument, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
