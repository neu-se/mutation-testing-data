  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `seen` object would be mutated, causing the `unique` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `seen` object would be mutated, causing the `unique` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `seen` object would be mutated, causing the `unique` function to return a different result.

DONE.
