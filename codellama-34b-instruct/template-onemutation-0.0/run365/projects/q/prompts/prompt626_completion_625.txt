  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` is a bound function that will always refer to the original `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` may refer to a different context if it is called in a different context.
