  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `spec` string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of substrings based on the `/` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `spec` string into an array of substrings based on the `:` character, rather than the `/` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `spec` string into an array of substrings based on the `/` character, but using a regular expression instead of a string.

DONE.
