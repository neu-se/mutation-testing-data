  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1 && attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt2` would be evaluated even if `attempt1` is truthy, which is not the case with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1 || attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt2` would only be evaluated if `attempt1` is falsy, which is not the case with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attempt1 || attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt2` would be evaluated if `attempt1` is truthy, which is not the case with the original code.

DONE.
