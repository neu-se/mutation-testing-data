  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause an exception to be thrown, whereas `resolve` and `reject` simply return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(1)` returns a resolved promise with the value `1`, whereas `resolve` and `reject` return a promise with a different value.

DONE.
