  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fulfilled` method with `value` as an argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `fulfilled`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `rejected` method with `exception` as an argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `rejected`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
throw value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an exception with `value` as the message, whereas the original code fragment does not throw an exception.

DONE.
