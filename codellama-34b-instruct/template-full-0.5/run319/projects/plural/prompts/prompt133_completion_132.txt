  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` is a function that takes two arguments, while `rule[0]` is a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules[0]` is a string, while `rule[0]` is a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules.length` is a number, while `rule[0]` is a regular expression.

DONE.
