  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is called with a value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with that value, whereas the original code fragment called `deferred.reject` with an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms"));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called with a new error object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error, whereas the original code fragment called `deferred.resolve` with a resolved value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with that value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is called with a value, which would cause the promise to
