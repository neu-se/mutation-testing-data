  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` checks if there are any ops left to iterate over, whereas `peekType()` checks the type of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different op type, and the logic of the code would change accordingly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherIter.peek() === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the current op, and `typeof` checks the type of the returned op.

DONE.
