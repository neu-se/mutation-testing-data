  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, which is necessary for the trigonometric calculations in the `calculateDistance` method. Replacing the `deg2rad` function with the direct subtraction of the longitude values would result in incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect distances.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, which is necessary for the trigonometric calculations in the `calculateDistance` method. Replacing the `deg2rad` function with the multiplication of the longitude values by `Math.PI / 180` would result in incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect distances.
