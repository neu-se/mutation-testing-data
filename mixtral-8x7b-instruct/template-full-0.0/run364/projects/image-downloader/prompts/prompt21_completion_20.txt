 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the `options.dest` path relative to the current working directory instead of the module's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname + '/' + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the module's directory and `options.dest` with a string concatenation instead of using `path.resolve()` or `path.join()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest || '/tmp/image'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a default value for `options.dest` if it is falsy, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the test suite does not account for this change.

DONE.
