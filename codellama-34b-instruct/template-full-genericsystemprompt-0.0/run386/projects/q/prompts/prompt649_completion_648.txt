  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced, potentially changing the arguments passed to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.concat(["extra"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be added to the `args` array, potentially changing the behavior of the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the `args` array would be reversed, potentially changing the behavior of the `post` method.

DONE.
