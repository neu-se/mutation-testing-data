  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable gzip compression, even if the `archiverOptions` object specifies it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable gzip compression, even if the `archiverOptions` object specifies otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: !archiverOptions.gzip }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `gzip` property of the `archiverOptions` object.

DONE.
