  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then()` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is an object that does not have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect()` is a function that returns a string representation of the object, whereas `object` is an object that does not have an `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.valueOf()` is a function that returns the primitive value of the object, whereas `object` is an object that does not have a `valueOf` method.

DONE.
