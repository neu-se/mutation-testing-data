  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout + 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be increased by 1 second, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected at a different time than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout - 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be decreased by 1 second, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected at a different time than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be set to 0, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected immediately, regardless of the original delay time.

DONE.
