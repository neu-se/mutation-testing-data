  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` returns a deep copy of the input object, whereas `attributes` returns the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` returns a new object with the properties of the second argument object merged into the first argument object, whereas `attributes` returns the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(attributes, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` returns `true` if the two arguments are deeply equal, whereas `attributes` returns the original object.

DONE.
