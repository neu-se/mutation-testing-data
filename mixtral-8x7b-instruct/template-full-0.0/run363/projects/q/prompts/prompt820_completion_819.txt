 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method relies on the `fulfilled`, `rejected`, and `progress` arguments to determine how to handle the promise chain. By replacing it with `null`, the `done` method will not have the necessary information to handle the promise chain correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
