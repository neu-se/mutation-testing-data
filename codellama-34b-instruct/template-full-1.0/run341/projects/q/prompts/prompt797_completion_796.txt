  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5, 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `void 0` as a placeholder for a function that returns undefined, but this replacement introduces two numeric literals `5` and `10` which would be passed as arguments to the function, potentially changing its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `void 0` as a placeholder for a function that returns undefined, but this replacement introduces two boolean literals `true` and `false` which would be passed as arguments to the function, potentially changing its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `void 0` as a placeholder for a function that returns undefined, but this replacement introduces a new function that returns the value `42`.
