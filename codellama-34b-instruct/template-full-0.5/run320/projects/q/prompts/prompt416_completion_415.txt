  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value and would not pass the `isPromise` check, causing the `then` method to be called on `null`, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value and would not pass the `isPromise` check, causing the `then` method to be called on `undefined`, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `then` method to be called on a rejected promise, which would skip the fulfilled handler and call the rejected handler with the rejection reason.

DONE.
