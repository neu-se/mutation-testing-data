  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` function would be called instead of the `rule[0]` function, which could lead to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[2]` function would be called instead of the `rule[0]` function, which could lead to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[3]` function would be called instead of the `rule[0]` function, which could lead to a different outcome.

DONE.
