  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(true));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a truthy argument, which would cause the stream to be destroyed immediately, rather than waiting for the `'end'` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(false));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a falsy argument, which would cause the stream to be destroyed immediately, rather than waiting for the `'end'` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the stream to be destroyed immediately, rather than waiting for the `'end'` event to be emitted.
