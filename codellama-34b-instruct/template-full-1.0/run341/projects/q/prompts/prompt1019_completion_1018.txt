  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` is a direct reference to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch({})` creates a new object and passes it as an argument to the `dispatch` function, whereas `this.dispatch` does not pass any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch(null)` passes `null` as an argument to the `dispatch` function, whereas `this.dispatch` does not pass any arguments.

DONE.
