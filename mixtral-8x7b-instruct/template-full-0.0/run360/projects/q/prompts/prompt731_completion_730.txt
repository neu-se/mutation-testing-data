 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object in the `onProgress` function would be `null` instead of an object with `index` and `value` properties. This could cause issues for any code expecting a specific structure in the progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{index: index, progress: progress}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property is now named `progress`, which would cause issues for any code expecting the original `value` property in progress updates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which is not guaranteed to be the same as the original object. This could cause issues for any code expecting the progress updates to be related to the original promises.

DONE.
