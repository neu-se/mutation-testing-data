  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different method from `become`. `fulfill` is a method that is meant to be called by the deferred object to fulfill the promise, while `become` is a method that is meant to be called by the promise to change its state to fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different method from `become`. `resolve` is a method that is meant to be called by the deferred object to resolve the promise, while `become` is a method that is meant to be called by the promise to change its state to resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fulfill(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a method that is meant to be called by the deferred object
