 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would return an empty array instead of using the provided arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would use the raw `arguments` object instead of slicing it to an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would use `this` as the second argument for the `apply` method, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
