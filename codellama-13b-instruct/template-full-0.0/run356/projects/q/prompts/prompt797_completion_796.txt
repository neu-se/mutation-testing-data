  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing `undefined` as the first and second arguments to `then`, which means that the `progressed` function will be called whenever the promise is notified, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. The modified code fragment, on the other hand, is passing `void 0` as the first argument to `then`, which means that the `progressed` function will only be called when the promise is fulfilled.
