  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the value is a promise-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the value is a promise-like object, and the line number would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:1:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the value is a promise-like object, and the line number and column number would be different.

DONE.
