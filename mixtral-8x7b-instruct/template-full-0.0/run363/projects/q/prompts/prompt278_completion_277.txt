 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve.bind(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value, so `self.resolve` might not refer to the correct `resolve` function in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { self.resolve }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that returns `self.resolve`, which is not the same as calling `self.resolve` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `resolve` function in the global scope, which might not be the same as the `resolve` function in the current context.

DONE.
