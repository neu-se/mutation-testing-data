  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b`, instead of the square of `a`, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of `a` minus one, instead of the square of `a` plus one, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b * c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a`, `b`, and `c`, instead of the square of `a`, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
