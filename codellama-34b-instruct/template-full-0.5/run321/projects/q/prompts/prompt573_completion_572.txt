  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `null` as its argument, which would likely cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `undefined` as its argument, which would likely cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with an empty array as its argument, which would likely cause it to behave unexpectedly or throw an error.

DONE.
