 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new function with the `this` value set to a specific object, while `uncurryThis` returns a function that calls the original function with a specific `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` returns the string representation of an object, while `uncurryThis` is used to convert a method that takes one argument into a function that takes its arguments separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
