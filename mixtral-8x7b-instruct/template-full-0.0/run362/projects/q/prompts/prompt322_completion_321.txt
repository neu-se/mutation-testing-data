 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, so any modifications to the original `args` array after this point will not affect the copy used in the `promiseDispatch` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function () { return args; }())
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new execution context, which could have unintended side effects if `args` is an object with methods that rely on closure variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `descriptor[op]` call to always return `undefined`, which would then be passed to the `fallback` function. This could potentially cause the `fallback` function to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
