 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the split method would return an array with a single empty string element, causing the loop to iterate unnecessarily.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would escape the 'n' character, causing the split method to return an array with the original string as its only element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<PLACEHOLDER>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON.parse method would throw a syntax error, causing the loop to terminate prematurely.

DONE.
