  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function is not called, which means that the progress notifications are not forwarded to the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function is called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause unexpected behavior if the function expects a specific type of argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function is called with an empty function as an argument, which may cause unexpected behavior if the function expects a specific type of argument.

DONE.
