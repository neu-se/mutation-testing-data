  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the result of the callback, whereas this code returns a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Callback failed");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the result of the callback, whereas this code throws an error when the callback is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promise.inspect());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the result of the callback, whereas this code returns the result of the `inspect` method of the promise.

DONE.
