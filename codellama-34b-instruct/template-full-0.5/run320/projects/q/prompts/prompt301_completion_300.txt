  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the array elements is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain two references to the same object, rather than two different objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain a `null` value, rather than a reference to an object.

DONE.
