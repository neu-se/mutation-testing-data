  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would intentionally create an error in the write stream, which would cause the `close` event to be emitted with an error argument, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted with the same error argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would end the write stream and then destroy it, which would cause the `close` event to be emitted with no error argument, indicating that the stream was closed cleanly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would destroy the write stream with a null error argument, which would cause the `close` event to be emitted with no error argument, indicating that the stream was closed cleanly.
