  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract the offset from the index, regardless of whether the next type is 'delete' or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract the offset from the length, regardless of whether the next type is 'delete' or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the length and index, then subtract the offset, regardless of whether the next type is 'delete' or not.

DONE.
