 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now checks if `end` is truthy instead of just checking if it's not equal to `true`. This means that if `end` is a non-empty string, an array, an object, or a non-zero number, it will be treated as if the stream has ended, even if it hasn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now checks if `end` is falsy instead of just checking if it's equal to `true`. This means that if `end` is `null`, `undefined`, `0`, an empty string, or an empty array, it will be treated as if the stream has not ended, even if it has.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end !== true
