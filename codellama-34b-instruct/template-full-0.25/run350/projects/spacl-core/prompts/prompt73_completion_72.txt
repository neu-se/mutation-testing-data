  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method is not called in the original code, and it would cause the `query` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property is not used in the original code, and it would cause the `query` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.rules
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rules` property is not used in the original code, and it would cause the `query` method to return a different result.

DONE.
