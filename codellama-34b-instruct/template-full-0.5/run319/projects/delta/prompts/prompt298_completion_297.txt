  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the predicate function returns false, rather than true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the predicate function returns true, rather than false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the predicate function returns a value that is not false, rather than true.

DONE.
