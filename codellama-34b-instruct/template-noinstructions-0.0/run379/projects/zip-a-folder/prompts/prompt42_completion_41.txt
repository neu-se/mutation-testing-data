  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` is a method that adds a file to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.glob` is a method that adds a glob pattern to the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory` is a method that adds a directory to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.glob` is a method that adds a glob pattern to the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.finalize` is a method that finalizes the archive, whereas `zipArchive.glob` is a method that adds a glob pattern to the archive.

DONE.
