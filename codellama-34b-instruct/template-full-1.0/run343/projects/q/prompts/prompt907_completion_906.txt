  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doNothing
```
This would result in different behavior because the doNothing function does not exist, so an error would be thrown when the Promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notAFunction()
```
This would result in different behavior because the notAFunction function is never defined, so an error would be thrown when the Promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because theanonymous function does not call the deferred makeNodeResolver method, so the promise will not be properly resolved or rejected.

DONE.
