  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because `.value` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning the promise's fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `.fulfilled` is not a function, so it would return `undefined` instead of the promise's fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `.rejected` is not a function, so it would return `undefined` instead of the promise's rejection reason.

DONE.
