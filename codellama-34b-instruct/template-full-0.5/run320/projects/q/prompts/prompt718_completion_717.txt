  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with one element, the value `1`, instead of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with one element, the value `null`, instead of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with one element, the value `undefined`, instead of an empty array.

DONE.
