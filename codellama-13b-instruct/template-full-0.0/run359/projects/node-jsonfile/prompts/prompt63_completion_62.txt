  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called with the `'utf8'` encoding, which would cause the `Buffer` object to be converted to a string using the UTF-8 encoding. This would result in different behavior than the original code, which did not specify an encoding for the `toString()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('ascii')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called with the `'ascii'` encoding, which would cause the `Buffer` object to be converted to a string using the ASCII encoding. This would result in different behavior than the original code, which did not specify an encoding for the `toString()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('base64')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called with the `'base64'` encoding, which would cause the `
