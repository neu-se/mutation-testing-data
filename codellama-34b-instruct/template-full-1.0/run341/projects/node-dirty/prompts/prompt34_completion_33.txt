  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {})(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `(function () {})()` is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes no arguments and does nothing, so the `cb` callback function would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function (argument) { argument() })(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `(function (argument) {} (argument))` is an IIFE that takes a single argument `argument`, calls it with no arguments, and does nothing with the returned value. Note that the `cb` callback function is called with no arguments, which could be a potential bug if the callback function expects arguments to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function cbWrapper() { cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new function `cbWrapper` that calls `cb` and does not return any value. Note that the `cb` callback function is not called
