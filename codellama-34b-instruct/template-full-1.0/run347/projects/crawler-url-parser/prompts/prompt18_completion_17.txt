  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let refersToBaseUrl = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `refersToBaseUrl` variable is not defined in the original code, and its absence could cause the `parse` function to behave differently when it is called with a base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + "example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is used as an argument to the `parse` function. This change could cause the function to parse a different URL than it would with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive an undefined value for the `baseUrlStr` argument, which it might not handle correctly. This could cause the function to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
