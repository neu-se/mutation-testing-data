  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for greater than. This would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have more parts than the page URL, even if the parts are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length > pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for greater than. This would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have more parts than the page URL, even if the parts are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for inclusion. This would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that are a subset of
