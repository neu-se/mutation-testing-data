  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assign the `attributes` property of `newOp` to `this.ops[index-1]`, even if they were already equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assign the `attributes` property of `newOp` to `this.ops[index-1]` if they were not strictly equal (i.e., both `null` or `undefined`, or both an object with the same properties but different values).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assign the `attributes` property of `newOp` to `this.ops[index-1]` if they had a different number
