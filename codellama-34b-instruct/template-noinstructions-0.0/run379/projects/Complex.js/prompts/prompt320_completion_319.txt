  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which calculates the double of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `2 * a` calculates the double of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which calculates the double of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b * b` calculates the square of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which calculates the double of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a * b` calculates the product of the real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
