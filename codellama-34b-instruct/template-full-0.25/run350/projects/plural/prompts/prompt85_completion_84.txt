This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mouse', 'mice'`, which adds the plural form of the word "mouse" to the list of rules, while the new code fragment adds the same word twice, which would not change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mouse', 'mice'`, which adds the plural form of the word "mouse" to the list of rules, while the new code fragment adds a different plural form of the word "mouse" to the list of rules, which would change the behavior of the code.
