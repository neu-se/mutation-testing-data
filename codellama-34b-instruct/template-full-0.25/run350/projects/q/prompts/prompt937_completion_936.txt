  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be created with one less element than intended, which could cause the `nodeArgs` array to be constructed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be created with three more elements than intended, which could cause the `nodeArgs` array to be constructed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be created with zero elements, which would cause an error when trying to concatenate it with the `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
