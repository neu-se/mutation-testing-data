  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.reject` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` would dispatch the promise to be resolved later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` would return a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise plus 1, whereas `this.dispatch` would dispatch the promise to be resolved later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch(function(error) { return error.message; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` would return a new promise that resolves to the error message of the original promise, whereas `this.dispatch` would dispatch the promise to be resolved later.

DONE.
