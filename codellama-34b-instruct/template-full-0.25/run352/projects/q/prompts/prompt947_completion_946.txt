  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to the `nodeArgs.push` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a `null` argument, rather than being passed as an argument to the `nodeArgs.push` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the `deferred.reject` method as an argument, rather than being passed as an argument to the `nodeArgs.push` method.

DONE.
