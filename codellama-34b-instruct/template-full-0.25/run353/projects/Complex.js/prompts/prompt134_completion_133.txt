  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `z` variable is infinite, which is not the same as checking if the `this` object is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `this` object is infinite, which is not the same as checking if the `z` variable is infinite.

DONE.
