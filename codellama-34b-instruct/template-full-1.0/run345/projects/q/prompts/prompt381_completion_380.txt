  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on `null` instead of a promise, triggering a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `then` method would be called with a function that returns `undefined`, whereas the new function returns a promise that resolves to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would create a new promise that resolves to `promise`, rather than returning the original promise.

DONE.
