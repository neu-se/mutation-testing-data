  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `onFulfilled` function to be skipped and the `onRejected` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved, which would cause the `onProgress` function to be called instead of the `onFulfilled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a different value, which would cause the `onFulfilled` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
