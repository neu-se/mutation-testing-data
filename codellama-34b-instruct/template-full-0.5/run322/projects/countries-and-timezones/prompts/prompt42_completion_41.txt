  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object for the given id, instead of the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object for the given id, but with the deprecated property set to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezonesForCountry(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects for the given country id, instead of the country object.

DONE.
