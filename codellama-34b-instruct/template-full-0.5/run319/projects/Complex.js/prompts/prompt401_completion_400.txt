  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the result is less than or equal to 0, while this code fragment checks if it is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the result is less than or equal to 0, while this code fragment checks if it is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the result is less than or equal to 0, while this code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0.

DONE.
