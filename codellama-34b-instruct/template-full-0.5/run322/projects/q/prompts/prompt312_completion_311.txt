  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to `Q.race`, which would cause the resulting promise to resolve to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to `Q.race`, which would cause the resulting promise to resolve to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to `Q.race`, which would cause the resulting promise to resolve to a different value.

DONE.
