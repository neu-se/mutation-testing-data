  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Q.all` function to wait for all promises to be settled, rather than the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Q.allSettled` function to wait for all promises to be settled, rather than the `when` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allFulfilled(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Q.allFulfilled` function to wait for all promises to be fulfilled, rather than the `when` function.

DONE.
