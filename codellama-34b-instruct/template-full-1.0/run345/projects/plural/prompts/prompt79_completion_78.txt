  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bicycle'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'goose' is a word that ends with a "s" sound, while 'bicycle' ends with a "kl" sound, so the pluralized form would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'sheet'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'sheet' is a word that has a different pluralization rule than 'goose', and the placeholder is inside a RegExp that targets words that end with "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose|gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rule that matches the word 'goose' and pluralizes it to 'gooses', while the original code only pluralizes it to 'geese'.

DONE.
