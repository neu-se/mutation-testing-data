  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
link.parentNode
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx` is a global variable that refers to the current JavaScript context, while `link.parentNode` would refer to the parent node of a link element in an HTML document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
link.parentElement
```
This would result in different behavior because `link.parentElement` would refer to the parent element of a link element in an HTML document, while `ctx` is a global variable that refers to the current JavaScript context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
link.parentNode.nextSibling
```
This would result in different behavior because `link.parentNode.nextSibling` would refer to the next sibling of a link element in an HTML document, while `ctx` is a global variable that refers to the current JavaScript context.

DONE.
