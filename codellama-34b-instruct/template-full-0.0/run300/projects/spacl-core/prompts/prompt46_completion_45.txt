  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/\w+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match alphanumeric characters, whereas the original code fragment would match any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match alphanumeric characters and underscores, whereas the original code fragment would match any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match alphanumeric characters and underscores, whereas the original code fragment would match any character.

DONE.
