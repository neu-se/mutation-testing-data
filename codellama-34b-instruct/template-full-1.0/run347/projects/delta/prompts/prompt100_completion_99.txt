  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp` is an object with a `retain` property that is not equal to `0`, but instead `undefined` or `null`, then the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the replaced code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp != null && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp` is an object with a `retain` property that is not a number, but instead a string or a boolean, then the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the replaced code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp` is an object with a `retain` property that is equal to
