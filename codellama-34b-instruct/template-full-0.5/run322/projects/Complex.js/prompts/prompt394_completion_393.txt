  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `sinh` of `a`, while the mutated code calculates the `sinh` of `a + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `sinh` of `a`, while the mutated code calculates the `sinh` of `a * 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `sinh` of `a`, while the mutated code calculates the `sinh` of `a / 2`.

DONE.
