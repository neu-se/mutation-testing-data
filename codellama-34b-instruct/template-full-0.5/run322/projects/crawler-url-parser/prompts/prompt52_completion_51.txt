  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property of the `parsedUrl` object is a string representing the path of the URL, whereas the `parsedUrl` object itself is an instance of the `URL` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property of the `parsedUrl` object is a string representing the hostname of the URL, whereas the `pathname` property is a string representing the path of the URL. By concatenating these two properties, we would be creating a new URL that is a combination of the hostname and the path of the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol + "://" + parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property of the `parsed
