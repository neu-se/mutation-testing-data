  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `stripBom` function checks for the presence of a Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the data, while this replacement code uses a regular expression to remove any BOM characters from the beginning of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `stripBom` function checks for the presence of a Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the data, while this replacement code simply removes the first character of the data, regardless of whether it is a BOM character or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `stripBom` function checks for the presence of a Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the data
