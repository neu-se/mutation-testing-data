  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new policy with the same name as the original policy, but without cloning the underlying rules. This could cause issues if the policy is used in a way that relies on the rules being cloned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new policy with the same name as the original policy, and with cloned rules. This could cause issues if the policy is used in a way that relies on the rules not being cloned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(name, Math.random() < 0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new policy with the same name as the original policy, and with a random selection of cloned or non-cloned
