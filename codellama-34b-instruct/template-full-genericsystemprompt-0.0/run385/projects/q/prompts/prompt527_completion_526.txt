  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is an array, and `args[0]` would only pass the first element of the array as an argument to the `dispatch` function, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.slice(1)` expression would pass all but the first element of the `args` array as arguments to the `dispatch` function, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.concat(args)` expression would pass the `args` array twice as arguments to the `dispatch` function, whereas the original code passes the `args` array only once.

DONE.
