 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = answerPs.length, len = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will not execute since `i` is assigned to `answerPs.length` which is initially greater than `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = -1, len = answerPs.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will not execute in the first iteration since `i` is initially assigned to `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i, len = answerPs.length; for (i in answerPs) { Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop uses a `for...in` statement instead of a `for` loop, which can iterate over properties of the `answerPs` array object, not just its elements.

DONE.
