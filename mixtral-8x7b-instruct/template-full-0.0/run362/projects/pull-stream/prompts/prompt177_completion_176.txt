 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `true` (indicating the end of the iteration) once the initial condition is checked, even if the array has elements left to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stop iterating once the length of the array and the index are equal, which means that the last element would not be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.shift() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there is a value to shift from the array instead of checking the index. This would cause the iteration to stop once it encounters an undefined value (which could be the case if the array has empty slots), even if there are more elements left in the array.

DONE.
