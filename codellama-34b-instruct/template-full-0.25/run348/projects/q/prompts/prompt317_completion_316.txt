  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function expects a non-null object as its first argument, and using `null` would cause the function to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function expects a non-null object as its first argument, and using `undefined` would cause the function to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function expects a non-null object as its first argument, and using an empty object literal would cause the function to return a new object with no properties.

DONE.
