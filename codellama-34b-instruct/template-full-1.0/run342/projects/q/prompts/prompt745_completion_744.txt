  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` have different function signatures, and `onRejected` would not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_ => onFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is called with a different `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` would not be called at all.

DONE.
