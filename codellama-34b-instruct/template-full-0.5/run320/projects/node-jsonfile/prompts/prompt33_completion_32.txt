  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the number of bytes written, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that is called with the correct `this` value, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an unbound function that may not be called with the correct `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(function (file, data, options) {
  return fs.writeFile(file, data, options);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because
