  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork()` is a method that removes the cork from the `Writable` stream, allowing it to resume writing. By replacing `this._writeStream.uncork()` with `this._writeStream.uncork(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, the `uncork()` method is still being called, but with a placeholder argument, which would likely cause a type error or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for the `uncork()` method. By replacing `this._writeStream.uncork()` with `this._writeStream.uncork(null)`, the program would likely throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(<PLACEHOLDER>);
