  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function, while `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` takes a callback function as its last argument, while `fs.writeFile` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync('file', 'data', 'utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` takes a file name, data, and encoding as its arguments, while `fs.writeFile` takes a file name, data, and options as its arguments.

DONE.
