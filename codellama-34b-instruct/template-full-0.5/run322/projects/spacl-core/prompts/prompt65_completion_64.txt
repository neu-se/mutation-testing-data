  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...this.rules
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `this.rules` array onto the `this.rules` array, resulting in a nested array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a shallow copy of the `rules` array onto the `this.rules` array, resulting in a different array object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.map((rule) => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a deep copy of the `rules` array onto the `this.rules` array, resulting in a different array object with different rule objects.

DONE.
