  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second line of the stack trace instead of the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[2].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the third line of the stack trace instead of the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[3].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the fourth line of the stack trace instead of the first line.

DONE.
