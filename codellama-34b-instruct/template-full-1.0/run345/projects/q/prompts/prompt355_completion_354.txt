  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new exception object, instead of using the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.message = "New exception message"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the message of the exception object, which could affect how it is handled by the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.stack = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the stack trace from the exception object, which could make it harder to debug the code that threw the exception.

DONE.
