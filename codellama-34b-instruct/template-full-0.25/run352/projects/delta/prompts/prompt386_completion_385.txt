  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the next operation in both iterators to be added together, potentially resulting in an incorrect value being used in the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the next operation in the first iterator to be subtracted from the length of the next operation in the second iterator, potentially resulting in an incorrect value being used in the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the next operation in the second iterator to be subtracted from the length of the next operation in the first iterator, potentially resulting in an incorrect value being used in the comparison.

DONE
