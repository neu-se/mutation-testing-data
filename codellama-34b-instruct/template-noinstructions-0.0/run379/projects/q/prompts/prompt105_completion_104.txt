  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is incremented before it is used in the `this[index]` expression, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is decremented before it is used in the `this[index]` expression, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is multiplied by 2 before it is used in the `this[index]` expression, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array and also cause the loop to iterate over the same element twice.
