  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method is replaced with "send", which is a different method that may have different behavior or arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the "post" method, which may cause the method to behave differently or produce an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "nodeArgs" array is reversed before being passed to the "post" method, which may cause the method to behave differently or produce an error.

DONE.
