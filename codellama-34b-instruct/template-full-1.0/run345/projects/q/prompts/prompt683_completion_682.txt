  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to call the `dispatch` method on `null`, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to call the `dispatch` method on `undefined`, which would also cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a rejected promise, where as the original code returns a promise that resolves to the value.

DONE.
