Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the resolved promise would indicate that there is no value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the promise is used later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of the resolved promise would also indicate that there is no value, which could cause issues in promise chaining or when checking the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `valueOf()` on `resolvedPromise` may return a primitive value or an object, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's state or value, especially if `resolvedPromise` is not a simple value.

DONE.
