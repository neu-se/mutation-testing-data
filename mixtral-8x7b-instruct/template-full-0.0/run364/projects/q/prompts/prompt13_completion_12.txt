 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `true`, bypassing the `ses.makeQ = definition;` assignment and not initializing Q as a global in non-windowed contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would be `false` due to the incorrect equality comparison, and the `ses.makeQ = definition;` assignment would not be executed, preventing Q from being initialized as a global in non-windowed contexts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.noConflict()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the Q global from the global namespace, causing any further references to Q to be undefined. This would break the functionality that relies on the Q global.

DONE.
