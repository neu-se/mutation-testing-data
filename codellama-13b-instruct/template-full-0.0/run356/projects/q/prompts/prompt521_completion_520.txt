  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would reject the promise with an error object, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Notified")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would notify the promise with the value "Notified", whereas the original code fragment `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
