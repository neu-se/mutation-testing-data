  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round down to the nearest hour, whereas the original code rounds to the nearest minute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round up to the nearest hour, whereas the original code rounds to the nearest minute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round to the nearest hour, whereas the original code rounds to the nearest minute.

DONE.
