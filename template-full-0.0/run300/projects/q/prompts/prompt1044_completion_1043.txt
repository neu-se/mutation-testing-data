  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the value of the `head` property, while this replacement code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the value of the `tail` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the value of the `head` property, while this replacement code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the value of the `tail` property, and then uses the `get` method again to retrieve the value of the `tail` property of the resulting object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get` method to retrieve the value of the
