  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `arguments` would refer to the original `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([])` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by an empty array, whereas `arguments` would refer to the original `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(0, -1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the last one, whereas `arguments` would refer to the original `arguments` object.

DONE.
