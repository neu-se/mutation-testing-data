  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to check if all elements in an array pass a certain condition, while `none` is not a valid keyword in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to check if all elements in an array pass a certain condition, while `some` is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to check if any element in an array passes a certain condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
every
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to check if all elements in an array pass a certain condition, while `every` is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to check if all elements in an array pass a certain condition.

DONE.
