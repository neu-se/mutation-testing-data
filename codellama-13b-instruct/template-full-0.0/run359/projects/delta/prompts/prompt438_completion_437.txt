  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `nextOp` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is an object. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `nextOp` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is not null. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `nextOp` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is undefined. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.
