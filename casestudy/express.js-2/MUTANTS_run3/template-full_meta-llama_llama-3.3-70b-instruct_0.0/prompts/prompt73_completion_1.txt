Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.remotePort, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trust` function is called with a different port number, potentially changing the trust proxy evaluation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.localAddress, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trust` function is called with the local address instead of the remote address, which could lead to incorrect trust proxy decisions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trust` function is called with a null address, which may cause it to always return false or throw an error, depending on its implementation.

DONE.
