 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the result for the case when the base is fully imaginary would always be `(0, 0)`, regardless of the exponent value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the formula for calculating the power of two complex numbers, leading to incorrect results when the base is fully imaginary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the absolute value calculation with a square root, which could lead to incorrect results when calculating the power of two complex numbers.

DONE.
