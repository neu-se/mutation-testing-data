  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with a fixed array would cause the function to always use the same values, regardless of the arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object to access the arguments passed to the function, while `this` refers to the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object to access the arguments passed to the function, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties.

DONE.
