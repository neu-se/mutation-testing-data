  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns true if the input URL has illegal characters, while the replaced code always returns false, regardless of the URL's contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns true if the input URL has illegal characters, while the replaced code returns true if the URL does not have illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !_has_illegal_chars;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input URL has illegal characters using the `has_illegal_chars` function, while the replaced code always returns true, regardless of the URL's contents.
