  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This change will cause the `baseArgs` array to be constructed with one fewer element than it should be, which will result in the `nodeArgs` array being constructed with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This change will cause the `baseArgs` array to be constructed with three more elements than it should be, which will result in the `nodeArgs` array being constructed with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This change will cause the `baseArgs` array to be constructed with zero elements, which will result in the `nodeArgs` array being constructed with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
