  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'cellos', which is the plural form of 'cello'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'violins'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'cellos', which is the plural form of 'cello', while 'violins' is the plural form of 'violin'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'guitars'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'cellos', which is the plural form of 'cello', while 'guitars' is the plural form of 'guitar'.

DONE.
