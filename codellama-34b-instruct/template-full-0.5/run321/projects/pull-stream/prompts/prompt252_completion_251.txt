  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `_read`, causing the `if` statement to be entered even if `_read` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_read` variable is now being incremented by 1, causing the `if` statement to be entered even if `_read` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is being set to `null`, causing the `if` statement to be entered even if `_read` is falsy.

DONE.
