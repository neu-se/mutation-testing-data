  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the arguments in the order of `b` followed by `a`, while the new code fragment `a, b` returns the arguments in the order of `a` followed by `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the arguments in the order of `b` followed by `a`, while the new code fragment `b, a` returns the arguments in the order of `b` followed by `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the arguments in the order of `b` followed by `a`, while the new code fragment `a, b` returns the arguments in the order of `a` followed by `b`.

DONE.
