  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () { return progressed; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (value) { return progressed(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
