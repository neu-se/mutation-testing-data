  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This change will cause the `clone()` method to be called on the `ctx` object, which may have unintended consequences if the `clone()` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.deepCopy()
```
This change will cause the `deepCopy()` method to be called on the `ctx` object, which may have unintended consequences if the `deepCopy()` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.copy()
```
This change will cause the `copy()` method to be called on the `ctx` object, which may have unintended consequences if the `copy()` method is not implemented correctly.

DONE.
