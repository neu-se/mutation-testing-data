  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
twice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `twice` function would return a value that is different from the value returned by the `once` function, which could lead to unexpected results in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` keyword is a Boolean value that is not a function, and would not cause the same side effects as the `once` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not cause any side effects, unlike the `once` function, which would call the `cb` function with a specific value.

DONE.
