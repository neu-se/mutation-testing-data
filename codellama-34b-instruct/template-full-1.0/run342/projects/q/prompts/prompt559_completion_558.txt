  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotIteration(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotIteration()` is not a defined function, and would cause a ReferenceError to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name !== "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the exception has a name different from "StopIteration", rather than checking if the exception is an instance of StopIteration. If the exception is not an instance of StopIteration, the code would not behave as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isIteration(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isIteration()` is not a defined function, and would cause a ReferenceError to be thrown.

DONE.
