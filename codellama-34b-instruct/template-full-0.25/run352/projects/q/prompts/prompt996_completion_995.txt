  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error when invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not have the same behavior as `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
