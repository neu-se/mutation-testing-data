  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is null. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the `callback` argument is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is false. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the `callback` argument is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is 0. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the `callback` argument is 0.

DONE.
