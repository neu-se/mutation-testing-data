  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.hostname` is a different value than `ret.host`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.host` is a different value than `ret.host`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.pathname` is a different value than `ret.host`.

DONE.
