  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with `null` as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, rather than the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with `undefined` as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined`, rather than the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(false));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with `false` as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `false`, rather than the expected value.

DONE.
