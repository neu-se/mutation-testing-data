  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a reserved word in JavaScript and would cause a syntax error if used in place of `reject`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` would cause the function to end prematurely and not execute the `reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(exception).resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolve()` method of the `Q` promise with the `exception` value, rather than calling the `reject()` method with that value.

DONE.
