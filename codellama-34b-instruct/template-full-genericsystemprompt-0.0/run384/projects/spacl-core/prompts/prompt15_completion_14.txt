  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string, including the trailing slash, instead of just the last segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/(?!$)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string, excluding the trailing slash, instead of just the last segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/(?!\/)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string, excluding the trailing slash, and the negative lookahead assertion ensures that the last segment is not empty.

DONE.
