  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a different method than `this.all`, and it would change the way the promise is handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` is a different method than `this.all`, and it would change the way the promise is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.finally` is a different method than `this.all`, and it would change the way the promise is handled.

DONE.
