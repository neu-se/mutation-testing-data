  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being incremented by 1, which would change the value of the `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being multiplied by 2, which would change the value of the `key` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `field` object is being accessed, which would return a different value than the original `field` variable.

DONE.
