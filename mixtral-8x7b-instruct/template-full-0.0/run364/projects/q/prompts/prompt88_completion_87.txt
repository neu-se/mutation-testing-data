 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object and pass only the second argument to `call` method, which would cause `f` to lose its `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value to the `call` method, causing `f` to lose its `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
