  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property of the `data` object, whereas the original code fragment would return the `data` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key + 1` property of the `data` object, whereas the original code fragment would return the `data` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key] = 'new value'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `key` property of the `data` object to `'new value'`, whereas the original code fragment would return the `data` object itself.

DONE.
