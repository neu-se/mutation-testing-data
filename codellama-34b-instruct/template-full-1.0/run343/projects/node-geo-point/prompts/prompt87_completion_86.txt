  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, whereas the original code fragment returns a positive or negative value depending on the orientation of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ - cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a negative value when the angle is greater than 90 degrees, whereas the original code fragment returns a positive value in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the effect of the angle on the returned value, whereas the original code fragment returns a value directly proportional to the angle.

DONE.
