  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of ops being iterated, potentially causing the loop to skip over an op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes.slice() || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the op's attributes, potentially causing a mutation of the op's attributes without the intention to do so.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete iter.next(1).attributes['bold']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the 'bold' attribute from the op's attributes, potentially changing the behavior of the code that uses these attributes.

DONE.
