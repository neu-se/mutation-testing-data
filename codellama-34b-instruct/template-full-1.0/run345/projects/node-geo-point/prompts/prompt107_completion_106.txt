  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```2.1```
This would result in different behavior because the code uses a constant of 2.1 instead of 2, which could cause a difference in the calculation of the tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```3```
This would result in different behavior because the code uses a constant of 3 instead of 2, which could cause a more significant difference in the calculation of the tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```radius - 1```
This would result in different behavior because the code uses the radius of the Earth minus 1 instead of 2, which could cause a difference in the calculation of the tile coordinate.

DONE.
