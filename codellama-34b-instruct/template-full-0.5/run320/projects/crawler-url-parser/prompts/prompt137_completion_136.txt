  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to replace any occurrence of `/` with an empty string, while the new code would only replace the first occurrence of `/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to replace any occurrence of `/` with an empty string, while the new code would replace the first occurrence of `/` with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\' + '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to replace any occurrence of `/` with an empty string, while the new code would replace the first occurrence of `/` with a backslash and then replace the second occurrence of `/` with an empty string.

DONE.
