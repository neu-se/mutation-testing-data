  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so if `ended` is `true`, `!ended` would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `ended` and `!end` are `true`, and if so, it returns `true`. If `ended` is `true` and `!end` is `false`, the expression would return `false`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `ended` or `!end` is `true`, and if so, it
