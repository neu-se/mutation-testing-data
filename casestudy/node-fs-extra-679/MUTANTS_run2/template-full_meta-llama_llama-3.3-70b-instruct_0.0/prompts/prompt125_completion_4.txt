Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(new Error('Unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an error, even when the destination parent is not a subdirectory of the source, which is not the expected behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, { srcStat, destStat: null })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a successful callback with `destStat` set to `null`, even when the destination parent is a subdirectory of the source, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the file system structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a successful callback without any error or additional information, even when the destination parent is a subdirectory of the source, which could lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
