  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive `undefined` as the fulfillment value, rather than the original `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive `null` as the fulfillment value, rather than the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive the string `"foo"` as the fulfillment value, rather than the original `value`.

DONE.
