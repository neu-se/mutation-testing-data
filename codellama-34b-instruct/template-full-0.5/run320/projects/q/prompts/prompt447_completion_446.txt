  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { throw new Error("Intentional error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would simply return the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { return; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined`, whereas the original code would return the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { return 42; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `42`, whereas the original code would return the promise.

DONE.
