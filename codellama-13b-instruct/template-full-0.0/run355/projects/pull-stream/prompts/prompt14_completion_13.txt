  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `<=` operator to check if `i` is less than or equal to `length`, while the buggy code fragment uses the `<` operator to check if `i` is less than `length`. This would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time than the original code, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `<` operator to check if `i` is less than `length`, while the buggy code fragment uses the `<=` operator to check if `i` is less than or equal to `length`. This would cause the loop to iterate one more time than the original code, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

var i = 0; i = length; i
