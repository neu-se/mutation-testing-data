  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the `promise` object as the context, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.apply(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the `promise` object as the context, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
