  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses less than or equal to (<=) to check if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while this new code uses less than (<) to check if the number of in-flight writes is less than 0. This means that the original code would allow for the possibility of 0 in-flight writes, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses less than or equal to (<=) to check if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while this new code uses greater than or equal to (>=) to check if the number of in-flight writes is greater than or equal to 0. This means that the original code would allow for the possibility of 0 in-flight
