  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects a promise as an argument, but `null` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects a promise as an argument, but `undefined` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects a promise as an argument, but `0` is not a promise.

DONE.
