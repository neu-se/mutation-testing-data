  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an array of arguments, and "test" is a string. It would cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an array of arguments, and 0 is a number, not an array. It would cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an array of arguments, and undefined is not an array. It would cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
