  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is used to handle errors, while the `then` method is used to handle successful resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is used to handle errors, while the `done` method is used to handle the final resolution of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is used to handle errors, while the `catch` method is used to handle errors in a promise chain.

DONE.
