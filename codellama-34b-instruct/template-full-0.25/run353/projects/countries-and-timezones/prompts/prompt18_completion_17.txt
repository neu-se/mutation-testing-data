  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `a` to the `all` array, rather than the `id` value that was originally pushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(tz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `tz.r` to the `all` array, rather than the `id` value that was originally pushed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(aliasTz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `aliasTz.r` to the `all` array, rather than the `id` value that was originally pushed.

DONE.
