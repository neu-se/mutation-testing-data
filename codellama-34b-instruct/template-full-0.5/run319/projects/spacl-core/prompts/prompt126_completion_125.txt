  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, whereas the replaced code fragment checks if `ctx` is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, whereas the replaced code fragment checks if `ctx` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, whereas the replaced code fragment checks if `ctx` is null.

DONE.
