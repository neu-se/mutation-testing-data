Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is infinite, which would change the outcome of the division operation when `z` is zero, potentially leading to a division by zero scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines the checks for both `this` being infinite and `z` being zero, which would alter the logic of the division operation and may not return `Complex['ZERO']` when expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if either `z` is infinite or `this` is zero, which would lead to returning `Complex['INFINITY']` in cases where the original logic would have returned `Complex['ZERO']`.

DONE.
