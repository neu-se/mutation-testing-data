  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(null)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, which would cause the `delay` method to return a promise that is already resolved, rather than a promise that is resolved after the specified delay.
