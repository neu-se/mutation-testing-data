  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.r !== undefined && a.phi !== undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of `r` and `phi` properties in `a` rather than the `r` and `phi` properties in `a` containing valid values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.r && a.phi;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the truthiness of the `r` and `phi` properties in `a` rather than the `r` and `phi` properties in `a` containing valid values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a.r === 'number' && typeof a.phi === 'number';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the type of the `r` and `phi` properties in `a` to be numbers rather than the `r` and `phi` properties in `a` containing valid values.

DONE
