  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match(this.regex)` returns a `Match` object, which is not a boolean value, and would cause the `if` statement to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match(this.regex).length` returns the number of matches found, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match(this.regex)[0]` returns the first match found, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
