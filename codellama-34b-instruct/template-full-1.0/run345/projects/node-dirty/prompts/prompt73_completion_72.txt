  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code != 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator will always return `true` when the error code is not equal to `'ENOENT'`, which means that the code in the `if` block will always be executed, even if the error code is not `'ENOENT'`. This could cause the program to behave unexpectedly and potentially incorrectly handle errors.  

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EINVAL'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `EINVAL` error code indicates that an invalid argument was passed to the function that threw the error. By changing the conditional to check for this error code instead of `'ENOENT'`, the code will execute the `if` block when an invalid argument was passed to the function, and will not execute when an `'ENOENT'` error occurs.  

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTFO
