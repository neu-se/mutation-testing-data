  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"INVALID"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountriesForTimezone` function would return an empty array instead of an array of countries, as the `tzName` parameter would be invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountriesForTimezone` function would return an empty array instead of an array of countries, as the `tzName` parameter would be null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountriesForTimezone` function would return an empty array instead of an array of countries, as the `tzName` parameter would be undefined.

DONE.
