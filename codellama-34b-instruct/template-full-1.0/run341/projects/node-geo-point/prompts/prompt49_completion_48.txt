  Sure, here are three options for a buggy code fragment to replace the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is used instead of `latitude`, which would cause the calculation to be off by 90 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant value of 10 is added to the `latitude` property, which would cause the calculation to be off by 10 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.getLatitude() + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getLatitude()` method is used instead of the `latitude` property, which would cause the calculation to be off by 10 degrees.

DONE.
