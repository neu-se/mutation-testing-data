 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data as the error instead of the actual error object. This could cause issues downstream if the error handling code expects an Error object with a stack trace and other properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the error and continue processing the data. This could cause issues if the error needs to be handled or propagated upstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Artificial error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new Error object with a custom message, even if there is no actual error. This could cause unnecessary error handling or mask the real error if there is one.

DONE.
