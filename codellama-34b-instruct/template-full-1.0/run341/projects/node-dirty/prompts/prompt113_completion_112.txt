  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have an `emit` method. The original code uses `this.emit` to emit an event on the current object. Replacing it with `null.emit` would result in a TypeError because `null` does not have an `emit` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have an `emit` method. The original code uses `this.emit` to emit an event on the current object. Replacing it with `undefined.emit` would result in a TypeError because `undefined` does not have an `emit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'.emit

This would result in different behavior because `'load'` is not an object and does not have an `emit` method. The original code uses `this.emit
