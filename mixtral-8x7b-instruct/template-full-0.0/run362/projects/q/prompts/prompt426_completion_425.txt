 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state || "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the state is equal to "fulfilled", while the modified code checks if the state is truthy, which could include other states like "pending" or "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state === "something_else";
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "something\_else" is not a valid state of a promise, so the function will always return false, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the value of the promise instead of its state. If the promise is fulfilled, it will return the fulfillment value, but if the promise is rejected, it will throw an error.

DONE.
