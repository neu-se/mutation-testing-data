 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && typeof newOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the type check for `newOp.insert` is added, which was not present in the original code fragment. This change would cause the `push` method to behave differently when `newOp.insert` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lastOp.hasOwnProperty('delete') && newOp.insert != null
