  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `rejected` function is called with `reason` as an argument, which is a rejected promise. In this modified code, `null` is passed instead, which may cause the `rejected` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `rejected` function is called with `reason` as an argument, which is a rejected promise. In this modified code, `undefined` is passed instead, which may cause the `rejected` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `rejected` function is called with `reason` as an argument, which is a rejected promise. In this modified code, `Promise.resolve(reason)` is passed instead
