  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.**countryName**, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would receive a different argument. In the original code, the `getCountry` function receives two arguments: the country ID and the options object. By replacing the `c` argument with `c.countryName`, the function would receive a string as its first argument instead of an object, which could cause it to fail if it relies on the structure of the `c` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would receive a different argument. In the original code, the `getCountry` function receives two arguments: the country ID and the options object. By replacing the `c` argument with `null`, the function would receive a `null` value as its first argument, which could cause it to fail if it relies on the structure of the `c` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
