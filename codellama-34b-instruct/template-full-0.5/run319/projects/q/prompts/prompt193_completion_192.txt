  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3 !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!=` operator, which checks for strict inequality, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attempt3` variable is truthy, whereas the replacement code fragment checks if the `attempt3` variable has a length greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attempt3` variable is truthy, whereas the replacement code fragment checks if the first element of the `attempt3` array is not undefined.

DONE.
