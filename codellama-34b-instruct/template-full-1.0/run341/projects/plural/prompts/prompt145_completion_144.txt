  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function defined in the code, but by replacing it with the string "undefined", it becomes a string and the `substr` function will not work as expected, resulting in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function defined in the code, but by replacing it with the string "null", it becomes a string and the `substr` function will not work as expected, resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"typeof"
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function defined in the code, but by replacing it with the string "typeof", it becomes a string and the `substr` function will not work as expected, resulting in an error.

DONE.
