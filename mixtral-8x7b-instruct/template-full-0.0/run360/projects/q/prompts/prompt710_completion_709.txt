 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).dispatch('not_keys')
```
This would result in different behavior because 'not\_keys' is not the correct method name for getting object keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null).dispatch('keys')
