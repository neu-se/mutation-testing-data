  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the key as the second argument to `get`, instead of passing the key directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the key and `undefined` as the second argument to `get`, instead of passing the key directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with `undefined` and the key as the second argument to `get`, instead of passing the key directly.

DONE.
