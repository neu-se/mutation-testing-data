  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` would terminate the stream, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` would terminate the stream with an error, while the new code fragment `cb(ended)` would terminate the stream with a success.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` would terminate the stream with an error, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would not.

DONE.
