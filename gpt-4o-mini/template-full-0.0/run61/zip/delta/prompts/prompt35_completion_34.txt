Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the function to proceed when `b` is not an object, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors when trying to access properties of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `b` is strictly `null`, ignoring other non-object types (like arrays or functions) that should also cause the function to return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to proceed if `b` is an array, which is technically an object, thus bypassing the intended check for non-object types and potentially leading to incorrect handling of the input.

DONE.
