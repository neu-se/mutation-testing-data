  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `load` event, which could cause the event listener function to receive an unexpected argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    'error', new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted with a new error object, which could trigger error handling code that is not intended to be used in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    'update', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` event would be emitted without any data, which could cause the event listener function to receive an unexpected data argument.

DONE.
