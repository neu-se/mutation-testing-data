  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is called, which resets the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays, causing the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array is set to an empty array, causing the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array is set to an empty array, causing the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return an empty array.

DONE.
