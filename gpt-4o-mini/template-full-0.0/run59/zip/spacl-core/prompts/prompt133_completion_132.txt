Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object instead of the actual properties, potentially leading to incorrect copying of verb permissions if the keys are not the same as the properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb] = !this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of each verb instead of copying it, which could lead to unexpected permissions being set in the cloned rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.verbs[verb] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set all verbs in the cloned rule to `true`, effectively allowing all actions regardless of the original rule's permissions.

DONE.
