 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeback` is a function argument, while `true` is a boolean literal. This change would cause the `nodeback` function to not be called in the success case, breaking the expected behavior of the `nodeify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeback` is a function argument, while `null` is an object. This change would cause the `nodeback` function to not be called in the success case, leading to different behavior than the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout
