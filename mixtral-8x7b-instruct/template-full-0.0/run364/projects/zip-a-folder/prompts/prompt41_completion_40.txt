 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when splitting the `src` string in the `compress` method, as an empty string cannot be used as a separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'or'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `src` string is split in the `compress` method, potentially leading to unexpected results when processing the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compress` method to treat the `src` string as a single glob pattern, instead of splitting it based on the provided separator. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing the input.

DONE.
