  Sure, I'd be happy to help with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl.format() + parsedUrl.format())
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` expects a string input, whereas `parsedBaseUrl` and `parsedUrl` are `URL` objects. By calling `format()` on each object and concatenating them before passing them to `URL.parse()`, the resulting `URL` object would be different than what would be created by using `URL.resolve()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl) + parsedUrl.format()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string representations of `parsedBaseUrl` and `parsedUrl`, rather than resolving them against each other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl.resolve(parsedUrl))
```
This would result
