  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that is bound to the `object` context, whereas the original code uses `Q(object)` to get the method and then calls it on the `object` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the method immediately, whereas the original code uses the method as a promise handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the method with an array of arguments, whereas the original code uses the method with a spread of arguments.

DONE.
