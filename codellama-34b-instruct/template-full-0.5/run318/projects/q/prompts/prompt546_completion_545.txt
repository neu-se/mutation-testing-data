  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the generator would be called with `null` as an argument, which would cause the generator to yield a `null` value instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the generator would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which would cause the generator to yield an `undefined` value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the generator would be called with `0` as an argument, which would cause the generator to yield a `0` value instead of the expected value.

DONE.
