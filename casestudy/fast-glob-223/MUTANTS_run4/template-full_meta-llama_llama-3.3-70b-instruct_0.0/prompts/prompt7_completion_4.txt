Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence, potentially leading to incorrect results if the escape symbol appears multiple times in the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, but it uses a regular expression, which could lead to different results if the escape symbol is used in a regular expression context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is found in the string, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence, potentially changing the logic of the `isDynamicPattern` function.

DONE.
