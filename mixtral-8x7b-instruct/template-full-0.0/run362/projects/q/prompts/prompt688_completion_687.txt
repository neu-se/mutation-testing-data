 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value, which may not be the same as the original `this` value when the mutated code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the `this` value of the function to the first argument passed to it, which in this case is `null`. This may cause issues if the function being called relies on the correct `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.anotherFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `anotherFunction` is not defined in the provided code, so attempting to call it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
