Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip every other argument, potentially causing some arguments to be ignored during the processing, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the index, causing an infinite loop since `i` would never reach the termination condition of the loop, leading to a stack overflow or hang.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `i` to the total number of arguments, causing the loop to not execute at all, and thus none of the arguments would be processed, returning the original `read` value unchanged.

DONE.
