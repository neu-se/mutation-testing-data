  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(w)` would return the string representation of the object `w`, whereas `type(w)` would return the type of the object `w` as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.constructor.name` would return the name of the constructor function used to create the object `w`, whereas `type(w)` would return the type of the object `w` as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the object `w`, whereas `type(w)` would return the type of the object `w` as a string.

DONE.
