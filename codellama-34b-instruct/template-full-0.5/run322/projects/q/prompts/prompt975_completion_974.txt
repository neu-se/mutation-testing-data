  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x % 2 === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.filter()` is a method that creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while
