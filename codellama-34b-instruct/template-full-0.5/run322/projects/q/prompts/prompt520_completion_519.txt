  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved, rejected, and notified simultaneously, which is not possible in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved, rejected, and notified simultaneously, which is not possible in the original code.
