  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `name` variable to lowercase, which could cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first character of the `name` variable, which could cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.replace('a', 'b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the first occurrence of the letter 'a' in the `name` variable with the letter 'b', which could cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
