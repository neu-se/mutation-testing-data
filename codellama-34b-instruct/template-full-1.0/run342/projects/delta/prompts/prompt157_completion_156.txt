  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `compose` method would be called even if the next operation in `otherIter` is a delete operation, which would result in an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `compose` method would be called even if the next operation in `thisIter` is a delete operation, which would result in an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method would never be called, and the resulting `retDelta` would be different than expected.

DONE.
