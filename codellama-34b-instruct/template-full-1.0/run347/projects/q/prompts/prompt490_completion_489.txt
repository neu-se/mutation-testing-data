  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would return the promise instead of the resolved value if the `rejected` variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would return the promise instead of the resolved value if the `rejected` variable is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would return the promise instead of the resolved value if the `rejected` variable is not defined.

DONE.
