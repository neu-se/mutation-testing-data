  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This would result in a different behavior because `src.substring(1)` returns a slice of the string starting from the second character, while `src` returns the entire string, which could cause the program to fail if the second character is not a valid path separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in a different behavior because `src.toUpperCase()` returns the uppercase version of the string, while `src` returns the original string, which could cause the program to fail if the file path is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in a different behavior because `src.split('/').pop()` returns the last portion of the path, while `src` returns the entire path, which could cause the program to fail if the last portion is not a valid file or directory name.

DONE.
