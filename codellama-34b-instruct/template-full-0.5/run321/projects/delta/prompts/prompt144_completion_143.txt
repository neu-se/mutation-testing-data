  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(start - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `next` method is called, which could affect the iteration over the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(end - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `next` method is called, which could affect the iteration over the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(index - start);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `next` method is called, which could affect the iteration over the `ops` array.

DONE.
