  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the provided value, which in this case is `this`. This means that the `then` method will always be called on the same object, regardless of how it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `then` method with the `this` context set to `null`. This means that the `then` method will be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `then` method with the `this` context set to `this` and an empty array of arguments. This
