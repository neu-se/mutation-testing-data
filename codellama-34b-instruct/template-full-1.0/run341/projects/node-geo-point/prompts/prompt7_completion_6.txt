  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the original condition, and instead of checking if the point object does not have the "type" property or the "coordinates" property, it would check if the point object has the "type" property but does not have the "coordinates" property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to only check if the point object has both the "type" property and the "coordinates" property, rather than checking if the point object does not have either property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('geometry')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the point object has the "geometry" property, rather than
