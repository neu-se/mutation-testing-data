 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[data, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function has changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `data` would be returned if it is truthy, and `null` otherwise, instead of always returning `null` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the callback function would be `undefined` instead of `data`.

DONE.
