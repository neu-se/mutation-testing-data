  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.fcall()` would be called immediately, whereas `object` would be called only when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.reject()` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `object` would be called only when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(null, callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then(null, callback)` would catch any rejections and pass them to the callback, whereas `object` would not catch any rejections and would pass them on to any subsequent `then` calls.

DONE.
