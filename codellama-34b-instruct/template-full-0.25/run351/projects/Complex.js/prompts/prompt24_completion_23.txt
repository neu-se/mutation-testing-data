  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is a function that takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that takes one argument and returns its square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a function that takes one argument and returns the sine of that argument, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that takes one argument and returns its square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a function that takes one argument and returns the cosine of that argument, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that takes one argument and returns its square root.

DONE.
