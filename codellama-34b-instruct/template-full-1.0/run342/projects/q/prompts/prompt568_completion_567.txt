  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `callback` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the specified reason, whereas `callback` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.failed
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.failed` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the specified reason, whereas `callback` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
