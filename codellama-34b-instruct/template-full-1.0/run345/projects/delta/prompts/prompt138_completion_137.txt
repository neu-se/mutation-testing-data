  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from less than or equal to (`<=`) to less than (`<`). This could cause the loop to terminate one iteration earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from less than or equal to (`<=`) to greater than (`>`). This could cause the loop to iterate one or more additional times before terminating.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() !== firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from less than or equal to (`<=`) to not equal to (`!==`). This could cause the loop to terminate or not terminate at different points.

DONE.
