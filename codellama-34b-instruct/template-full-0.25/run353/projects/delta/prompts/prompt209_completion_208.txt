  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(this.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a different argument, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(other.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a different argument, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
