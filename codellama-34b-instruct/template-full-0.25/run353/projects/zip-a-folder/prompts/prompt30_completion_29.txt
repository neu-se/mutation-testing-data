  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` is not the same as `'close'`, and the callback function `reject` is not the same as `resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'end'` is not the same as `'close'`, and the callback function `resolve` is not the same as `reject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'finish'` is not the same as `'close'`, and the callback function `reject` is not the same as `resolve`.

DONE.
