  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `generate()` is a function call, while `generate` is a reference to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `generate.apply(null, [])` is a function call with an empty array as the argument, while `generate` is a reference to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `generate.bind(null)()` is a function call with `null` as the context, while `generate` is a reference to a function.

DONE.
