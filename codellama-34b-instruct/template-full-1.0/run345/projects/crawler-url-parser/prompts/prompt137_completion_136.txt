  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `replace()` method would only replace the last slash in the URL, instead of all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `replace()` method would not match any slashes in the URL, causing the replacement to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the escape character in the string literal would cause the backslash to be treated as a literal character, instead of an escape character.

DONE.
