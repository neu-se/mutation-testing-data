  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
@deferred.reject@
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, which is not the expected behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
@deferred.resolve(Q(resolver))@
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a promise that is not the result of the `resolver` function, which is not the expected behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
@deferred.notify(resolver)@
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is not intended to be used with the `resolver` function, which is not the expected behavior of the code.

DONE.
