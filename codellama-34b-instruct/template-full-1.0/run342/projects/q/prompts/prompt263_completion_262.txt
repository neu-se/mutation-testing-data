  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` and `fulfill` are inverse methods for changing the state of a promise, and `reject` will instead reject the promise with the value, while `fulfill` will fulfill the promise with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a method for changing the state of a promise, while `fulfill` is a method for fulfilling the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be settled with a value without using any of the standard methods for changing the promise's state.

DONE.
