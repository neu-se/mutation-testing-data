  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a method that applies the callback to the arguments as an array, whereas `fcall` applies the callback to the arguments as a list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `fbind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original callback with a given context and arguments, whereas `fcall` calls the callback immediately with the given context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` calls the callback immediately with the given context and arguments, whereas `fbind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original callback with a given context and arguments.

DONE.
