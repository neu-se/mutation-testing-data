  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not called when it is set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = () => { throw new Error('Reviver error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function throws an error, which is not handled by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = (key, value) => value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function always returns the original value, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
