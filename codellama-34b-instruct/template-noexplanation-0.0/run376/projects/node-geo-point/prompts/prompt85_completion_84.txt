  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use the wrong latitude value when calculating the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use the wrong longitude value when calculating the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use a constant value for the latitude and longitude calculations, which will result in incorrect calculations.

DONE.
