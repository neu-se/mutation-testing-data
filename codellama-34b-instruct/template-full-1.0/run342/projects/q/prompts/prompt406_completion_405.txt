  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause <promise> to be passed to Q.when instead of <value>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the if statement to evaluate to false and the callback would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to occur when attempting to call a method on undefined.

DONE.
