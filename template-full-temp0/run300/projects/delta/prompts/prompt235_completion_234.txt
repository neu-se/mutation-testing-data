  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different operation than the one that was expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different operation than the one that was expected.

DONE.
