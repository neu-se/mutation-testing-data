  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` will replace all occurrences of the search value, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in `replace` is different from the one used in `replaceAll`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in `replace` is different from the one used in `replaceAll`.

DONE.
