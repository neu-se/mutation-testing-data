  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a different method than `obj`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

DONE.
