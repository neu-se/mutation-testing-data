  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.name` is not a Policy object, it's a string, and `this.set()` expects a Policy object as its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid expression and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy != policy
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy != policy` is always false, so `this.set()` would never be called.

DONE.
