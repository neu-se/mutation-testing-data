  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reciprocal of the natural logarithm of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment would return the natural logarithm of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exponential function of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment would return the natural logarithm of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment would return the natural logarithm of the complex number.

DONE.
