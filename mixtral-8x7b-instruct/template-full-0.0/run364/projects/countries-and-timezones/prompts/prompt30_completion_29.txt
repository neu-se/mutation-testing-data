 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the minutes part of the offset string might be rounded down instead of using the original modulo operation to get the minutes part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 * input
```
This would result in different behavior because the minutes part of the offset string would be multiplied by 10 instead of using the original modulo operation to get the minutes part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'getNumStr'
