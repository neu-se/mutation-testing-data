  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (stream !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is truthy, whereas this replacement only checks if it is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (stream === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is truthy, whereas this replacement checks if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (stream.isNull())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is truthy, whereas this replacement calls the `isNull` method on `stream`, which may return a different value.

DONE.
