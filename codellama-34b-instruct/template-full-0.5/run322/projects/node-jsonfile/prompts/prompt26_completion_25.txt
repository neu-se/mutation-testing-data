  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would return `null` instead of the expected object, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the parsed object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would return an empty object instead of the expected object, which would cause the function to return an empty object instead of the parsed object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ "foo": "bar" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would return an object with a single property `foo` instead of the expected object, which would cause the function to return an object with a single property `foo` instead of the parsed object.

DONE.
