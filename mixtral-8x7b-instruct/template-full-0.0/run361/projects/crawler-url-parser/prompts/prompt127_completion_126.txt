 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object, which would cause the `gettype` function to throw a TypeError when trying to access properties of `linkurl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `linkurl` to null, which would cause the `gettype` function to throw a TypeError when trying to access properties of `linkurl`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number, which would cause the `gettype` function to behave unpredictably as it would be comparing a number to a URL string.

DONE.
