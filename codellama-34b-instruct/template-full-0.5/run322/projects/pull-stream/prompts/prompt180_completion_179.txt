  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `!abort` is the negation of that value. If `abort` is true, `!abort` will be false, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort || true` is a boolean expression that will always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort && false` is a boolean expression that will always evaluate to false, regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
