  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `component[1]` would refer to the second element of the `component` array, which may not exist or have a different value than `component[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `component.length` would refer to the length of the `component` array, which may be different from the value of `component[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `component[0] + 1` would refer to the value of the first element of the `component` array plus one, which may not be the same as the value of `component[0]`.

DONE.
