  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an instance of `QueryContext`, and therefore the `rule.query()` method would throw an error if it is passed `undefined` as the third argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an instance of `QueryContext`, and therefore the `rule.query()` method would throw an error if it is passed `null` as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new QueryContext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new QueryContext()` creates a new instance of `QueryContext`, which is not the same as the original `ctx` object that was passed to the `query()` method.

DONE.
