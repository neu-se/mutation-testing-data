  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would always return `false`, even if the `field` value is not unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, field
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would always return the same value as the `field` value, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would add `1` to the `field` value before returning it, which would change the function's behavior.

DONE.
