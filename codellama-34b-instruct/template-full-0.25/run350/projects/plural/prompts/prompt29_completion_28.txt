  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'` to pluralize words that end in -is, while this code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es'` to pluralize words that end in -is. This would cause the pluralization of words like "thesis" and "crisis" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'` to pluralize words that end
