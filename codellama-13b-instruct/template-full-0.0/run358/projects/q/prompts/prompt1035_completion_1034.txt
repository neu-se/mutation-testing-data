  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the `nodeArgs` array to the `bound` object, while the modified code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the `nodeArgs` array to the `bound` object and then calls the `fail` method on the resulting promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the `nodeArgs` array to the `bound` object and then calls the `fail` method on the resulting promise, while the modified code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the `nodeArgs` array to the `bound` object and then calls the `then` method on the resulting promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
