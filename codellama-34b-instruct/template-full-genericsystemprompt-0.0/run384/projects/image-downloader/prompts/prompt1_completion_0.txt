  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value. In the original code, `!options.url` would evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is `undefined`, `null`, or an empty string. However, `options.url === undefined` would only evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a string, and `null` is a primitive value. In the original code, `!options.url` would evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string. However, `options.url === null` would only evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
