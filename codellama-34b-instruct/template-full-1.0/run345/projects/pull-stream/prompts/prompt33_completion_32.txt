  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read => $_
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$_` variable is a special variable in JavaScript that refers to the last argument of the last function call. In this case, it would read the last argument of the `pull` function, which is not intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read => null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a function and cannot be called. Therefore, the `pull` function would return `null` instead of the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read => !read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `read`, so if `read` is a function, it would become `false`, and if `read` is any other value, it would become `true`. This would change the behavior of the `pull` function and potentially cause it to return unexpected results.
