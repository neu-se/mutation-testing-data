  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.INFINITY + 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex.INFINITY` is a valid value, and adding zero to it will not change its value, while the original code fragment will always return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && this['re'] == z['re'] && this['im'] == z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `re` and `im` properties of `this` and `z`, which are not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex.NAI;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `Complex.NAI` when both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the original code fragment would return `Complex.
