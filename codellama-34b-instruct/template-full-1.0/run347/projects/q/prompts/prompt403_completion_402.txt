  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q(promise).thenReject` is a method that rejects an existing promise with a given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenResolve` is a method that resolves an existing promise with a given value, whereas `Q(promise).thenReject` is a method that rejects an existing promise with a given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.finally` is a method that returns a promise that, when resolved, is resolved with the same value as the input promise, whereas `Q(promise).thenReject` is a method that rejects an existing promise with a given reason.

DONE.
