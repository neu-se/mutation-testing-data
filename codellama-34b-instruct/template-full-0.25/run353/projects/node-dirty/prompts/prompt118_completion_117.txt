  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the `'read_error'` event is not the same as the code that handles the `'read_close'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the `'write_error'` event is not the same as the code that handles the `'read_close'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the `'drain'` event is not the same as the code that handles the `'read_close'` event.

DONE.
