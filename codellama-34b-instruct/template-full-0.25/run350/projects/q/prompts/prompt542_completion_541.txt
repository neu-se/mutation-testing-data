  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only spread the first element of the array, rather than all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only spread the elements of the array starting from the second element, rather than all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would spread the array twice, rather than just once.

DONE.
