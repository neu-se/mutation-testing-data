  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always retain the next operation from the `other` delta, regardless of its type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always delete the next operation from the `other` delta, regardless of its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always retain the next operation from the `this` delta, regardless of its type.

DONE.
