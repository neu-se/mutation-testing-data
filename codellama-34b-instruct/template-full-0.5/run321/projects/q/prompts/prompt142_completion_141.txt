  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `promise` is a truthy value, but then assign `undefined` to `p` instead of the `source` property of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `promise` is a truthy value, but then assign the `length` property of `source` instead of the `source` property of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `promise` is a truthy value, but then assign the `prototype` property of `source` instead of the `
