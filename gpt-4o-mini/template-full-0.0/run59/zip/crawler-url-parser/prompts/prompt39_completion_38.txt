Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.protocol || parsedUrl.protocol === 'ftp:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the protocol is either undefined or specifically 'ftp:', which would allow URLs with an 'ftp' protocol to pass through, whereas the original code only allowed 'http' and 'https'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol === 'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the protocol is 'http:', ignoring 'https:', which would cause URLs with 'https' to be incorrectly treated as invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol !== 'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any protocol other than 'http' to pass through, including 'https', which would not be the case in the original code that specifically checks for both 'http' and 'https'.

DONE.
