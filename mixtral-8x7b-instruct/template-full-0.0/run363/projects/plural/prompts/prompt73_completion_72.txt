 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cell', 'cells'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize the word 'cell' as 'cells' instead of 'cells'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cell0', 'cell0s'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new rule that is not present in the original code, which would incorrectly pluralize the word 'cell0' as 'cell0s'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cello', 'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize the word 'cello' as 'cell' instead of 'cellos'.

DONE.
