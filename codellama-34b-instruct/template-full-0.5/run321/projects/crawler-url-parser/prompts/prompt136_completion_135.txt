  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag would cause the regular expression to match case-insensitively, so it would also match URLs that have uppercase letters in the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag would cause the regular expression to match across multiple lines, so it would also match URLs that have a newline character after the file extension.

DONE.
