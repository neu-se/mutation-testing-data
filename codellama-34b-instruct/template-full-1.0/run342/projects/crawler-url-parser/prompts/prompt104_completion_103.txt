  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tmpUrl.text.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` operator negates the logical value of `tmpUrl.text.includes` expression, which was originally checking if `text` property of `tmpUrl` object contains any value. With `!` operator, it would check if `text` property does not contain any value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the intention was to check if `text` property contains any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(" ") != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string. If the value is not found, it returns `-1`. In this example, it would check if `text` property of `tmpUrl` object contains any occurrence of a space character (`" "`). If the `text` property does not contain any space character, the `indexOf()` method would return `-1`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the intention was
