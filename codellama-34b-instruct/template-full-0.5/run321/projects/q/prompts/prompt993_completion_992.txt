  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `defer` function to be called without any arguments, while the modified code calls it with a `null` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `defer` function to be called without any arguments, while the modified code calls it with an `undefined` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `defer` function to be called without any arguments, while the modified code calls it with a `true` argument.

DONE.
