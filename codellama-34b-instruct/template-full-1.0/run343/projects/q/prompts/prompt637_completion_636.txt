  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is not a string.

DONE.
