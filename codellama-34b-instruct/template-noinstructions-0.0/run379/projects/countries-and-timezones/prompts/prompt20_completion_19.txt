  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezone` is strictly equal to `null`. If `timezone` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezone` is not strictly equal to `null`. If `timezone` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof timezone === 'undefined'
```
This would result in
