  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, while this replacement is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call with a string literal as its second argument, while this replacement is a function call with an anonymous function as its second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call with a string literal as its second argument, while this replacement is a function call with an anonymous function as its second argument that modifies the input string.

DONE.
