  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method would return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `next()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method would return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `next()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method would return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `next()` method.

DONE.
