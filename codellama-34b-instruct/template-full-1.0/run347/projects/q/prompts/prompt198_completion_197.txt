  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is truthy, while replacing it with `return 0;` would cause the function to always return `false`, even when `fileNameAndLineNumber` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fileNameAndLineNumber || !lineNumber;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is not equal to `undefined`, while replacing it with `!fileNameAndLineNumber || !lineNumber;` would cause the function to also check if `lineNumber` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length !== 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is not equal to `undefined`, while replacing it with `fileNameAndLineNumber.length !== 2;` would cause
