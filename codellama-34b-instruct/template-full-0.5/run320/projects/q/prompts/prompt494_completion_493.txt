  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` is a parameter passed to the `rejected` callback, which would be undefined in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` is a parameter passed to the `rejected` callback, which would be null in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some error message"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` is a parameter passed to the `rejected` callback, which would be a string in this case.

DONE.
