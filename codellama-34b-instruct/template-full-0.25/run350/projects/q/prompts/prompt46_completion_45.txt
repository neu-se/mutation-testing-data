  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit()` would terminate the process immediately, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the code in the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the code to jump to the `catch` block, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the code in the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log()` would print a message to the console, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the code in the `if` block.

DONE.
