  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value passed to the `thenResolve` method, while this modified code fragment returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value passed to the `thenResolve` method, while this modified code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value passed to the `thenResolve` method, while this modified code fragment returns `0`.

DONE.
