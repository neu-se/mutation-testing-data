  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`), while this new code fragment uses the abstract equality operator (`==`). This could cause the function to return different values in certain cases, such as when `err` is a non-null object that is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check whether `err` is strictly equal to `false`, while this new code fragment does. This could cause the function to return different values in certain cases, such as when `err` is a non-null object that is not strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`), while this new code
