  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with a null value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with an undefined value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that rejects with a "Test error" message, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
