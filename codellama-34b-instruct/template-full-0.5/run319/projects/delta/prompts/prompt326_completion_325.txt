  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` and `op.delete` are different properties of the `op` object, and the code is checking the value of `op.delete` specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different property of the `op` object than `op.delete`, and the code is checking the value of `op.delete` specifically.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is a different property of the `op` object than `op.delete`, and the code is checking the value of `op.delete` specifically.

DONE.
