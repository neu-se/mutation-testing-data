  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately emit the 'load' event with a size of 0, rather than waiting for the data to be loaded from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'load' event with the correct size of the data, rather than waiting for the data to be loaded from the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'load' event with a size that is one greater than the correct size of the data, which could cause issues with the rest of the code.

DONE.
