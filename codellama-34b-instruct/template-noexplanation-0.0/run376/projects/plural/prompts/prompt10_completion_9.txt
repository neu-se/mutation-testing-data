  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/g
```
This change will make the regular expression match the "quy" ending in a global manner, instead of just the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i
```
This change will make the regular expression case-insensitive, so it will match "quy" regardless of the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This change will remove the "i" flag from the regular expression, making it case-sensitive.

DONE.
