  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && data !== null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `data !== null` would cause the function to return `false` for `null` values, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) || data === null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `data === null` would cause the function to return `true` for `null` values, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) || data.length === 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `data.length === 0` would cause the function to return `true` for empty strings, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

DONE.
