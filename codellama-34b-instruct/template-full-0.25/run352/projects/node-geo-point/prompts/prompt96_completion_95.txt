  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point using a different formula, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point using a different formula, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * tanφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point using a different formula, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
