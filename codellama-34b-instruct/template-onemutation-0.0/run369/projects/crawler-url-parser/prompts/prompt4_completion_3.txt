  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `currentUrlStr` contains illegal characters, rather than `false` as intended.

DONE.
