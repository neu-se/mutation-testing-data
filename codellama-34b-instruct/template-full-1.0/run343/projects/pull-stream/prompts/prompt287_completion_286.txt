  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input data without modification, while the mutated code fragment returns the input data plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input data without modification, while the mutated code fragment returns the input data multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input data without modification, while the mutated code fragment returns the length of the input data.

DONE.
