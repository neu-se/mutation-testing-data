  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, "INVALID")
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument "INVALID" would cause the `buildCountry` function to return `undefined`, which would then be assigned to `countries[id]`. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return `undefined` for any country ID, even if the country exists in the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object for any country ID, even if the country exists in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
