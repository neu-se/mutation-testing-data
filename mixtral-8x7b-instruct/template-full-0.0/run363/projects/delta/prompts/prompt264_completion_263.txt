 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of using the original ones, potentially causing issues with object references in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...thisOp.attributes, ...otherOp.attributes]
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the attributes objects into arrays of key-value pairs, which might not be compatible with the rest of the code and cause tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.attributes.concat(otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the attributes objects as if they were arrays, which is not the same as merging them. This could cause issues in the test suite if the code expects merged attributes instead.

DONE.
