  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this.ops.length === other.ops```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the ops array instead of checking for reference equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this.length === other.length```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the string representaion of the ops array instead of checking for reference equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this.ops.every((item, index) => item === other.ops[index])```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if every item in the ops array is equal to the corresponding item in the other ops array, instead of checking for reference equality.

DONE.
