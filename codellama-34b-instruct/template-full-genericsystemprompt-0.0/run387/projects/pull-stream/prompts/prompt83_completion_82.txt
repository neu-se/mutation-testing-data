  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () { throw new Error('done callback not supplied') })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with a different set of arguments, and if the `done` callback is not supplied, it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () { console.warn('done callback not supplied') })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with a different set of arguments, and if the `done` callback is not supplied, it would log a warning message to the console.

DONE.
