  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` is a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value that is determined by the `PLACEHOLDER` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("some error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("some error"))` is a rejected promise with an error message of "some error", whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value that is determined by the `PLACEHOLDER` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` is a pending promise that
