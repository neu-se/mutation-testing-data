Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'retain' when `op` is falsy (null, undefined, etc.), which could lead to incorrect type identification for valid operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'retain' for any operation that is not explicitly null, potentially misclassifying valid operations as 'retain' when they should be classified based on their actual properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'retain' for any non-primitive type, which could incorrectly classify operations that are valid but not objects, leading to incorrect handling of operations.

DONE.
