  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the list of unhandled rejections, potentially hiding bugs in the code that is testing for unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would empty the list of unhandled rejections, potentially hiding bugs in the code that is testing for unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable tracking of unhandled rejections, potentially hiding bugs in the code that is testing for unhandled rejections.

DONE.
