  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers the first element of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment considers all elements of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment does not consider the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] + point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the sum of the first two elements of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment considers all elements of the array.

DONE.
