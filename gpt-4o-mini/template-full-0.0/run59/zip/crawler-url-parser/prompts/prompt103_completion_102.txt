Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.startsWith(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `tmpUrl.text` starts with `text`, which is a different condition than checking if `tmpUrl.text` does not include `text`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `tmpUrl.text` is empty, which would not account for cases where `text` is present but not included in `tmpUrl.text`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.includes(tmpUrl.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `text` includes `tmpUrl.text`, which is the opposite of the original condition and would lead to different outcomes in the logic.

DONE.
