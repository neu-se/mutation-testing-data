Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of the `arguments` object, which creates a shallow copy of the entire `arguments` object instead of converting it to an array, potentially leading to unexpected results when the function is called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from(arguments)` creates a new array from the `arguments` object, which may not behave the same way as `array_slice` if `array_slice` has specific handling for array-like objects or if it has additional logic that is not replicated by `Array.from`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `[].concat(arguments)` will create a new array that contains the `arguments` object as a single element, rather than spreading the elements of `arguments` into the new array, which could lead to incorrect handling of the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
