  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` expects an iterable object as its argument, but `urlMap.values()` returns a `MapIterator` object, which is not iterable. Using `Array.from` on a `MapIterator` object would result in an empty array, which would cause the `for` loop to not execute and the `retArr` variable to be empty.

DONE.
