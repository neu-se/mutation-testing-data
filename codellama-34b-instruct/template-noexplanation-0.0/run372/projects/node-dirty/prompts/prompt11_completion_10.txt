  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key) || []
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `||` operator to return an empty array if the value of `this._queue.get(key)` is falsy. This can help to ensure that the `cbs` variable is always an array, even if the `this._queue.get(key)` method returns a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key) || this._queue.set(key, [])
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `||` operator to set the value of `this._queue.get(key)` to an empty array if it is falsy. This can help to ensure that the `cbs` variable is always an array, even if the `this._queue.get(key)` method returns a falsy value.
