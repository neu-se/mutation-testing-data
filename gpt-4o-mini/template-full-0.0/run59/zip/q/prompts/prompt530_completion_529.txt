Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(object).inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to reject the `object` instead of inspecting it, which would lead to a promise being rejected rather than returning the inspection result of the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `inspect` method on the `object`, which may not return a promise and could lead to unexpected results if `object` does not have an `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `object` in a promise using `Q`, which changes the context of the `inspect` call, potentially altering the output if `Q` modifies the behavior of the `object`.

DONE.
