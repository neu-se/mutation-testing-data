```
this.verbs = {'GET': true, 'POST': true, 'PUT': false, 'DELETE': false, 'OPTIONS': true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the values of the `verbs` object, whereas the original code uses the `verbs` variable to store the values that are passed in through the constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs = {'*': true}
