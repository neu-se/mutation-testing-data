  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "name" instead of the actual name of the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the name of the policy in uppercase instead of the actual name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the name of the policy without the first character instead of the actual name.

DONE.
