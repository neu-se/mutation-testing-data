  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `Number.isFinite`, potentially causing the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed even if the input is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] !== NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NaN` value is not equivalent to the result of the `Number.isFinite` method, which checks for finiteness.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] !== Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` value is not equivalent to the result of the `Number.isFinite` method, which checks for finiteness.

DONE.
