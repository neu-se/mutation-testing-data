  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the `basis` variable, which is used in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of the `basis` variable, which is used in the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be used in the subsequent calculations, which would likely cause errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
