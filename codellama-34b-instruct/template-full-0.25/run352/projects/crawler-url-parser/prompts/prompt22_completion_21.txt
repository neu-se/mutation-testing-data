  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "https", which could cause the URL to be treated differently by the server or the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "ftp", which could cause the URL to be treated differently by the server or the client.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "file", which could cause the URL to be treated differently by the server or the client.

DONE.
