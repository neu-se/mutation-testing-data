 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for equality instead of greater than, potentially causing the function to return true or execute the callback with the `end` parameter when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for greater than or equal to, potentially causing the function to return true or execute the callback with the `end` parameter when it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 > max
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the value of `i` before the comparison, potentially causing the function to return true or execute the callback with the `end` parameter when it shouldn't.

DONE.
