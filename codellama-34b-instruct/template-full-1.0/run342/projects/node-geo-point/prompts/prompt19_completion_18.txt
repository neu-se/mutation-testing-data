  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` is a function that checks if a variable is an object, while `!isObject` is the negation of that function, which would result in wrongly assuming that a variable is an object when it's not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` and `isArray` are two different functions with different purposes. Using `isArray` instead of `isObject` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when it encounters an array, which would break the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` is a method that checks if a variable is an array, while `isObject` checks if a variable is an object. Using `Array.isArray` instead of `isObject` would cause the code to throw
