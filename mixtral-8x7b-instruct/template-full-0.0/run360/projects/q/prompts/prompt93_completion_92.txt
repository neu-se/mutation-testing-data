 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the length of the array is 0, it will throw a TypeError when trying to access the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always use 1 as the basis for the reduction, regardless of the contents of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the second argument passed to the function as the basis for the reduction, instead of the first value in the array.

DONE.
