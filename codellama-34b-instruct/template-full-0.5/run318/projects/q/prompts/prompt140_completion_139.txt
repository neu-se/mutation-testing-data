  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would return `true` if `p` is falsy, and `false` if `p` is truthy. In contrast, the original code fragment `!!p` uses the double NOT operator to convert `p` to a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, while the original code fragment `!!p` uses the NOT operator to convert `p` to a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, while the original code fragment `!!p` uses the NOT operator to convert `p` to a boolean value.

DONE.
