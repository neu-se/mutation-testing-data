  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2` is a valid index for the `props` array, while the original code fragment `1` is not a valid index. This would cause the `props` array to be accessed out of bounds, which could result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `props[0]` expression would return the first element of the `props` array, while the original code fragment `1` would return the number `1`. This could result in different behavior if the `props` array is not empty and the first element is not the number `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `props.length` expression would return the length of the `props` array, while the original code fragment `1` would return the number `1`. This could result in different behavior if the
