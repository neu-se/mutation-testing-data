  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, without modifying the original array, whereas `baseArgs.concat` returns a new array, with the given values at the beginning of the new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(baseArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method combines two or more arrays and returns a new combined array without modifying any of the original arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(baseArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(baseArgs)` returns a new array consisting of the elements from both arrays, where `baseArgs` is concatenated to `args` as a new array.

DONE.
