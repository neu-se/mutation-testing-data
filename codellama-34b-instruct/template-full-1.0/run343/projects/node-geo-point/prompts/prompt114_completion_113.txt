  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the result of the trigonometric function `cos()`, which is a non-trivial mathematical operation, whereas `1+1` simply adds two numbers together, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin()` is a different trigonometric function than `cos()`, and would produce a different output given the same input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `PI` is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, whereas the original code uses the result of the `cos()` function, which is a non-trivial mathematical operation.

DONE.
