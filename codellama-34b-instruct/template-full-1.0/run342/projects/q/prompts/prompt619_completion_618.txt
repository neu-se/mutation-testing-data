  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called as `set` instead, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called with an empty array as the argument, instead of the key, which would also cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called as a property of the `Q` object, which would be invalid and would cause an error.

DONE.
