  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replaceAll(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the JavaScript `replaceAll()` method will replace all occurrences of the search string, not just the first occurrence as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the JavaScript `replace()` method will replace only the first occurrence of the search string, not all occurrences as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(new RegExp('^' + regex.source + '$', 'i'), 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the JavaScript `new RegExp()` constructor creates a new regular expression that matches the pattern of the original regular expression but only at the beginning of the string, not anywhere in the string.

DONE.
