  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and use the second argument as the array of arguments to pass to the `nodeArgs` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments and use the remaining arguments as the array of arguments to pass to the `nodeArgs` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use only the first two arguments as the array of arguments to pass to the `nodeArgs` variable.

DONE.
