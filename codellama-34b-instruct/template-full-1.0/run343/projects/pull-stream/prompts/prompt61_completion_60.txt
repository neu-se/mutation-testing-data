  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would now be `false` if `abort` is `true`, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort || end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would now be `true` if `abort` is `true`, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would now be `false` if `abort` is `true`, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely.

DONE.
