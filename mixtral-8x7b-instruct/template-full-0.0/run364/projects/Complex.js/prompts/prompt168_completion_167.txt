 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `z` is a finite complex number, causing the division result to be `Complex['ZERO']` regardless of the denominator's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the real part of `z` is zero, which may not be the case when `z` is an infinite complex number. This could lead to incorrect results in the division operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `z` has an `isZero()` method, which is not the case in the original code. This would cause a `TypeError` if the method is not found, leading to a test failure.

DONE.
