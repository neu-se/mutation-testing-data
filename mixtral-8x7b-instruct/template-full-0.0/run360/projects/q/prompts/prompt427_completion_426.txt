 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return false, regardless of the input. This is because the short-circuit OR operator (`||`) would always return the falsy value `false` instead of evaluating the expression on its right side.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return the number `0`, regardless of the input. This is because the short-circuit OR operator (`||`) would always return the first truthy value it encounters, which in this case is the number `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return `null`, regardless of the input. This is because the short-circuit OR operator (`||`) would always return the first truthy
