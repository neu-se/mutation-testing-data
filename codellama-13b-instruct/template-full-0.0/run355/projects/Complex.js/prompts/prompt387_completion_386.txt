  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(2 * a)` is a constant, while the new code fragment `cosh(2 * a)` is a function call. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the function `cosh` is not properly tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(2 * a)` is a constant, while the new code fragment `Math.cos(2 * a)` is a function call. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the function `Math.cos` is not properly tested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(2 * a)` is a constant, while the new code fragment `sinh(2 *
