  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `type` returns a string representation of the object's type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `type.slice(1)` returns a substring of the type string, starting from the second character, while `type` returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof type
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof type` returns the type of the `type` object, which is a string, while `type` returns the string representation of the object's type.

DONE.
