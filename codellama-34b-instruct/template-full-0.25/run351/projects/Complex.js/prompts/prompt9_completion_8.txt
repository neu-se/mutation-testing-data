  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and output values, which could cause the calculation of `cosm1` to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and output values, which could cause the calculation of `cosm1` to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and output values, which could cause the calculation of `cosm1` to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
