  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 

```
coordinate.longitude + 180;
```

This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude value, which is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
coordinate.latitude + 90;
```

This would result in different behavior because it would add 90 degrees to the latitude value, which is also not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
coordinate.latitude + coordinate.longitude;
```

This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude and longitude values together, which would not give the correct value.

DONE.
