 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would always be called, even when there are more than 2 arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called when there is at least 1 argument, instead of at least 3 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would never be called, and the error would always be rejected.

DONE.
