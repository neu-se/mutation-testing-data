  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit(1)` would force the program to exit with a non-zero status code, indicating an error, whereas `parser_exit` would simply exit the program without indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit(0)` would force the program to exit with a zero status code, indicating success, whereas `parser_exit` would simply exit the program without indicating success or failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit(2)` would force the program to exit with a status code of 2, indicating a specific error condition, whereas `parser_exit` would simply exit the program without indicating the specific error condition.

DONE.
