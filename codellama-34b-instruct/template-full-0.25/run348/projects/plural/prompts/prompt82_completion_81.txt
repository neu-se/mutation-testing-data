  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "mouse," while this code fragment adds the plural "ses" to the word "mouse."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "mouse," while this code fragment adds the plural "ice" to the word "mouse."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mous')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural "s" to the word "mouse," while this code fragment removes the final "e" from the word "mouse" and adds the plural "s" to the resulting word "mous."

DONE.
