  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isEqual()` function checks if two values are not equal in a way that is consistent with the language's Equality Comparison specification, while the `!=` operator checks for inequality based on memory references.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.is(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.is()` checks for equality based on memory references, while `!isEqual()` checks for inequality based on the language's Equality Comparison specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.deepEqual(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.deepEqual()` checks for both deep equality and inequality based on the language's Equality Comparison specification, while `!isEqual()` only checks for inequality.

DONE.
