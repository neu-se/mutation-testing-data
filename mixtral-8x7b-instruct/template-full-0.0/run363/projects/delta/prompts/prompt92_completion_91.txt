 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow pushing the `newOp` even when it should be appended to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent pushing the `newOp` when the length is equal to the array length, even though it should be appended to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index === this.ops.length - 1
