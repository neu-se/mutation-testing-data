  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.define
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `define` is a function and if `define.amd` exists, while the modified code fragment also checks if `define.amd.define` exists. If `define.amd.define` does not exist, the modified code fragment would return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.
