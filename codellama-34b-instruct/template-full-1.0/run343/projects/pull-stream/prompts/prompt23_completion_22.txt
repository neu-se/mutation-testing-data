  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[i]` would refer to the i-th element of the `ref` array, while originally it referred to the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length - 1]` would refer to the last element of the `ref` array, while originally it referred to the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[i + 1]` would refer to the element at position `i + 1` of the `ref` array, while originally it referred to the first element.

DONE.
