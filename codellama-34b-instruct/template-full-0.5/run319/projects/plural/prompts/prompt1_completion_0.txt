  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the string from the beginning to the end, while this new code fragment slices the string from the beginning to the second-to-last character. This would cause the plural function to return incorrect results for words that end in "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the string from the beginning to the end, while this new code fragment slices the string from the second character to the end. This would cause the plural function to return incorrect results for words that start with a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment s
