  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(Δλ)` would be a different value than `cos(Δλ)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)^2
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)^2` is different from `cos(φ1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos(r)` is the inverse of `cos(Δλ)`.

The correct answer is option 3, which replaces the placeholder with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment. The `acos(r)` function returns the arccosine of the argument, which is different from the sine of the argument. This would result in different behavior in the rest of the calculation, causing the final result to be incorrect.

DONE.
