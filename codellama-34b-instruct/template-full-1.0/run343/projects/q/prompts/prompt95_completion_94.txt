  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the first element of the array, since the indexing starts at 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index >= length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always include one extra element in the slice, since it uses the length instead of the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index < length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the last element of the array, since the indexing starts at 0.

DONE.
