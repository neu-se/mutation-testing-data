  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This change will cause the `closed` promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error)
```
This change will cause the `closed` promise to be resolved with the `error` object instead of the original code, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This change will cause the `closed` promise to be resolved with a new error object instead of the original code, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
