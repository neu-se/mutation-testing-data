  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype.fcall` method uses the `apply` method to invoke the function, but the mutated code would use the `call` method instead, which would result in a different way of resolving the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype.fbind` method uses the `apply` method to invoke the function, but the mutated code would use the `bind` method instead, which would result in a different way of resolving the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"catch"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype.fcall` method uses the `try` method to handle errors, but the mutated code would use the `catch` method instead, which would result in a different error-handling mechanism.

DONE.
