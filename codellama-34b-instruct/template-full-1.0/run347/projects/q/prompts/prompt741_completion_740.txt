  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would resolve the promise with no value, while the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would reject the promise with no reason, while the original code fragment would reject the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` would notify subscribers of the promise's progress, but not resolve or reject the promise.

DONE.
