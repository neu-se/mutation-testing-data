  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'warning'`, which may not trigger the same error handling logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'info'`, which may not trigger the same error handling logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'debug'`, which may not trigger the same error handling logic.

DONE.
