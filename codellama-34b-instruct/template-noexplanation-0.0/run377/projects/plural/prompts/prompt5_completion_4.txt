  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This code fragment is a function that returns a bound function, which is a function that has been bound to a specific context. In this case, the context is the `Object.prototype.toString` function. This can be useful for creating a function that can be used to check the type of an object, without having to specify the object as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString, Object.prototype)
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but it binds the `Object.prototype.toString` function to the `Object.prototype` object. This can be useful for creating a function that can be used to check the type of an object, without having to specify the object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString
