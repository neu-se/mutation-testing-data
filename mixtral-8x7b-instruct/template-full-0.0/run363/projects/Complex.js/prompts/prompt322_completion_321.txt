 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the real part of the complex number, instead of the original code which uses the input variable 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2) * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the square root of 2 times the input variable 'a', instead of the original code which uses 2 times 'a'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the absolute value of the input variable 'a', instead of the original code which uses the input variable 'a' directly.

DONE.
