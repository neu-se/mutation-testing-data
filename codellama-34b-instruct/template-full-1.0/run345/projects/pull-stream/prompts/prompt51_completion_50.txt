  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Read
```
This would result in different behavior because "Read" is a reserved word in JavaScript and cannot be used as a variable name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "read" variable as both an object and a function, while this code fragment only uses it as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function read() { return s }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "s" variable as a function, while this code fragment defines it as a new function that always returns the "s" variable.

DONE.
