  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the next operation is an insert operation, rather than a delete operation. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the next operation is actually an insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the next operation is not a delete operation, rather than checking if it is a delete operation. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the next operation is actually a retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the next operation is a retain operation, rather than checking if it is a delete operation. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the next operation is actually an insert
