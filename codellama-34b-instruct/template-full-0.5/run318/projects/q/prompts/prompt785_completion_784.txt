  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled instead of rejected, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called.

DONE.
