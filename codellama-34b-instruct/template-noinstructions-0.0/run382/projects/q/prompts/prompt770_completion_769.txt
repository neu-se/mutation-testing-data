  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current promise, while `null` would refer to the global object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current promise, while `undefined` would refer to the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current promise, while `{}` would refer to a new empty object.

DONE.
