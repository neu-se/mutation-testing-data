  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment `drain` in that it pipes the output of the `drain` function to the `process.stdout` stream, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment `drain` in that it pipes the output of the `drain` function to the `process.stderr` stream, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(null)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment `drain` in that it pipes the output of the `drain` function to `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
