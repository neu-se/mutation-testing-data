  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the value of `x`, it would resolve it with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x++
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the value of `x`, it would resolve it with the value of `x` incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the value of `x`, it would resolve it with the `x` property of the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the current code.

DONE.
