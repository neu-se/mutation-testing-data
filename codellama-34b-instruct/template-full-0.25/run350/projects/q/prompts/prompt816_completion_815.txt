  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a different method than `done`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a rejection reason, instead of resolved.

DONE.
