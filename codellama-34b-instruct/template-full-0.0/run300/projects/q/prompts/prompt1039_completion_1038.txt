  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the error, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `closed` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code fragment would resolve the promise with `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `closed` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code
