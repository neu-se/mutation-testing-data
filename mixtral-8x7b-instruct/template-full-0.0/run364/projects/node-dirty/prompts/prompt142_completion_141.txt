 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would not be propagated to the callback function, and the `emit('error')` call would not have any effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would not be the same object as the one emitted by the `emit('error')` call, and it would not have the `code` property set to 'ENOENT'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Another error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and it would not indicate that the file does not exist.

DONE.
