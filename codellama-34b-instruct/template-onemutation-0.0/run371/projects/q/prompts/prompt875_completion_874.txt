  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a node-style callback, which is then passed to `setTimeout`. However, the modified code fragment uses `deferred.reject` directly, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than after the timeout period.
