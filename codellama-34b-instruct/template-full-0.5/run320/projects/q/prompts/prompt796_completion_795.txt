  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(progressed, void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called twice, once for the fulfillment and once for the rejection, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(progressed, void 0, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would not be called for the rejection, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(progressed, void 0, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called for the rejection, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
