  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is `1`, but in the mutated code, it is `2`. This could cause the function to access the wrong element in the array, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is `1`, but in the mutated code, it is `0`. This could cause the function to access the wrong element in the array, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is `1`, but in the mutated code, it is `length - 1`. This could cause the function to
