  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a value to be passed to the `rejected` callback, while this change would pass `undefined` instead, leading to unexpected behavior if the calling code relies on the presence of that value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a truthy value to be passed to the `rejected` callback, while this change would pass `null` instead, which is a falsy value. This could cause the calling code to not handle the rejection correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a reason to be passed to the `rejected` callback, while this change would pass a string `'error'` instead. This could cause the calling code to not handle the rejection correctly.

DONE.
