  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = b[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`, even if `a[key]` is already defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = b[key] || a[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`, but only if `b[key]` is truthy. If `b[key]` is falsy, it would leave `a[key]` unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = b[key] && a[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`, but only if `b[key]` is truthy and `a[key]` is already defined. If `b[
