  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a promise to be returned, but by replacing it with a constant value, the promise chain would be broken and the error handler would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a promise to be returned, but by replacing it with a null value, the promise chain would be broken and the error handler would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a promise to be returned, but by replacing it with an undefined value, the promise chain would be broken and the error handler would not be triggered.

DONE.
