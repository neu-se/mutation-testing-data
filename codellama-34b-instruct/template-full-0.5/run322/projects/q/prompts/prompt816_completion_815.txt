  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual completion of the original promise, whereas `done` is a method that handles the resolution or rejection of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles the rejection of a promise, whereas `done` is a method that handles the resolution or rejection of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that is used to specify a cleanup function that is called when the promise is either fulfilled or rejected, whereas `done` is a method that handles the resolution or rejection of a promise.

DONE.
