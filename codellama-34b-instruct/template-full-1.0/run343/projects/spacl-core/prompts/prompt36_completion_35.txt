  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(part => part.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the characters within each part of the path, potentially causing the matcher to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).filter(part => part === ':id')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include parts of the path that match the string ':id', potentially reducing the number of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(part => part.split('-').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the parts of the path, and then split each part on the '-' character and reverse the resulting array, potentially causing the matcher to fail.

DONE.
