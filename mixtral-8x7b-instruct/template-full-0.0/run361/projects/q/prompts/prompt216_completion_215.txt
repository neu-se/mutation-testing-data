 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would return `false` for `null`, and the `Q` function would return a newly created promise instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would return `true` for an empty object, and the `Q` function would return the empty object wrapped in a promise instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would return `true` for a function, and the `Q` function would return the function wrapped in a promise instead of the original value.

DONE.
