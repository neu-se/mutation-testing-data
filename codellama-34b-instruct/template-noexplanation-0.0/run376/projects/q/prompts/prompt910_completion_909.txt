  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This change will cause the `baseArgs` array to include one more argument than it should, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `nfbind` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This change will cause the `baseArgs` array to include no arguments, which could lead to errors in the `nfbind` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This change will cause the `baseArgs` array to include one fewer argument than it should, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `nfbind` function.

DONE.
