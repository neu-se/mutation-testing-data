  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to resolve with a string value, rather than the timeout value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to resolve with a null value, rather than the timeout value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
    throw new Error("hello");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to reject with a new error, rather than the timeout.
