  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be updated with the result of the `reducer` function, but the `sink` variable would not be updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.write(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` variable is a writable stream, and calling `write` on it would write the data to the stream, but the `acc` variable would not be updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
sink.write(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `acc` variable and the `sink` variable would be updated, but the `sink` variable would be updated with the result of the `reducer` function, rather than the original data.

DONE.
