  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => { throw new Error('Something went wrong'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a custom error message instead of the original error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => { return 'Something went wrong'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a string instead of an error object, which would cause the promise to resolve with a string value instead of rejecting.

DONE.
