  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the index variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the index variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the index variable would be incremented by 2, which would cause the loop to iterate over every other element in the array.

DONE.
