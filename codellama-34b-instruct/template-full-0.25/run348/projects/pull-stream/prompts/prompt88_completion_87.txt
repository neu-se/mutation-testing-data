  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is a different property than `prop`, and may not exist or have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` is a different value than `prop`, and may not be a valid property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.bar` is a different property than `prop`, and may not exist or have a different value.

DONE.
