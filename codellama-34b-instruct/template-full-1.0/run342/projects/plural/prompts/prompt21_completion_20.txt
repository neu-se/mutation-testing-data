  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not change the word "cactus" to its plural form, "cactuses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would add an extra "s" to every word that matches the regular expression, including "cactus", which would result in "cactusses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1)
