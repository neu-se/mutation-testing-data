  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 300 is a redirect, and the original code would not handle redirects properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 404 is a not found error, and the original code would not handle this error properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 500
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 500 is a server error, and the original code would not handle this error properly.

DONE.
