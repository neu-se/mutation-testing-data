  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different operation than "get", and would lead to unintended consequences when attempting to retrieve a property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because "del" is a different operation than "get", and would lead to unintended consequences when attempting to retrieve a property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"when"
```
This would result in different behavior because "when" is a different operation than "get", and would lead to unintended consequences when attempting to retrieve a property value.

DONE.
