  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` would return a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` would return a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would return a resolved promise with the value `exception`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Unexpected error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` would return a rejected promise with the value `exception`, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise with the value `new Error("Unexpected error")`.

DONE.
