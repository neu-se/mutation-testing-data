  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run an additional iteration and potentially apply the callback to additional non-existent array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip the last iteration and potentially miss applying the callback to the last array element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to increment the index variable prematurely and potentially apply the callback to the wrong array element.

DONE.
