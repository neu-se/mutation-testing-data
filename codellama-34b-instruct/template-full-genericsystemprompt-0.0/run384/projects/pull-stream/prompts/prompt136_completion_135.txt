  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `err` object to the `cb` function, while the mutated code fragment would pass `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `err` object to the `cb` function, while the mutated code fragment would pass `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `err` object to the `cb` function, while the mutated code fragment would pass a new `Error` object instead.

DONE.
