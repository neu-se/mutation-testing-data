 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * Math.log(Math.abs(z))
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers the magnitude of the complex number, not the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * loh + z['re'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the same formula as the original, but with incorrect variable names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the real and imaginary parts of the input instead of subtracting them.

DONE.
