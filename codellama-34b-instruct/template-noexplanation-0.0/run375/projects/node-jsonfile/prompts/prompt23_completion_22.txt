  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return a new string that is a slice of the original `content` string, starting from the second character. This change will cause the `stripBom` function to receive a different input, which may result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This code fragment will return a new string that is the original `content` string converted to uppercase. This change will cause the `stripBom` function to receive a different input, which may result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This code fragment will return an array of strings, where each string is a single character from the original `content` string. This change will cause the `stripBom` function to receive a different input, which may result in a different output.

DONE.
