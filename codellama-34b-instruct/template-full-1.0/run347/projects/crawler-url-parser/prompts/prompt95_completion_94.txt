  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass in the URL object itself instead of just the string containing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol + "//" + baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass in the protocol and hostname of the URL, but not the path or query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass in a null value, which would likely cause the parse function to throw an error.

DONE.
