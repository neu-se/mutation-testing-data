  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones + options
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` operator will concatenate the values of the `timezones` and `options` objects, whereas the original code uses the comma operator to return a single object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.concat(options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method will merge the two arrays, whereas the original code returns a single array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.push(options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` method will add the `options` object to the end of the `timezones` array, whereas the original code returns a single object.

DONE.
