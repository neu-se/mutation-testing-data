  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not defined on the `process` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not defined on the `process` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.on("unhandledRejection", function (reason, promise) {
    // do something with the reason and promise
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method is not defined on the `process` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
