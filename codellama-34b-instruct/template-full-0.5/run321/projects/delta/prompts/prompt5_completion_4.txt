  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because `keepNull` is always truthy, whereas `!keepNull` is only truthy when `keepNull` is falsy. This means that the `if` statement would always execute with this change, even if `keepNull` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull || !a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!keepNull || !a[key]` is only truthy when `keepNull` is falsy or `a[key]` is falsy. This means that the `if` statement would only execute when `keepNull` is falsy or `a[key]` is falsy, whereas `!keepNull` is always truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull && a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `keepNull && a[key]` is only truthy when
