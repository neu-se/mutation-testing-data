  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `undefined` is not a promise, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in the modified code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `null` is not a promise, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in the modified code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `"foo"` is a string, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in the modified code.

DONE.
