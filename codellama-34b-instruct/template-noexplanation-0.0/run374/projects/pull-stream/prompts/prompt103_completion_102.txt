  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This change will cause the `console.log` statement to log the value of `data` plus 1, which is different from the original behavior of logging the value of `data` as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This change will cause the `console.log` statement to log the value of `data` multiplied by 2, which is different from the original behavior of logging the value of `data` as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This change will cause the `console.log` statement to log the length of the `data` array, which is different from the original behavior of logging the value of `data` as is.

DONE.
