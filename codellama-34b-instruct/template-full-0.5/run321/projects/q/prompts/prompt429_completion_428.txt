  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object` instead of accessing the `inspect` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object` with an empty argument list, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object` with an empty argument list, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
