  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element instead of adding the element to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the array instead of adding the element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.sort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sort the elements in the array instead of adding the element to the end.

DONE.
