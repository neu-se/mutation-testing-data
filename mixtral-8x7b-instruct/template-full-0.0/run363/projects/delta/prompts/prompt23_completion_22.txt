 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string 'key' as the key, instead of using the variable `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `b[key]` instead of `a[key]`. This could lead to incorrect results when `b[key]` is not equal to `a[key]` but `a[key]` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to `null` when the keys are not equal, regardless of the original value in `b`. This could lead to loss of information if the original value is not `null`.

DONE.
