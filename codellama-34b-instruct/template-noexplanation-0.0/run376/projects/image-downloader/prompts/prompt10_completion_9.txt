  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This code fragment will return the last segment of the `options.dest` path, which may not be the same as the filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').shift()
```
This code fragment will return the first segment of the `options.dest` path, which may not be the same as the filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').slice(-2).join('/')
```
This code fragment will return the last two segments of the `options.dest` path, which may not be the same as the filename.

DONE.
