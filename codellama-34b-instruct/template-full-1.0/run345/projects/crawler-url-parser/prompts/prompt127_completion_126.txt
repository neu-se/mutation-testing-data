  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl` is achead of`jQuery`object, which has a different behavior when accessed using `href` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl` is an array of `jQuery`objects, and we are referencing the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.find('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl` is an `jQuery`object, and `find('a')` method will search for all `a` elements within the `linkurl` element.

DONE.
