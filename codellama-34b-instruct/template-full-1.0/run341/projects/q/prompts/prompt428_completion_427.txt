  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because if "object" is replaced with "promise", then the function will check if "promise" is a promise instead of "object".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because if "object" is replaced with "rejection", then the function will check if "rejection" is a rejected promise instead of "object".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected
```
This would result in different behavior because if "object" is replaced with "inspected", then the function will check if "inspected" is a fulfilled or rejected promise instead of "object".

DONE.
