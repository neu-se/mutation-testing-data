  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a ternary operator to check if `options` is defined, and if not, returns `null`. In contrast, using `undefined` as the default value would result in a different return value when `options` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a ternary operator to check if `options` is not defined, and if so, returns `null`. In contrast, using `!options` as the condition would result in a different return value when `options` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? null : options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a ternary operator to check if `options` is defined, and if so, returns `null`.
