  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n' + newline
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an extra newline character at the end of the line, even if it already ends with a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`\n` + newline
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an extra newline character at the beginning of the line, even if it already starts with a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' <hr> ' + newline
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an extra horizontal rule at the beginning and end of the line, even if it already contains a horizontal rule.

DONE.
