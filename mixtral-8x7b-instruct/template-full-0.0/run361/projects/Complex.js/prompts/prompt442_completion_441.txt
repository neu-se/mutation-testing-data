 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10 ** places
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) instead of the `Math.pow` function. The exponentiation operator has a higher precedence than the multiplication operator, which could lead to different results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(10) * places)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.exp` and `Math.log` functions to calculate the power, instead of using the `Math.pow` function. While the result should be the same in most cases, there might be differences due to floating-point precision issues or edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places * Math.LN10
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the natural logarithm of 10 (`Math.LN10`) instead of calculating
