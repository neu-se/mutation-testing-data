  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the iterator, which may be different from the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` would return the next operation in the iterator, which may be different from the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.slice(1)` would return a new iterator that skips the first operation in the original iterator, which may be different from the current operation.

DONE.
