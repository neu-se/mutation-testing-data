  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would not be called with the `data` argument, even though `end` is false, because `op && op(data)` is a short-circuit evaluation that will evaluate to `false` if `op` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would be called with `null` instead of `end` as the argument, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the `onEnd` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to represent the `undefined` value, and will evaluate to `undefined` when used as an argument to `onEnd`. This could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the `onEnd` function if it expects a specific value to be passed to it.

DONE.
