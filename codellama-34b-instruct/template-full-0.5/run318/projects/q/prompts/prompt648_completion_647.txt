  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `post` method, which would cause an error if the method is not designed to handle it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `post` method, which would cause an error if the method is not designed to handle it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `post` method, which would cause an error if the method is not designed to handle it.

DONE.
