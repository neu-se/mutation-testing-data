  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++this._inFlightWrites;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `_inFlightWrites` property after the `write` method is called, while the replacement code increments it before the `write` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--this._inFlightWrites;
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code decrements the `_inFlightWrites` property instead of incrementing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites -= 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code decrements the `_inFlightWrites` property by 2 instead of incrementing it by 1.

DONE.
