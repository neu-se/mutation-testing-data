  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` is a function that would resolve the promise with the given value, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that would reject the promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(new Error('rejected'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that would resolve the promise with the given value, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that would reject the promise with the given reason. In this option, we are calling `deferred.resolve` with an Error object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.throw` is a function that would throw an error and reject the promise, whereas `deferred.reject` is a
