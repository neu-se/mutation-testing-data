  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the code to only execute if both `window` and `self` are defined, whereas the original code would execute if either `window` or `self` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" || typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the code to execute if either `window` or `self` is not defined, whereas the original code would execute if either `window` or `self` is defined.
