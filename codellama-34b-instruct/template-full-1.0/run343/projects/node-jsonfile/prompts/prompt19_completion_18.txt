  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`file` + '🐶'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new character to the file name, which could cause the file to be named differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`file`.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the first character of the file name and returns a new string, which could cause errors if the file name is not a string or if the first character is not what the code expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
()` => `file`.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new arrow function that takes no arguments and returns the first character of the file name. This could cause errors if the function is not called or if the first character is not what the code expects.

DONE.
