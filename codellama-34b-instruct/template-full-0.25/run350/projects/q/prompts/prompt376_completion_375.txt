  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(newValue)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `newValue`, whereas `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify(newValue)` would cause the promise to be notified with the value `newValue`, whereas `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified with the value `value`.

DONE.
