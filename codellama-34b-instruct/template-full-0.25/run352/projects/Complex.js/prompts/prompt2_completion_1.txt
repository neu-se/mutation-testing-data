  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple number, while `x + 1` is a more complex expression. The `cosh` function is sensitive to small changes in its input, so a small change in the input can result in a large change in the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple number, while `x * 2` is a more complex expression. The `cosh` function is sensitive to small changes in its input, so a small change in the input can result in a large change in the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple number, while `x / 2` is a more complex expression. The `cosh` function is sensitive to small
