  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of the exception, rather than the exception itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(exception.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the exception, rather than the exception itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.throw(exception.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of the exception, rather than the exception itself.

DONE.
