  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use the latitude of the starting point instead of the ending point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use a latitude that is one degree higher than the actual ending point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would use a latitude that is twice the actual ending point.

DONE.
