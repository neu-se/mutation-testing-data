  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has the property `latitude`, while this modified code fragment checks if `object` is an object and does not have the property `latitude`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has the property `latitude`, while this modified code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has the property `longitude`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has the property `latitude`, while this modified code fragment checks
