  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the modified code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the modified code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the modified code fragment throws an error.

DONE.
