  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this._inFlightWrites` is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly less than 0. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this._inFlightWrites` is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly less than 0. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.
