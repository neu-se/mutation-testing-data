  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move one step further than intended, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move one step backward than intended, potentially missing important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move twice as far as intended, potentially skipping over important operations or repeating operations that should only be performed once.

DONE.
