Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it causes the code to skip the current operation from the `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations as it ignores the intended operation from the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation from `otherIter` without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times, leading to unexpected results in the transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: true };
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the operation with a delete operation, which would change the semantics of the transformation by indicating that the operation should delete content rather than retain it, potentially resulting in data loss.

DONE.
