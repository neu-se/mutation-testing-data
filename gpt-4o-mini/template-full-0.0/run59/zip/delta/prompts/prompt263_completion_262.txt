Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of `thisOp` instead of `otherOp`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute comparisons when determining the differences between the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the second argument to `AttributeMap.diff`, which would ignore the attributes of `otherOp` entirely, likely resulting in incorrect diff calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` instead of the expected attributes object, which could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the `AttributeMap.diff` function, as it may not handle `undefined` correctly.

DONE.
