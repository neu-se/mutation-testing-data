  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would be returning a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise, which would cause the `tap` method to call its callback with the rejected value instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would be returning a fulfilled promise with a different value than the original promise, which would cause the `tap` method to call its callback with a different value.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
const newValue = value * 2;
return newValue;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would be returning a fulfilled promise with a different value than the original promise, which would cause the `tap` method to call its callback with a different value.

DONE.
