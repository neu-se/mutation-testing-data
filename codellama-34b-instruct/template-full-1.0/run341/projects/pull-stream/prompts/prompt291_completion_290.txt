  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now always return `false`, regardless of the value of the `field` parameter. In the original code, the function returns `true` if the item has been seen before, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now return `true` if the `field` parameter is not `null`, instead of returning `true` if the item has been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now return `true` if the `field` parameter is not `undefined`, instead of returning `true` if the item has been seen before.

DONE.
