Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the `retain` properties of `thisOp` and `otherOp` instead of their `insert` properties, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that should be based on the inserted content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, causing the code to execute the `else` block when the `insert` properties are equal, which could lead to unintended operations being performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.insert` is `null`, which would bypass the equality check entirely and could lead to incorrect logic being applied when `thisOp.insert` is not `null`.

DONE.
