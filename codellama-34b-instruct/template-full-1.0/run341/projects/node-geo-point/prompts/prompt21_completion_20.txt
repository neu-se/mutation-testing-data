  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the 'latitude' and 'longitude' properties are present, while this new code checks if they are both missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if any of the properties are present, while this new code checks if both are missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value is null, while this new code checks if the value is a certain string.

DONE.
