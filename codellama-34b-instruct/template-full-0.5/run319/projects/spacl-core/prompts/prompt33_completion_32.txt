  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `part` to be a string, but this replacement would make it a number. This could cause errors when the code tries to use `part` as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `part` to be a non-empty string, but this replacement would make it null. This could cause errors when the code tries to use `part` as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `part` to be a non-empty string, but this replacement would make it undefined. This could cause errors when the code tries to use `part` as a string.

DONE.
