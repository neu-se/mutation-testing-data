  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `isArray` checks if a value is an array, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isArray` checks if a value is not an array, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray(object) && object.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is an array and has the property 'type', while `isObject` only checks if the value is an object.

DONE.
