  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
