  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression has been removed, which would cause the regular expression to be case-sensitive. As a result, words that contain lowercase letters would no longer match the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:\t|,|;|\.|:)\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer be able to match the words that were
