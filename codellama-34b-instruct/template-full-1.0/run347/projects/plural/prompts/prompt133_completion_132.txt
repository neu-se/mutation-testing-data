  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the first rule unconditionally, ignoring the condition `rule[0].test(word)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the rule to be applied only when the condition is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always apply the first rule, regardless of the condition, as the `length` property is always truthy.

DONE.
