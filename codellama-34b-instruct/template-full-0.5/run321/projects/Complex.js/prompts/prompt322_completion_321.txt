  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the cosine of the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the cosine of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the cosine of the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of the real part.

DONE.
