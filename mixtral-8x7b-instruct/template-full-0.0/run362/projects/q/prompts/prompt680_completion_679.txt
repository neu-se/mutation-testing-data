 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `apply` method is now `null` instead of `undefined`. This could cause issues if the function being applied expects the `this` value to be set to a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[this, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
