  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call the `reject` function with the exception as an argument, while the modified code would throw an error directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call the `reject` function with the exception as an argument, while the modified code would return a rejected promise with the exception as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op), true);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call the `reject` function with the exception as an argument, while the modified code would return a rejected promise
