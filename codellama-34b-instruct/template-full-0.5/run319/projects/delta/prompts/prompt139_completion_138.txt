  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to check the type of the next operation in the other delta, rather than the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to check the length of the next operation in the current delta, rather than the type of the next operation in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to check the length of the next operation in the other delta, rather than the type of the next operation in the other delta.

DONE.
