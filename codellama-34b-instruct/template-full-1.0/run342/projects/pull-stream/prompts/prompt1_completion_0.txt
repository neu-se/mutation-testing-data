  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(k in sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `sources` array instead of the `sinks` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(k in sinks)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `sinks` array instead of the `throughs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(k in throughs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `throughs` array instead of the `sinks` array.

DONE.
