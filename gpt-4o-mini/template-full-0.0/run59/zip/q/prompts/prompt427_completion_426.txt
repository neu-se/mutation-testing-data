Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly classify any object as a rejected promise, regardless of its actual state, leading to false positives in rejection checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true for arrays, meaning that non-array promise objects would be incorrectly identified as not being rejected, thus failing to recognize actual rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify fulfilled promises as rejected, leading to incorrect handling of promise states and potentially causing logical errors in promise chains.

DONE.
