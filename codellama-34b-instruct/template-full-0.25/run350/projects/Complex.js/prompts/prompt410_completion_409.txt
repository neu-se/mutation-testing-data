  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to determine whether the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and setting it to `false` would cause the code to execute the `else` branch, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = !noIM
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is negated, which would cause the code to execute the `else` branch when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = Math.random() > 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is set to a random value, which would cause the code to execute the `else` branch with a probability of 0.5, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
