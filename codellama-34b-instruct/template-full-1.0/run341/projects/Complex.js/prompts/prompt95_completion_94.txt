  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the variable `a` instead of the original value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the variable `b` instead of the original value `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hard-code the value `3` instead of using the original value `1`.

DONE.
