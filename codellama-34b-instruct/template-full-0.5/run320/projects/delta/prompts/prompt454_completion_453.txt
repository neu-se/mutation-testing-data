  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to always return a non-empty array, even if the iterator has reached the end of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to always return a non-empty array, even if the iterator has reached the end of the operations, and would also cause the `peekLength()` method to return a value that is always greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to always return a non-empty array, even if the iterator has reached the end of the operations, and would also cause the `peekLength()` method to return a value that is always less than 0.

DONE.
