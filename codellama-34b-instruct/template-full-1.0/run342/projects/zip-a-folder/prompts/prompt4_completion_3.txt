  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression == COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the highest compression level, even if the user had specified a different level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression != COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never use the uncompressed compression level, even if the user had specified it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the medium compression level, even if the user had specified a different level.

DONE.
