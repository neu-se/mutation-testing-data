Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getInvalidHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent or incorrect handler, which would likely lead to runtime errors or unexpected results when trying to compose operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandlerWithError
```
This would result in different behavior because it could invoke a handler that intentionally introduces errors or incorrect logic, leading to faulty compositions of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.bind(null, 'invalidType')
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the handler to an invalid type, which may cause the composition logic to fail or produce incorrect results when handling operations of different types.

DONE.
