  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'Hello, world!';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `newOp`, which would retain the original value of `newOp`, while this code fragment would replace it with the string `'Hello, world!'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `newOp`, which would retain the original value of `newOp`, while this code fragment would replace it with the number `42`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `newOp`, which would retain the original value of `newOp`, while this code fragment would replace it with `null`.

DONE.
