 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"spy", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `"spy"` is not a recognized method, and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is being passed as the `this` value instead of `undefined`, which could cause issues in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [args, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments passed to the `apply` method has been changed, which would cause the function to receive incorrect arguments.

DONE.
