  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` is always truthy, even if the promise is already resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages[0]` is always truthy, even if the promise is already resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!resolvedPromise` checks if the promise is already resolved, and if it is, it will not execute the code inside the `if` statement.

DONE.
