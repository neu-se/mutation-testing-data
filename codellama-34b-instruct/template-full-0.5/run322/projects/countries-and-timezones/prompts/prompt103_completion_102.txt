  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev` would always be an empty object, causing the `deliverTimezones` function to always return an empty object, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev` would always be null, causing the `deliverTimezones` function to always return null, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev = !prev
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev` would be inverted, causing the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result when the input is an object.

DONE.
