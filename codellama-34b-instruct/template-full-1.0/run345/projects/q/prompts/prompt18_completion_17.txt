  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: ```!0```
This would result in different behavior because !0 is the boolean negation of the placeholder, essentially negating the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: ```+Infinity```
This would result in different behavior because +Infinity is a numeric value that represents infinity and the code would now expect a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: ```function() { throw new Error(); }```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would enter into an infinite loop where the error is constantly thrown and not handled.

DONE.
