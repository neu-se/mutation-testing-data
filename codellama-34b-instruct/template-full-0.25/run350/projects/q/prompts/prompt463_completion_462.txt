  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track unhandled rejections differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would not be affected by the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty array, regardless of the state of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
