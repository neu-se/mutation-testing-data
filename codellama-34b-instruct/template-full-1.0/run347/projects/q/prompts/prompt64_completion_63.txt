  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(process.nextTick);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` would be called immediately, rather than in the next tick of the Node.js event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(function () {
    throw new Error("sync");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown synchronously, rather than asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush.bind(null, false));
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` would be called with the second argument set to `false`, rather than the default of `true`.

DONE.
