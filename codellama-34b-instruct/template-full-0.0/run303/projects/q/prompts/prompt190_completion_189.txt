  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first capture group instead of the second, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the third capture group instead of the second, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the fourth capture group instead of the second, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the stack trace.

DONE.
