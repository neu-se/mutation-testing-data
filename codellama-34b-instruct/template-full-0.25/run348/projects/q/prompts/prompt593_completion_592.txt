  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and an argument list, whereas `apply` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments, whereas `apply` and `call` call the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments, whereas `callback.apply(null)` would call the function with a `this` value of `null` and an empty array of arguments.

DONE.
