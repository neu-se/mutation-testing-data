Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the parser to exit when there are no plus or minus signs, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to exit only when there are no plus or minus signs, potentially missing valid cases where there are plus or minus signs but still leading to an exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the parser to exit even when there are valid plus or minus signs, leading to incorrect parsing of valid input.

DONE.
