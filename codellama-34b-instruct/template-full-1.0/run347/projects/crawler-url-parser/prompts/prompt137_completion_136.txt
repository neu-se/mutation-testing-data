  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because " " is a different string literal than '/', and would break the logic of the `replace` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a string, and would break the logic of the `replace` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a string, and would break the logic of the `replace` method.

DONE.
