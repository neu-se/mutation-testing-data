 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*/.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the `spec` starts with a valid character, but not if it contains invalid characters in other positions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!!spec.match(/^\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the `spec` starts with a slash, but doesn't throw an error if it doesn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) || spec.match(/\/$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `spec` ends with a slash or contains malformed captures, but doesn't throw an error in either case.

DONE.
