  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the promise is in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the promise is in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is not in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if it is in the array.

DONE.
