  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    if(true) 
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `if` statement always evaluate to true, causing the code within the block to be executed regardless of the value of `isInternalFrame`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    if(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `if` statement always evaluate to false, causing the code within the block to never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    if(error.message === 'Bad things happened') 
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true only if the error message is exactly `'Bad things happened'`, otherwise it would evaluate to false.
