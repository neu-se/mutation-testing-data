  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called twice, whereas in the original code it is only called once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function(){return deferred.reject;});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be wrapped in an anonymous function, which would cause it to be called with a different `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of the `deferred.reject` function, causing the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
