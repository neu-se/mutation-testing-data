  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Object.keys()` method to get the key of the first property of the `embedType` object, which returns a string. The new code fragment uses the `toLowerCase()` method to convert the string to lowercase, which would result in a different key being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Object.keys()` method to get the key of the first property of the `embedType` object, which returns a string. The new code fragment uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the string to uppercase, which would result in a different key being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Object.keys()` method to get the key of the first property
