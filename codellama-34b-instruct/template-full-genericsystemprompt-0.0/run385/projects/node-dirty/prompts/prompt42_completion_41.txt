  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of the expected value, which could cause unexpected errors or behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of the expected value, which could cause unexpected errors or behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `key` property of the `this._data` object, which could be different from the expected value if the `key` property is not defined or has a different value.

DONE.
