  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would always be "fulfilled", even if the promise was rejected, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would always be "rejected", even if the promise was fulfilled, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would always be "pending", even if the promise was fulfilled or rejected, which would cause the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
