  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the current operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` returns the type of the current operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the current operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` advances the iterator to the next operation and returns the current operation, while `iter.peek()` returns the current operation without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
