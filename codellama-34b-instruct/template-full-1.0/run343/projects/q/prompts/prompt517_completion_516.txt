  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a rejected promise to be returned, whereas the original code fragment would cause a resolved promise to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a rejected promise to be returned, whereas the original code fragment would cause a resolved promise to be returned.

DONE.
