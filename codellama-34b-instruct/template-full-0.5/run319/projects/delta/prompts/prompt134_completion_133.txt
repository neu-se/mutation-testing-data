  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would skip over the next operation, potentially causing the algorithm to miss important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would go back to the previous operation, potentially causing the algorithm to repeat operations or go into an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would return a null operation, potentially causing the algorithm to crash or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
