  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being sliced, which would cause the first argument to be removed from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being wrapped in a new array, which would cause the method to receive a nested array instead of a flat array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being concatenated with itself, which would cause the method to receive a duplicate of the original array.

DONE.
