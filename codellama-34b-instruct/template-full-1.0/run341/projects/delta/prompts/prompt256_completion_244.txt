  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
var foo = function (bar) {
  // Do something with bar
  return bar * 2;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function definition `foo` would be hoisted to the top of the code block, potentially causing issues with the rest of the code that relies on the previous definition of `foo`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
console.log("This is a fake log statement");
```
This would result in different behavior because the new `console.log` statement would be executed, potentially printing unexpected output to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
throw new Error("This is a fake error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the new `throw` statement would cause the code to throw an error, potentially crashing the application or causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
