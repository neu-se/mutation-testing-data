  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return x
```
This would result in different behavior because `return x` would return the value of `x` immediately, whereas `reject` would return a rejected promise.

DONE.
