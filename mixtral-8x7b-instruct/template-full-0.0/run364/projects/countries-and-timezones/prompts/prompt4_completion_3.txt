 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function now checks for the exact value of `timezonesMap` being `undefined`, instead of checking if it's falsy. This change might cause the function to return an incorrect or unexpected value if `timezonesMap` is initialized to `null` or `0`, for example.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap?.buildTimezonesMap
