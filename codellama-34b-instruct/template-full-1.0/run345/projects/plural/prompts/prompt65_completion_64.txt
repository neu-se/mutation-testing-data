  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second value in the tuple is now different, so the test would fail to detect the bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'virus'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second value in the tuple has changed, so the test would fail to detect the bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'virus', 'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the values in the tuple has changed, so the test would fail to detect the bug.

DONE.
