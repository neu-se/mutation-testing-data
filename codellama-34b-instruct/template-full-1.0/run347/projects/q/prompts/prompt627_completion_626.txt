  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code sample with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set!"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set!" is not a valid method for a Q promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because "foo" is not a valid method for a Q promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set" + "!"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" and "!" are concatenated to form a new string, which is not a valid method for a Q promise.

DONE.
