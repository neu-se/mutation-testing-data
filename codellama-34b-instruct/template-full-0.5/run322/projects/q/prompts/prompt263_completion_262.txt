  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which would trigger the rejection handlers instead of the fulfillment handlers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with no value instead of the original value, which could cause differences in the behavior of the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value (undefined instead of the original value), which could cause differences in the behavior of the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
