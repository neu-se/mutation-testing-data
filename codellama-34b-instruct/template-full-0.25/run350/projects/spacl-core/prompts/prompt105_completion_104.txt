  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was referring to the `name` property of the `policy` object, while the new code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was referring to the `name` property of the `policy` object, while the new code fragment is calling the `toUpperCase()` method on the `name` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was referring to the `name` property of the `policy` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the `length` property of the `name` property.

DONE.
