Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `arg` would cause the generator to yield `null`, which may lead to unexpected results or errors in the subsequent promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `arg` would mean that the generator does not receive the intended value, potentially causing logic errors or unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unexpected value"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `"unexpected value"` instead of the `arg` would disrupt the expected flow of the generator, leading to incorrect processing of the yielded value and possibly causing runtime errors.

DONE.
