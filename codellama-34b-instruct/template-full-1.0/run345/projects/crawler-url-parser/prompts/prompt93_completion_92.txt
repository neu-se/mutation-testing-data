  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsing = _has_illegal_chars(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `parse` function to normalize the URL, while this code uses the `_has_illegal_chars` function to check if the URL contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr).url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `parse` function to normalize the URL and return the modified URL, while this code uses the `parse` function to normalize the URL and then extracts the URL from the resulting object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr).protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `parse` function to normalize the URL and return the modified URL, while this code uses the `parse` function to normalize the URL and then extracts the protocol from the resulting object
