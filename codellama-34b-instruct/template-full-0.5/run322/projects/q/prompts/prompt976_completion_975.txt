  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass an empty array if `args` is `undefined`, whereas this code would pass an array with a single element (1) if `args` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || [null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass an empty array if `args` is `undefined`, whereas this code would pass an array with a single element (`null`) if `args` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || ["hello"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass an empty array if `args` is `undefined`, whereas this code would pass an array with a single element ("hello") if `args` is `undefined`.

DONE.
