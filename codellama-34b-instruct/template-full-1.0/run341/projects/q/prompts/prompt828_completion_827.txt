  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the Q.onerror variable, which is used as a flag to determine whether an error should be thrown or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object and assign it to the Q.onerror variable, which would trigger the error-handling code path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = () => void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a no-op function to the Q.onerror variable, which would effectively disable the error-handling code path.

DONE.
