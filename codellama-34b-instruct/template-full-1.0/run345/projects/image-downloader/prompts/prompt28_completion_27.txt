  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes characters from the end of the string, not the beginning, which could cause the request to fail or return incorrect data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given string, whereas `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given string. This could cause the request to be sent to the wrong URL or return incorrect data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the string contains the given string, whereas `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given string. This could cause the request to be sent to the wrong URL or return incorrect data.

DONE.
