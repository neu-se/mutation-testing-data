  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator is used to remove a property from an object, while the `set` operator is used to set a property on an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator is used to remove a property from an object, while the `post` method is used to send a message to a value in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator is used to remove a property from an object, while the `apply` method is used to apply a function to an array of arguments.

DONE.
