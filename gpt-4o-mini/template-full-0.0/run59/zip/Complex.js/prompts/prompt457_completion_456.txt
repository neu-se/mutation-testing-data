Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if the complex number is both finite and NaN, which is logically impossible, leading to a false positive for infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() || this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if either the complex number is finite or NaN, which contradicts the intended check for infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity || this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if either the real or imaginary part is exactly Infinity, ignoring cases where the complex number is not NaN or finite but still represents an infinite value in a broader sense.

DONE.
