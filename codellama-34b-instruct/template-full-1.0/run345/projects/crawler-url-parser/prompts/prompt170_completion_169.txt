  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.includes(pageurl_parts)
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl_parts` and `pageurl_parts` are arrays, and `includes()` checks if one array is a subset of the other, whereas `linkurl.domain == pageurl.domain` checks if the two domains are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain != pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the two subdomains are not the same, whereas `linkurl.domain == pageurl.domain` checks if the two domains are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the two hosts are not the same, whereas `linkurl.domain == pageurl.domain` checks if the two domains are the same.

DONE.
