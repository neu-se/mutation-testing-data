  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the entire URL path, including the file extension, and replace it with a space. This would cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "."
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the entire URL path, including the file extension, and replace it with a period. This would cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, ".."
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the entire URL path, including the file extension, and replace it with two periods. This would cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly, resulting in different behavior.
