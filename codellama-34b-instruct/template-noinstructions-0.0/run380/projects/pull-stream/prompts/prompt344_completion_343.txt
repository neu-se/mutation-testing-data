  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy, while this replacement always calls the `onAbort` function, regardless of its truthiness.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy and calls it if it is, while this replacement always calls `onAbort` if it is truthy, but does not check if it is truthy first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort || onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy and calls it if it is, while this replacement always calls `onAbort` if it is falsy, but does not check if it is truthy first.

DONE.
