  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, meaning that the code would behave as if `ended` was `false`, even if it was `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `false` if `ended` is `true`, meaning that the code would behave as if `ended` was `false`, even if it was `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if `ended` is `true`, meaning that the code would behave as if `ended` was `true`, even if it was `false`.

DONE.
