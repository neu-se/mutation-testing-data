 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.current().attributes.start
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `start` property of the `attributes` object of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator, which may not exist or have the same value as `baseIndex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the initial index to 0, ignoring the previous index in the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(baseIndex - length, 0)
