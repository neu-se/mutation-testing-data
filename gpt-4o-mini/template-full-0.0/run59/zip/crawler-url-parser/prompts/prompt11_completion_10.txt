Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^http:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace URLs that start with "http://" instead of any protocol-relative URLs (i.e., those starting with "//"), potentially leading to incorrect parsing of URLs that should be treated as relative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!.*:\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that does not contain "://", which would prevent the addition of "http://" to valid URLs that already have a protocol, leading to malformed URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the regex case-insensitive, which is unnecessary for URL protocols and could lead to unexpected matches, although it would still match the same strings as the original regex.

DONE.
