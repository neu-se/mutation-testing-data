  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(null, decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join()` method to return `null`, which is not a valid path and would likely cause the `request()` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join()` method to return a path that is not the same as the original path, which could potentially cause the `request()` function to fail or behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join()` method to return a path that is not the same as the original path, which could potentially cause the `request()` function to fail or behave differently.

DONE
