  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `stack` property of the `p` object is being accessed instead of the `stack` property itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `stack` property of the `p` object is being called instead of the `stack` property itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because a slice of the `stack` property of the `p` object is being accessed instead of the `stack` property itself.

DONE.
