  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').reverse().slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now reversing the array before slicing it, which could cause the resulting regex to match different paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now joining the array elements with an empty string before slicing it, which could cause the resulting regex to match different paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).map(x => x.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now mapping each array element to its reverse before slicing it, which could cause the resulting regex to match different paths.

DONE.
