 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` expects an object with `index` and `value` properties, and passing `null` would not provide the necessary information for progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
