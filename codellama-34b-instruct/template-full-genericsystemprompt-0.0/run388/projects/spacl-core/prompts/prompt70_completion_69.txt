  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `path` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the `path` string is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `path` string starting from the second character, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the `path` string is not properly formatted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `path` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as a delimiter, and then return the first element of the array. This could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the `path
