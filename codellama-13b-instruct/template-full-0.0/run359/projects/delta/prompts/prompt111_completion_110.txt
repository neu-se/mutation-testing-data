  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of an array, while the `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes and/or adds elements to an array at a specific index, while the `push` method only adds elements to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element of an array, while the `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
