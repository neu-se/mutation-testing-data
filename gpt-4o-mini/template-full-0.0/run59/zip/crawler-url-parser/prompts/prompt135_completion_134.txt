Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from replacing specific patterns in the path to simply retrieving the last segment of the path, which may not accurately reflect the intended normalization of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').toUpperCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the entire path to uppercase after performing the replacements, which could lead to incorrect comparisons since URLs are case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').concat('/extra');
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an additional segment (`/extra`) to the path, which alters the structure of the URL and could lead to incorrect URL resolution or comparison.

DONE.
