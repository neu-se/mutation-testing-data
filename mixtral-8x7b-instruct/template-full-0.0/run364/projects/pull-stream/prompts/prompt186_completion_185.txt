 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not being invoked, and the error handling behavior of the original code would not be present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `cb` is now `undefined`, whereas in the original code, the second argument is the current element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `cb` is now `false`, whereas in the original code, the first argument is `true` when all elements in the array have been processed.

DONE.
