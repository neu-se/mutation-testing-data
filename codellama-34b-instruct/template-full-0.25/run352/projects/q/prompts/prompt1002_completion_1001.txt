  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a request to a server, while the `get` method is used to retrieve a resource from a server.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a request to a server, while the `put` method is used to update a resource on a server.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a request to a server, while the `delete` method is used to delete a resource from a server.

DONE.
