  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would not have access to the `baseOp` variable, resulting in a `ReferenceError` when attempting to access the `attributes` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would not have access to the `baseOp` variable, resulting in an `UnexpectedTokenException` when attempting to access the `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would not have access to the `baseOp` variable, resulting in an `UnexpectedTokenException` when attempting to access the `attributes` property.

DONE.
