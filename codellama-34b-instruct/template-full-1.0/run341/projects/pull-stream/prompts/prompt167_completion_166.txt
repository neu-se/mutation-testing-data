  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the `if` statement would always be evaluated to `true` if `abort` is not `null` or `undefined`. This would cause the function to return the result of `abortCb` unconditionally, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only be evaluated to `true` if `abort` is `false`. This would cause the function to return the result of `abortCb` only if `abort` is `false`, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`,
