 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with `undefined` instead of checking if `args` is nullish (`null` or `undefined`). This change may cause the code to skip the type error check if `arguments.length` is 0 or if `a` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, which would bypass the type error check even if `arguments.length` is greater than 0 and `a` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof args !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `args` is not an object, which would bypass the type error check even if `arguments.length` is greater than 0 and `a` is a function.
