  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` argument is replaced with `unhandledRejections[at]`, which is a different object than the original `promise` argument. This could cause the `process.emit()` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
