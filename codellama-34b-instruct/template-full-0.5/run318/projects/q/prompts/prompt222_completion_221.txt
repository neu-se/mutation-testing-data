  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new instance of the `defer` constructor, rather than using the existing instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.constructor.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new instance of the `defer` constructor's prototype, rather than using the existing instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.constructor.prototype.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new instance of the `defer` constructor's prototype's prototype, rather than using the existing instance.

DONE.
