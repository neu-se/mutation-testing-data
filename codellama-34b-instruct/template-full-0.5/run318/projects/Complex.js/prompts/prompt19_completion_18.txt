  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with `x` instead of `y`, which could lead to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with `x+y` instead of `y`, which could lead to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with `x*y` instead of `y`, which could lead to a different output.

DONE.
