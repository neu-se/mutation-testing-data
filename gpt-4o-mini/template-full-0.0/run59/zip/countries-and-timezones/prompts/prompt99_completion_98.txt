Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's values instead of its keys, which would change the structure of the output and potentially lead to incorrect results when filtering for non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).filter(key => tzs[key].active)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the keys based on whether the timezone is marked as active instead of checking for the deprecated property, which would lead to a different set of timezones being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would skip the first key in the list of timezones, potentially omitting a timezone that should be included in the final output.

DONE.
