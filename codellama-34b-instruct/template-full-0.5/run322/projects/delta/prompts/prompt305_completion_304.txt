  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the line is not empty, while this new code checks if the line has more than one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the line is not empty, while this new code checks if the line has less than zero characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the line is not empty, while this new code checks if the line is empty.

DONE.
