  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, while the modified code would push `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, while the modified code would push `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, while the modified code would push the number `0` instead.

DONE.
