  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the peeked type is not 'insert', while this replacement code is checking if it is 'insert'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the peeked type is not 'insert', while this replacement code is checking if the peeked length is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the peeked type is not 'insert', while this replacement code is checking if the other iterator has a next value.

DONE.
