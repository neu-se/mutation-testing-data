  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of a value, while the replaced code fragment checks for the presence of a value and its type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of a value, while the replaced code fragment checks for the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of a value, while the replaced code fragment checks for the presence of a specific value (zero).

DONE.
