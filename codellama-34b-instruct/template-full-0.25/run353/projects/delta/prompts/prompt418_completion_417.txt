  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the iterator to skip over the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the iterator to skip over the previous operation in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the iterator to skip over two operations in the delta.

DONE.
