Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\?.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the query string (everything after the `?`) from the URL instead of removing the fragment (everything after the `#`), potentially altering the URL's parameters instead of its fragment identifier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the fragment with a fixed URL (`http://example.com`), which changes the URL structure entirely rather than simply removing the fragment, leading to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the fragment with the string `'undefined'`, which could lead to unexpected results in URL parsing and potentially create invalid URLs, rather than just removing the fragment.

DONE.
