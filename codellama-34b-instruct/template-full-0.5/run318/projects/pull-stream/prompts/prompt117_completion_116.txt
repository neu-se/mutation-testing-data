  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of exactly 2, while this new fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length less than 2. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `arguments` object has a length of 1 or 0, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of exactly 2, while this new fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length greater than 2. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `arguments` object has a length of 3 or more, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
