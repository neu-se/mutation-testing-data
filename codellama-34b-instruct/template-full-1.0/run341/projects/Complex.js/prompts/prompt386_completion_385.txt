  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the sign of the argument `b`, which would change the result of the `cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (b / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the argument `b` by `a`, which would change the ratio of the arguments and affect the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (b / Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `2 * b` argument with a different constant, which would change the final result.

DONE.
