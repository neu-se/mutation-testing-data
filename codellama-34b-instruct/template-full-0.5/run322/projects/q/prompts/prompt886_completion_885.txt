  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to extract the first argument, but this replacement code fragment would extract the first two arguments instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to extract all arguments except the first, but this replacement code fragment would extract only the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to extract all arguments except the first, but this replacement code fragment would extract only the last argument.

DONE.
