  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be incremented by 1, potentially causing the code to skip over a character or operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be decremented by 1, potentially causing the code to go back to a previous character or operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be multiplied by 2, potentially causing the code to skip over multiple characters or operations.

DONE.
