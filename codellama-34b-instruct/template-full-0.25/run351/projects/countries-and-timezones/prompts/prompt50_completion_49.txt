  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `timezones` object as an argument, rather than the `id` variable. This would likely cause the function to return a different value, or possibly throw an error if the `timezones` object does not have a property with the same name as the `id` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id].name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` property of the `timezones[id]` object as an argument, rather than the `id` variable. This would likely cause the function to return a different value, or possibly throw an error if the `timezones[id]` object does not have a `name` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
