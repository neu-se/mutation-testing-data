  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that calls a function with the given arguments, whereas `Q` is a promise library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, whereas `Q` is a promise library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q` is a promise library.

DONE.
