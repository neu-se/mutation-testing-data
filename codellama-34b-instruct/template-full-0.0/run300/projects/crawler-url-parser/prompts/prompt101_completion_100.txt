  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set` would add a new entry to the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would retrieve an existing entry.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.delete` would remove an entry from the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would retrieve an existing entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.clear` would remove all entries from the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would retrieve an existing entry.

DONE.
