 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would not be checked for existence, and `true` would always be passed to the conditional expression, changing the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would not be checked for existence, and the number `1` would always be passed to the conditional expression, changing the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would not be checked for existence, and `null` would always be passed to the conditional expression, changing the behavior of the code.

DONE.
