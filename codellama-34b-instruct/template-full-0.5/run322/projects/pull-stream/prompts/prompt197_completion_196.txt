  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is always true inside the `map` function, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if the `read` function has already ended normally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy && !aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!busy` check is now only executed if the `aborted` flag is not set, which would prevent the `map` function from being called unnecessarily.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy || aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!busy` check is now only executed if the `aborted` flag is set, which would allow the `map` function to be called even if the `read` function has already ended normally.

DONE.
