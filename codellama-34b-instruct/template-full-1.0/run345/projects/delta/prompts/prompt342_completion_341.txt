  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Op.length(op) - iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return -1 instead of 0 when `indexOf` returns -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Op.length(op) + iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a larger negative number instead of 0 when `indexOf` returns -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return ~Op.length(op) + iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a value that is similar to the original value but not exactly the same.

DONE.
