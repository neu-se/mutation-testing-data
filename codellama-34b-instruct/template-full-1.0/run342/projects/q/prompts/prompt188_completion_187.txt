  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isNodeFrame = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is part of a node frame, and if it is, it returns `true`. By replacing it with `false`, the function `filterStackString` will always return the entire stack, without filtering anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isInternalFrame = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `isInternalFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is part of an internal frame, and if it is, it returns `true`. By replacing it with `true`, the function `filterStackString` will always filter the stack, regardless of whether the frame is internal or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var stack = ["dummyStack"];
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `stack` is a local variable
