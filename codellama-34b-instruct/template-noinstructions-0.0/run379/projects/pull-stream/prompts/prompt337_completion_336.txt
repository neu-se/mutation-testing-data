  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (e) { return e + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of an object, while the new code fragment `function (e) { return e + 1 }` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of an object plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (e) { return e - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of an object, while the new code fragment `function (e) { return e - 1 }` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of an object minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (e) { return e * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop
