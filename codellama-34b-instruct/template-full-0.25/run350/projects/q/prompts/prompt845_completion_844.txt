  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `error` argument to the `setTimeout` function, which is used to set the timeout for the promise rejection. Replacing `error` with `null` would cause the `setTimeout` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which would result in the promise being rejected after `ms` milliseconds with a value of `null`, rather than the original `error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `error` argument to the `setTimeout` function, which is used to set the timeout for the promise rejection. Replacing `error` with `new Error()` would cause the `setTimeout` function to be called with a new `Error` object as the second argument, which would result in the promise being rejected after `ms` milliseconds with a different error object than the original `error` object.
