  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes == newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while this code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type. This could cause the code to produce different results if the attributes are not of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes !== newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality, while this code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type. This could cause the code to produce different results if the attributes are not of the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.is(lastOp.attributes, newOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `===` operator, which
