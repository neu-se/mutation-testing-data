  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the function's `this` context in the array of arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide an empty array of arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments and pass only the remaining arguments to the function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
