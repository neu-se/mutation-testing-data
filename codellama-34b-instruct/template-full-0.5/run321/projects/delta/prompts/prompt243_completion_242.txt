  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `otherIter.next(opLength)` and passes the result to `retDelta.push()`, while this option calls `otherIter.next(opLength)` and passes the result to `delta.push()`, which is a different variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength - 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `otherIter.next(opLength)` and passes the result to `retDelta.push()`, while this option calls `otherIter.next(opLength - 1)` and passes the result to `delta.push()`, which is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(opLength + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `otherIter
