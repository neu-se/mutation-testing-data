  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a non-200 status code, while this new code fragment checks for a 404 status code specifically. If the server returns a 404 status code, the original code would still consider the request to be successful, while the new code would consider it to be a failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 201
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a non-200 status code, while this new code fragment checks for a status code that is neither 200 nor 201. If the server returns a status code that is not 200 or 201, the original code would still consider the request to be successful, while the new code would consider it to be a failure.
