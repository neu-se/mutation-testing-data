  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected an object, whereas the new code would pass a number, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected an object, whereas the new code would pass a null value, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected an object with specific properties, whereas the new code would pass an empty object, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
