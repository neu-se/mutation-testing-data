  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, potentially causing the `next()` method to be called with a negative index, which could result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the `next()` method to be called with an index that is out of bounds, which could result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, potentially causing the `next()` method to be called with an index that is out of bounds, which could result in an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
