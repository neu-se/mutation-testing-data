  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value passed through args instead of the key as it did in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the name of the property instead of the key as it did in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass both the key and value to dispatch as it did in the original code.

DONE.
