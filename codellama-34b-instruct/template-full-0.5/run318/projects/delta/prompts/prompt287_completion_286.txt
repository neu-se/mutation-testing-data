  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the index was less than 0, which means it was checking if the index was negative, while the new code is checking if the index is greater than 0, which means it is checking if the index is positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the index was less than 0, which means it was checking if the index was negative, while the new code is checking if the variable `i` is less than 0, which is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the index was less than 0, which means it was checking if the index was negative, while the new code is checking if the variable `baseIndex` is less than 0, which is a different
