  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context set to the first argument, which in this case is `this`. This means that the new function will always be called with `this` set to the promise, regardless of how it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with the `this` context set to `null`. This means that the function will be called without any context, which may cause errors if the function relies on `this` being set to a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with the `this` context set to `this` and an empty array of arguments. This means that the function will be called with
