  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peekType()` is a function call that returns the result of the `peekType` function, which is the type of the next operation in the iterator.

DONE.
