  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```realtimeout
500 + Math.random() * 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be randomly generated, making the code more likely to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```othererror
throw new Error("Another Error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw a different error than the original code fragment, which would cause the promise chain to reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```nothen
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not return the expected promise, causing the promise chain to fail.

DONE.
