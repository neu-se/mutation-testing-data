  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the trimmed text of the element, while this replacement returns only the first word of the trimmed text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().slice(0, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the trimmed text of the element, while this replacement returns only the first 5 characters of the trimmed text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the trimmed text of the element, while this replacement returns the trimmed text with all letters removed.

DONE.
