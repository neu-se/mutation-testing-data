  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.toString().trim().includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is added to the text property, which may produce a different string representation of the text that could cause the `includes` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.toLowerCase().includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is added to the text property, which may cause the `includes` method to consider different characters in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method is used instead of the `includes` method, which may produce a different result if the text contains multiple instances of the same character.

DONE.
