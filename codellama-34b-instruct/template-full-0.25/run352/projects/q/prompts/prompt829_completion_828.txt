  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, while this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, while this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of `callback`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, while this replacement would return the `reason` instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
