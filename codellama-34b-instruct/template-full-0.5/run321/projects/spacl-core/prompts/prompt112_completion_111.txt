  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object using the `Object.keys()` method, rather than using the `for...of` loop.

DONE.
