  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, using `unshift` would cause the `messages` array to be processed in reverse order, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.
