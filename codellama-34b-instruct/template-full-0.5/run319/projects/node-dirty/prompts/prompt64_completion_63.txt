  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called immediately after the `write` method, which would cause the write stream to be closed before all data has been written to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called with an error argument, which would cause the write stream to emit an error event before all data has been written to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, () => {
  this._writeStream.end();
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` method is called with a callback function that calls the `end` method after the data has been written to the stream. This would cause the write stream to be closed after all data has been written to it, which is different from the original behavior
