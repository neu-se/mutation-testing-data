  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` will delete the entire delta, whereas `delta.push` will add the operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` will keep the existing delta, whereas `delta.push` will add the operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.concat` will concatenate the current delta with the new operation, whereas `delta.push` will add the operation to the delta.

DONE.
