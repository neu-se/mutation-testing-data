  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true ? null : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `null` if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, but the original code fragment would return `null` if `err` is any falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `err` if it is truthy, but the original code fragment would always return `null`.

DONE.
