  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, which may alter the data being read or written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a portion of a string, starting from the second character. This may cause data to be lost or altered during reading or writing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.repeat(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `repeat()` method duplicates a string, which may cause data to be duplicated or altered during reading or writing.

DONE.
