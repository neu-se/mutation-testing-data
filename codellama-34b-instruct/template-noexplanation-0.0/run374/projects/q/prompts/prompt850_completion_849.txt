  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the `error` variable and the `typeof` operator reversed. This could potentially cause the `error` object to be treated as a string, even if it is not, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" !== typeof error
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the `error` variable and the `typeof` operator reversed. This could potentially cause the `error` object to be treated as a string, even if it is not, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
