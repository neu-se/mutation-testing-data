  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all occurrences of the search string, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\n/g` matches the first newline character in the string, whereas `replace` matches all newline characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\uFEFF/g` matches the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, whereas `replace` does not match the BOM.

DONE.
