  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `exception` and would not propagate the error through every following yield.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `exception` and would not propagate the error through every following yield.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("mutated error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with a different message than the original error, which would be propagated through every following yield.

DONE.
