  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks if the substring is present in the string, and returns the index of the first occurrence. If the substring is not present, it returns -1. In this case, we are checking if the index of the first occurrence is 0, which means the substring is at the beginning of the string.
