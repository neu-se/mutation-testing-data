 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call would reject the promise with `null` instead of an error object, which might cause issues in the code that consumes this rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call would reject the promise with `true` instead of an error object, which might cause issues in the code that consumes this rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call would reject the promise with an empty object instead of an error object, which might cause issues in the code that consumes this rejected promise.

DONE.
