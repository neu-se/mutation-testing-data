  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Function#call()` method would be called on the global object, instead of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Function#call()` method would be called on the `true` primitive, instead of the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Function#call()` method would be called on the `0` primitive, instead of the `callback` function.

DONE.
