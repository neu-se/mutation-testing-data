  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are flipped, causing the database to store the value as the key, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is being doubled before being stored in the database, causing the database to store incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the key is being incremented by 1 before being stored in the database, causing the database to store data at the wrong keys.

DONE.
