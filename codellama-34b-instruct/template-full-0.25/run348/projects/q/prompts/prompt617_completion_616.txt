  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with the `set` method, which would cause the code to set the property instead of getting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with the `delete` method, which would cause the code to delete the property instead of getting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with the `post` method, which would cause the code to post a message to the property instead of getting it.

DONE.
