  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `ended` variable as its first argument, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In the modified code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as its first argument, which is not a boolean value. This change could cause the test suite to fail if it is relying on the specific behavior of the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it has a different behavior. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `ended` variable as its first argument, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In the modified code, the `cb` function is called with the `ended` variable as its second argument, which is not a boolean value. This change could
