  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the second key of the `otherData` object instead of the first key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the first key of the `otherData` object in uppercase instead of the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the first key of the `otherData` object instead of the key itself.

DONE.
