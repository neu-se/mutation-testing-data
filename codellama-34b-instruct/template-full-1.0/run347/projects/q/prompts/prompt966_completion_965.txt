  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `void 0` is a more direct way of writing `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.isPromise(callback) ? this : callback
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `callback` is a promise and returns `this` if it is not, whereas the original code always returns `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would lead to a different execution path in the code.

DONE.
