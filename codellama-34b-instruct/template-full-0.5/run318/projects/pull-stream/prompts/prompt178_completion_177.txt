  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` would call the `abortCb` function with the `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` arguments, while this new code fragment would simply return `cb(false)` without calling any function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` would call the `abortCb` function with the `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` arguments, while this new code fragment would simply return `cb(null, array[i++])` without calling any function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` would call the `abortC
