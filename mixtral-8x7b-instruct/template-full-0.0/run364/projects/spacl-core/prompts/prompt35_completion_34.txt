 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it only gets the last part of the path instead of iterating over all parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const parts = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse();
const part = parts.join('/');
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines all the parts back into a single string, instead of keeping them as an array of parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it only gets the last part of the path, instead of iterating over all parts.

DONE.
