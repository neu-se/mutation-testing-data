  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `null`, rather than the original value `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the value `value`, rather than being resolved with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `value * 2`, which is different from the original value `value`.

DONE.
