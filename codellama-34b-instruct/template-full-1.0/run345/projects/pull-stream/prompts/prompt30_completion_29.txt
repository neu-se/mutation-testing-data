  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth element of the `ref` array is now being passed as an argument to the `pull()` function, instead of the third element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `ref` array is now being passed as an argument to the `pull()` function, instead of the third element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as an argument to the `pull()` function, instead of the third element of the `ref` array.

DONE.
