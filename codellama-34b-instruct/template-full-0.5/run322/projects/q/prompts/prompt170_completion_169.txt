  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable is incremented by 1, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for a different line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable is decremented by 1, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for a different line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable is multiplied by 2, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for a different line number.

DONE.
