  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the imaginary part of the number is infinite, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the real part of the number is infinite, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the imaginary part of the number is infinite, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

DONE.
