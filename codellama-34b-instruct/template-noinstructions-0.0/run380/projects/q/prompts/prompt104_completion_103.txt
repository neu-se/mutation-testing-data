  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `index` is used as an argument to the `array_reduce` function, which expects a value that is not modified during the iteration. By replacing it with `index++`, the value of `index` would be incremented each time it is used as an argument, which could cause the function to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `index` is used as an argument to the `array_reduce` function, which expects a value that is not modified during the iteration. By replacing it with `index--`, the value of `index` would be decremented each time it is used as an argument, which could cause the function to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
