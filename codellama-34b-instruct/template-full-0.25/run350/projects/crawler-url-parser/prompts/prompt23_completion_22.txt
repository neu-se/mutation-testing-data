  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different.

DONE.
