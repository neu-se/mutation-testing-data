  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array with a single element, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns an empty array.

DONE.
