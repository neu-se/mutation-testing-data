  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$PLACEHOLDER = array_map;
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a different function than `uncurryThis`. `array_map` applies a map operation to an array, while `uncurryThis` is a function that converts a curried function to a non-curried function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$PLACEHOLDER = object_defineProperty;
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_defineProperty` is a different value than `uncurryThis`. `object_defineProperty` is a function that defines a property on an object, while `uncurryThis` is a function that converts a curried function to a non-curried function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$PLACEHOLDER = QReturnValue;
```
This would result in different behavior because `QReturnValue` is a different function than `uncurryThis`.
