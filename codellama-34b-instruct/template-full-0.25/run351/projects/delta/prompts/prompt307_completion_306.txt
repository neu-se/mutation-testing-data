  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = (op.delete || op.retain) as number;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `as` keyword is used to assert that the `op.delete` or `op.retain` property is a number, which may not always be the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = (op.delete || op.retain) as string;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `as` keyword is used to assert that the `op.delete` or `op.retain` property is a string, which may not always be the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = (op.delete || op.retain) as any;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `as` keyword is used to assert that the `op.delete` or `op.retain` property is of any type, which may not always be the case.
