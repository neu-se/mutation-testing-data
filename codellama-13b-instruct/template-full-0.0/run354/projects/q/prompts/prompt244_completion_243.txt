  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a `Promise` object, whereas the original code fragment is calling the `inspect` method on the `promise` object, which is a `defer` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a `Promise` object, whereas the original code fragment is calling the `valueOf` method on the `promise` object, which is a `defer` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a `Promise`
