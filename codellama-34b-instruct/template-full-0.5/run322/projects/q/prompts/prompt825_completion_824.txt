  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler that returns a rejected promise with the message "Buggy code".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.resolve("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler that returns a resolved promise with the message "Buggy code".

DONE.
