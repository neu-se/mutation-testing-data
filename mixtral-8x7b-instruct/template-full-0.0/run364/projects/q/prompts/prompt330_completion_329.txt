 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Buggy error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message, which might cause a test to fail if it expects a specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the value being returned, which might cause a test to fail if it expects a specific error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
