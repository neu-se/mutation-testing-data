  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a unary negation operator, which would have negated the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment is simply a reference to the variable `x`, which would not negate its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a unary negation operator, which would have negated the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment is a binary negation operator, which would have negated the value of `x` and then negated the result, resulting in the same value as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a unary negation operator, which would have negated the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment is a binary negation operator, which would have negated the value of `x
