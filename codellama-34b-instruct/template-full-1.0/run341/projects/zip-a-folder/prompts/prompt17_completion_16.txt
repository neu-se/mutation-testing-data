  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + '../'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a relative path to the original `targetBasePath`, effectively changing the directory where the zip file is written to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `targetBasePath` string to upper case, which can change the behavior of the code that depends on the case-sensitivity of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `targetBasePath` to an empty string, which can cause errors if the code assumes that the path is always a valid directory.

DONE.
