  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.unshift` would add the task to the beginning of the queue instead of the end, which could cause the task to be executed before other tasks that were added to the queue before it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.pop` would remove the task from the queue instead of adding it, which could cause the task to not be executed at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.length = 0` would clear the queue, which could cause all tasks added to the queue to not be executed.

DONE.
