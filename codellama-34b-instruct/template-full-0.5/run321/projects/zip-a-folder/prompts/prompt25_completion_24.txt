  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option is set to `true` by default, which would cause the archive to be compressed with gzip even if the `gzip` option was not specified in the `archiverOptions` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zlib` option is set to `{ level: 9 }` by default, which would cause the archive to be compressed with zlib at level 9 even if the `zlib` option was not specified in the `archiverOptions` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { store: true, zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `store` option is set to `true` and the `zlib
