  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude + point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are combined, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
