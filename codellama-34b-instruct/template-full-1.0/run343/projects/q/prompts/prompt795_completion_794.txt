  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.inspect()` is a feature of the Q library's promise implementation, whereas `void 0` is not a valid JavaScript expression and would cause a SyntaxError if used in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a feature of the Q library's promise implementation, whereas `void 0` is not a valid JavaScript expression and would cause a SyntaxError if used in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JavaScript value, whereas `void 0` is not. `null` is also a falsy value, whereas `void 0` is a truthy value.

DONE.
