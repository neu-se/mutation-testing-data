  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of an op, but adding 1 to it would cause the length to be off by one, which could lead to errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of an op, but subtracting 1 from it would cause the length to be off by one, which could lead to errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of an op, but multiplying it by 2 would cause the length to be twice as long, which could lead to errors in the code.

DONE.
