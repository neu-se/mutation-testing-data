  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, but can also round up or down depending on the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.trunc` removes the fractional part of the number and returns the integer part.

DONE.
