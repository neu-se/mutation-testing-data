  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a non-integer exponent, which would cause the result to be a non-integer value. In the original code, the exponent is always an integer, so the result is always an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is a non-integer value, and the `Math.pow` function would be called with a non-integer exponent. In the original code, the exponent is always an integer, so the result is always an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function returns a non-integer value, and the `Math.pow` function would be called with a non-integer exponent. In the original code, the exponent is always an integer, so the result
