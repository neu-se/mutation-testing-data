 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the stack trace to a string, losing the ability to filter out unwanted frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `stack` property of the promise, which might not contain the desired stack trace information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error().stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object and gets its stack trace, which would not include the original error's stack trace.

DONE.
