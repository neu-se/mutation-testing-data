  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `c`, which would change the result of the division operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c * c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the value of `c`, which would change the result of the division operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a`, which would change the result of the division operation.

DONE.
