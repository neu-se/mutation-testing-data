  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character that is not a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash or backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\w+
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any word character (letter, digit, or underscore), whereas the original code fragment matches any character that is not a forward slash or backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]*
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches zero or more characters that are not forward slashes, whereas the original code fragment matches one or more characters.

DONE.
