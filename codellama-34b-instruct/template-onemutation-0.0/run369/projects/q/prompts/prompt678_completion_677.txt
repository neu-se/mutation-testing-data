  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the "post" method, but the replaced code fragment is using the "apply" method, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.
