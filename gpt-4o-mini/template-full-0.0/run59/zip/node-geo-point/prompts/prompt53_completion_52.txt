Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Ï†2
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of the second point instead of the change in longitude, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude of the first point instead of the difference in longitudes, which would yield an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the change in longitude altogether, leading to a constant bearing value regardless of the actual points being compared.

DONE.
