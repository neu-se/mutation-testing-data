  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property would be set to `false` instead of `true`, which could cause issues with module loading and exports.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property would be set to `undefined` instead of `true`, which could cause issues with module loading and exports.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property would be set to `null` instead of `true`, which could cause issues with module loading and exports.

DONE.
