  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, which is not what the original code fragment was intended to do. The original code fragment was intended to retrieve a deferred object from the `Q` object, not to create a new one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise returned by the `get` method, which is not what the original code fragment was intended to do. The original code fragment was intended to resolve the promise returned by the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise returned by the `get` method, which is not what the original code fragment was intended to do. The original code fragment was intended to reject the promise returned by the `get` method.

DONE.
