  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var //\index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because variable declaration would be interpreted as regex expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inbox.onnext //\index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because function call would be interpreted as regex expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log //\index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because function call would be interpreted as regex expression.

DONE.
