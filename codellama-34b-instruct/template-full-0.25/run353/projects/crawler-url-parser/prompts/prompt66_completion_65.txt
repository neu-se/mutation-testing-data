  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query into an array of key-value pairs, while the modified code fragment splits the search query into an array of strings using the "=" character as the delimiter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query into an array of key-value pairs, while the modified code fragment splits the search query into an array of strings using the "&" character as the delimiter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("?")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query into an array of key-value pairs, while the modified code fragment splits the search query into an array of strings using the "?" character as the delimiter.

DONE
