  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for inequality. This would cause the function to return "external" for links that are on the same domain as the page, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality on the domain property, while this new fragment checks for inequality on the host property. This would cause the function to return "external" for links that are on the same host as the page, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain != pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality on the domain property, while this new fragment checks for inequality on the subdomain property. This would cause the function to return "external" for links that are on
