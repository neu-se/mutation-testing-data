  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a file. In the original code, the `path.extname` method is used to extract the file extension from the `options.dest` path, and the `path.basename` method would not provide the same information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a file. In the original code, the `path.extname` method is used to extract the file extension from the `options.dest` path, and the `path.dirname` method would not provide the same information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(path.dirname(options.dest))
```
This would result in
