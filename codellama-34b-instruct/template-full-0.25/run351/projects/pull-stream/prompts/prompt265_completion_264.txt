  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the `nextChunk` function, while `null` is a constant value that does not depend on any input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the `nextChunk` function, while `undefined` is a constant value that does not depend on any input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the `nextChunk` function, while `data.length` is a reference to the `length` property of the `data` object, which may or may not be the same as the `data` parameter.

DONE.
