Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/g, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the global flag `g` in the regular expression will cause the test to match multiple occurrences in the string, which is not the intended behavior for pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the code incorrectly removes the last character of the word before adding 's', which would not correctly pluralize words ending in 'ics'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pluralization rule to append 'es' instead of keeping the word unchanged, which is incorrect for words like 'mathematics' or 'statistics'.

DONE.
