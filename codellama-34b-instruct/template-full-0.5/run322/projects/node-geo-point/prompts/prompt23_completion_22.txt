  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, leading to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDistance` and `calculateBearing` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'altitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `altitude` property is not defined in the `LatLng` object, and therefore would not be accessible in the `fromObject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` property is not defined in the `LatLng` object, and therefore would not be accessible in the `fromObject` method.

DONE.
