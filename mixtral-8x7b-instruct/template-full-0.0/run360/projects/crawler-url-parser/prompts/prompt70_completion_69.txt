 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$ => cheerio.load(data, {xmlMode: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable XML mode for the Cheerio load function, potentially causing issues if the input data is not XML.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$ => cheerio.load(data, {decodeEntities: false})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable entity decoding for the Cheerio load function, causing issues with any entities in the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$ => cheerio.load(data, {lowerCaseTags: true})
