  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the list of URL values to be returned in reverse order, potentially leading to unexpected results if the code assumes a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().filter(value => value.includes('www'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return URL values that contain the string "www", potentially leading to an incorrect number of URLs being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().slice(5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first 5 URL values, potentially leading to an incorrect number of URLs being extracted.

DONE.
