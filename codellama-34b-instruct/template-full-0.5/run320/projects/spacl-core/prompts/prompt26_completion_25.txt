  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would allow for negative values of `min`, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would allow for `min` to be equal to 0, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would allow for `min` to be not equal to 0, which is not allowed in the original code.

DONE.
