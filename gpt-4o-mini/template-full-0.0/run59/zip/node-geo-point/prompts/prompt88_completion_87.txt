Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using `sin` instead of `cos` would incorrectly calculate the sine of the angular distance, leading to an incorrect result in the destination point calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cos(Î´)` with a constant value of `1` would ignore the actual angular distance, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using `tan` instead of `cos` would yield an incorrect value for the cosine of the angular distance, which would affect the calculations for the destination point.

DONE.
