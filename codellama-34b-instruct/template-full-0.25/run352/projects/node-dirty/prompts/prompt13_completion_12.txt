  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the callback is already in the list, and if it is, it will not be added again. In the original code, the callback is always added to the list, which could result in duplicate callbacks being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property checks if the list is empty, and if it is, it will not add the callback to the list. In the original code, the callback is always added to the list, which could result in duplicate callbacks being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.indexOf(cb) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method checks if the callback is already in the list, and if it is not, it will be added to the list. In the original code,
