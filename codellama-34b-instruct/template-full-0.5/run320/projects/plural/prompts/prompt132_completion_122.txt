  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.typeof` is a non-standard property that is not supported in all browsers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.type
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.type` is a non-standard property that is not supported in all browsers.

DONE.
