  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x\|ch\|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `|` operator to match either "x" or "ch" or "s" at the end of the string, while this code fragment would match the literal string "x|ch|s" at the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x|ch|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `|` operator to match either "x" or "ch" or "s" at the end of the string, while this code fragment would match either "x" or "ch" or "s" at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` anchor to match the end of the string, while this code fragment would match any of
