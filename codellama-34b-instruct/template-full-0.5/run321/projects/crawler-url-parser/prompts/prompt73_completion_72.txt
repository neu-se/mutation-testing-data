  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for the source of an image, while the `href` attribute is used for the URL of a link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'alt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `alt` attribute is used for the alternative text of an image, while the `href` attribute is used for the URL of a link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'title'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `title` attribute is used for the title of an element, while the `href` attribute is used for the URL of a link.

DONE.
