  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be reversed before being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause unexpected behavior if the code relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `args` array would be removed before being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause unexpected behavior if the code relies on the presence of that element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat([42])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be concatenated with the value `42` before being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause unexpected behavior if the code does not expect additional arguments to be present.

DONE.
