  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is not `null` or `undefined`, regardless of whether `currentUrl.url` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is not `null` or `undefined`, and `currentUrl.url` is a non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url !== null && currentUrl.url !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is not `null` or `undefined`, and `currentUrl.url` is a non-empty string and not `null`.

DONE.
