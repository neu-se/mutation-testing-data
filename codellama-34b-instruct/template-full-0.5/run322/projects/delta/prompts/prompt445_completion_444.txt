  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the current element in the array to null, which would affect the behavior of the rest of the code.

DONE.
