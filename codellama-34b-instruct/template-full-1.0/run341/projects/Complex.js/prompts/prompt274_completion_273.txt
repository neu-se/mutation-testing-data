  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` and `im` properties are being swapped, which would change the resulting complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` and `re` properties are being added together, which would change the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` and `re` properties are being subtracted, which would change the resulting complex number.

DONE.
