  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` is a function that resolves a relative URL to a base URL, while `URL.parse` is a function that parses a URL and returns an object with its components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` is a function that takes an object with URL components and formats them into a valid URL string, while `URL.parse` takes a URL string and returns an object with its components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr).resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse(baseUrlStr).resolve` is a function that resolves a relative URL to a base URL, while `URL.parse` is a function that parses a URL and returns an object with its components.

DONE.
