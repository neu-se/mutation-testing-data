  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object to `baseUrl`, effectively overwriting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `host` property of the `baseUrl` object to `baseUrl`, effectively overwriting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = baseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `pathname` property of the `baseUrl` object to `baseUrl`, effectively overwriting it.

DONE.
