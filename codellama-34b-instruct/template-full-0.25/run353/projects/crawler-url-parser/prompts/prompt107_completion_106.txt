  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.baseurl` is a different property than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be set in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.protocol` is a different property than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be set in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.host` is a different property than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be set in all cases.

DONE.
