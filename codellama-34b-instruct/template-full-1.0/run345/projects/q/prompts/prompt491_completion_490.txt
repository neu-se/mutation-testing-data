  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "untrackRejection" function with the current value of "this", which is the promise that was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "untrackRejection" function with no arguments, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "untrackRejection" function with the "reason" argument, which would likely have a different effect on the code.

DONE.
