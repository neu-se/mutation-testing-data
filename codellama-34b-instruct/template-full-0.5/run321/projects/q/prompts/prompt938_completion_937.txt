  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the third argument, instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced starting from the second element, instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be sliced starting from the third element, instead of the second.

DONE.
