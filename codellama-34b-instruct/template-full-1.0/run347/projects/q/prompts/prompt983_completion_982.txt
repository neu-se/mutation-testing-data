  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the new code uses the `makeNodeResolver` method, which may not have the same error handling capabilities.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the new code uses the `catch` method, which may not have the same error handling capabilities.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the new code uses the `then` method with a re
