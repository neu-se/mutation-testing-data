  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isFinite = function() { return false; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method would always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually finite. This would cause the `isNaN` and `isFinite` methods to return incorrect results, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.valueOf = function() { return NaN; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would always return `NaN`, even if the complex number has a valid real or imaginary part. This would cause the `valueOf` method to return incorrect results, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Complex` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.toVector = function() { return [NaN, NaN]; };
```
This would result in
