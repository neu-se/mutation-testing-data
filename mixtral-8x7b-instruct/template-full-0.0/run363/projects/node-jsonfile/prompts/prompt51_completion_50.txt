 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'JSON.stringify'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string 'JSON.stringify' instead of calling the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval('JSON.stringify')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the string as JavaScript code, which can have security implications and is generally slower than direct function invocation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.parse` function instead of `JSON.stringify`, which would likely result in a runtime error when passing an object to the `stringify` function.

DONE.
