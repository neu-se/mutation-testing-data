  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function, which is not a valid method for a function. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would result in the `errback` function being called instead of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with the `next` argument, which is not a valid method for a function. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would result in the `errback` function being called instead of the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "return")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind`
