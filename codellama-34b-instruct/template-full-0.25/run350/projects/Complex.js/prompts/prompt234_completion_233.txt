  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the less than operator. This could cause the code to produce different results for inputs where `a` is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the greater than operator. This could cause the code to produce different results for inputs where `a` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the not equal to operator. This could cause the code to produce different results for inputs where `a` is equal to zero.

DONE.
