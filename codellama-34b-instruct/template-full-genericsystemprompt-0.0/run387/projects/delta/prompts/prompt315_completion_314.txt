  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the op, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling operations with lengths that are not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the op, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling operations with lengths that are not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the op, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling operations with lengths that are not equal to 1.

DONE.
