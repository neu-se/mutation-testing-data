Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: null, configurable: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `value` of the `error.stack` property to `null` instead of the concatenated stack trace, and it makes the property non-configurable, preventing any further modifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: "Error occurred", configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a static string "Error occurred" to the `error.stack` property instead of the actual stack trace, which would mislead any debugging efforts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: promise.stack, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the `promise.stack` to `error.stack`, which may not contain the relevant error stack trace, leading to confusion in understanding the source of the error.

DONE.
