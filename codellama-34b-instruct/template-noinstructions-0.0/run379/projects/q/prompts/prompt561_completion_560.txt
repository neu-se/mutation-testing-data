  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.value` is not defined in the original code, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is not defined in the original code, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is not defined in the original code, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
