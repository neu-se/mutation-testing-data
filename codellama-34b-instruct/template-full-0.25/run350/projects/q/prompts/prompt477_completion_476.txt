  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at the specified index plus one instead of the element at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at the specified index multiplied by two instead of the element at the specified index.

DONE.
