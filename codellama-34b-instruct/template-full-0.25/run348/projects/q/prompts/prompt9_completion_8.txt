  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `foo` property would cause the `define.amd` check to fail, potentially causing the code to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `bar` property would cause the `define.amd` check to fail, potentially causing the code to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `baz` property would cause the `define.amd` check to fail, potentially causing the code to execute differently.

DONE.
