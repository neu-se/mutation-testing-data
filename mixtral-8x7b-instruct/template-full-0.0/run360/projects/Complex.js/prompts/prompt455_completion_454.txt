 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(this.re + this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts is NaN, instead of checking if either part is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Number.isNaN(this.re) || Number.isNaN(this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Number.isNaN` method, which checks if the value is NaN and is not affected by other non-numeric values, unlike the original `isNaN` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.is(this.re, Object.is(this.im, NaN))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.is` method, which checks if the real and imaginary parts are both exactly equal to NaN, instead of checking if either part is NaN.

DONE
