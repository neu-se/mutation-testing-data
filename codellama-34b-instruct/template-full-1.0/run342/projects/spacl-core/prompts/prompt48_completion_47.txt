  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push('non-existent property')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `non-existent property` pushes a non-existent property to the `props` array, which would lead to unexpected behavior when accessing the `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` pushes an undefined value to the `props` array, which would lead to unexpected behavior when accessing the `props` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props = ['non-existent property']
```
This would result in different behavior because `props` is being reassigned to an array with a single element, `non-existent property`, which would lead to unexpected behavior when accessing the `props` array.

DONE.
