  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < this.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one iteration less than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one iteration more than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < this.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one iteration more than the original code.

DONE.
