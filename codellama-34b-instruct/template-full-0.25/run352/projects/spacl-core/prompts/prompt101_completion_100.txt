  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `verb` string with the string `'x'`, resulting in a different value than the original `verb` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to uppercase, resulting in a different value than the original `verb` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `verb` string, resulting in a different value than the original `verb` string.

DONE.
