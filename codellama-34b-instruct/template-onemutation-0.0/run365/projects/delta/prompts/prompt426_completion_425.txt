  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.delete` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is not a number. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
