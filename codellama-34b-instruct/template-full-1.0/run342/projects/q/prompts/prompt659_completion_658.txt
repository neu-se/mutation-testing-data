  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of skipping the first two arguments, it would skip the first argument and include the second argument in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of skipping the first two arguments, it would skip the first three arguments and include the fourth argument in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...arguments, arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of skipping the first two arguments, it would skip all but the last argument in the array.

DONE.
