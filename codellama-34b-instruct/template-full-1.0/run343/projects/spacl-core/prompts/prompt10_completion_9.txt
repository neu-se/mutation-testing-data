  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not checking for the version number, so it will always match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is looking for a different pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is still looking for the same pattern, but without the extra checks for the version number.

DONE.
