  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `base` object is used as a fallback value in `invert()`, whereas `undefined` would cause the `base` object to be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid object property name, whereas `base` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a built-in object with different properties than `base`.

DONE.
