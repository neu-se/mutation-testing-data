  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles fulfilled promises, while `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises. Replacing `_rejected` with `_fulfilled` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value, rather than rejected with an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that explicitly rejects a promise with a given exception, whereas `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises. Replacing `_rejected` with `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with a different exception, which could affect the behavior of subsequent `then` callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that raises an exception, whereas `_rejected` is a
