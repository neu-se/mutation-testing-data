  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment `path.join`:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it joins `options.dest` and `decodedBasename` using `path.join`, which may result in a different file path than originally intended if there are any special characters in the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, basename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it joins `options.dest` and `basename` using `path.join`, which may result in a different file path than originally intended if there are any special characters in the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, decodeURIComponent(decodedBasename))
```
This would result in different behavior because it first decodes the
