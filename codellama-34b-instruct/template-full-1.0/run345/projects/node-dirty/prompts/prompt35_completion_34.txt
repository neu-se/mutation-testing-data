  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to `undefined`, which is different from the original code fragment where the value is set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the third argument to `set()`, which is different from the original code fragment where `cb` is passed as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, null, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to `null`, which is different from the original code fragment where the value is set to `undefined`.

DONE.
