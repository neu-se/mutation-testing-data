  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it has a different purpose. `search` returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string, while `match` returns an array of matches.

DONE.
