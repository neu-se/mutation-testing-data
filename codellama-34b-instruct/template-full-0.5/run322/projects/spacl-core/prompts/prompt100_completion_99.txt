  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the specified index. In this case, the original code fragment `path` is replaced with `path.substring(1)`, which would return a new string that is a subset of the original `path` string, starting from the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method returns a new string that is the original string converted to uppercase. In this case, the original code fragment `path` is replaced with `path.toUpperCase()`, which would return a new string that is the original `path` string converted to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of strings split by
