  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this modified code fragment checks if it's an object. This could cause the `retain` branch to be taken even if `nextOp.insert` is not a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this modified code fragment checks if it's not a string.
