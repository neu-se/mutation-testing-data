  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse().
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method mutates the original array, whereas the original code fragment only reads the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(1).
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the original array, omitting the first element, whereas the original code fragment reads the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop().
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the array, whereas the original code fragment only reads the entire array.

DONE.
