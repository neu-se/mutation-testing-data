  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero()` checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if the complex number is not a number, while `isZero()` checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if the complex number is finite, while `isZero()` checks if the complex number is zero.

DONE.
