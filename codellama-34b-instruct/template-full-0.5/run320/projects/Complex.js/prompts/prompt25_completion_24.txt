  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which has a higher precedence than the `*` operator, so it would be evaluated first. In this alternative code fragment, the `*` operator is evaluated first, which could result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which has a higher precedence than the `*` operator, so it would be evaluated first. In this alternative code fragment, the `*` operator is evaluated first, which could result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b / 2
```
