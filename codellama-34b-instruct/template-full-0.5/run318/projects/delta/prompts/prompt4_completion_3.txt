  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would always return the `a` object, regardless of the values of `b` and `keepNull`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would always return the `b` object, regardless of the values of `a` and `keepNull`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would always return an empty object, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
