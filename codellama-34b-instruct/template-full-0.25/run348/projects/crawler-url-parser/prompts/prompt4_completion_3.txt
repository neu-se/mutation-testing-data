  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both operands to be true for the expression to be true. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which only requires one operand to be true for the expression to be true. This means that if `currentUrlStr` is truthy, the replacement code fragment will evaluate to true, regardless of the value of `_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both operands to be true for the expression to be true. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) to negate the value of `currentUrlStr`, and then uses the logical
