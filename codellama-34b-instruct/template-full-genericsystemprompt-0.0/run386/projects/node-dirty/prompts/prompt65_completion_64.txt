  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that closes the write stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the write stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` are methods that close the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that pauses the write stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` are methods that close the write stream.

DONE.
