Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = function() { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `defer` function to return an empty object instead of a deferred object, which would break the promise handling mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `defer` to `null` would cause any subsequent calls to `defer()` to throw an error, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = function() { return { makeNodeResolver: function() { return "not a resolver"; } }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `makeNodeResolver` method to return a string instead of a function, which would cause the promise resolution to fail when it tries to invoke the resolver.

DONE.
