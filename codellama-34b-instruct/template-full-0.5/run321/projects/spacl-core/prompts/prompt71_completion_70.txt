  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `verb`, which would cause the `query` method to return `false` for any action that was previously allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'xyz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator concatenates the value of `verb` with the string `'xyz'`, which would cause the `query` method to return `false` for any action that was previously allowed, as long as the concatenated string does not match any of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts the value of `verb` to lowercase, which would cause the `query` method to return `false` for any action that was previously allowed, as long as the lowercase version of the action does not match any of the rules.
