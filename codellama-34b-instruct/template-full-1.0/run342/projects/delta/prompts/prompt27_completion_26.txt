  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(undefined)` would throw a `TypeError`, whereas `Object.keys(attributes)` would return an array of keys in the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"attributes"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys("attributes")` would return an array containing the string "attributes", whereas `Object.keys(attributes)` would return an array of keys in the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys({})` would return an empty array, whereas `Object.keys(attributes)` would return an array of keys in the `attributes` object.

DONE.
