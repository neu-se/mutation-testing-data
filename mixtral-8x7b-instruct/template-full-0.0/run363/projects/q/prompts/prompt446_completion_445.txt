 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not store the promise in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, but instead an empty array, which would prevent the unhandled rejection from being processed correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not store any value in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would prevent the unhandled rejection from being processed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store an integer in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the expected type (a promise) and would prevent the unhandled rejection from being processed correctly.

DONE.
