Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes `data.timezones` instead of `data`, which would lead to an undefined or incorrect timezone mapping for the country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data).nonExistentProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a non-existent property on the result of `getTimezonesMap`, which would lead to an error or undefined value for `tzMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data)[id].current
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `tzMap` is always defined and directly accesses the `current` property, which could lead to a runtime error if `tzMap` is undefined or if the `id` does not exist in the map.

DONE.
