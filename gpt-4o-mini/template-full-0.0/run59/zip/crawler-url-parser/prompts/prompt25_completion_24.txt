Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `baseUrlStr` to always be treated as an absolute URL with the HTTP protocol, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of relative URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the fragment with a double slash, which is not a valid URL fragment and could lead to unexpected results when resolving the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `baseUrlStr` to the string "undefined", which could cause the URL parsing logic to fail or behave incorrectly, as it would be treated as a literal string rather than a valid URL.

DONE.
