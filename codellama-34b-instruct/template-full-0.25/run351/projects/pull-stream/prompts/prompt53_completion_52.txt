  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is an object, but not necessarily a plain object, whereas the original code fragment checks if `s` is a plain object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is a function, but not necessarily a constructor function, whereas the original code fragment checks if `s` is a plain object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is an array, but not necessarily a plain array, whereas the original code fragment checks if `s` is a plain object.

DONE.
