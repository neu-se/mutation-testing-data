Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the parsed base URL object to the string representation of the base URL, potentially leading to incorrect type handling and comparisons in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `gettype` function instead of the actual base URL, which could lead to errors or unexpected results when trying to access properties of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the base URL to the current page URL, which could lead to incorrect type classification in the `gettype` function, as it would be comparing the link URL against the page URL instead of the intended base URL.

DONE.
