  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of a policy object, causing the `query` method to return `null` instead of a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of a policy object, causing the `query` method to return `null` instead of a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a policy object with the name "invalid" instead of the expected policy object, causing the `query` method to return a different result.

DONE.
