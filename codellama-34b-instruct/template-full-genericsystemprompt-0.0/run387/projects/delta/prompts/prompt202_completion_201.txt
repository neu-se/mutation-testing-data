  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with a non-numeric argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
