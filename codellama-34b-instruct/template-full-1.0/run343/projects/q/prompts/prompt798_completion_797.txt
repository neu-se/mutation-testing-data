  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in a different behavior, since using the `typeof` operator on a promise would return "object", not "Not a Number", which could cause a bug in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in a different behavior, since the `null` value would cause a TypeError when used in a `Q.when` method that expects a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in a different behavior, since the `undefined` value would cause an error when used in a `Q.when` method that expects a promise.

DONE.
