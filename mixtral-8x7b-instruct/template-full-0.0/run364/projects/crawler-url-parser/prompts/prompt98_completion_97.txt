 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the mapping for the current URL from the `urlMap` instead of checking if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'urlMap'.hasOwnProperty(currentUrl.url)
