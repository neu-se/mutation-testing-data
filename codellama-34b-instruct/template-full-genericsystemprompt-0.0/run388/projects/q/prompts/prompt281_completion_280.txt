  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
