 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` only takes one argument, while `Math.atan2` takes two. This change would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, as the calculation of `λ2` would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second argument. This change would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, as the calculation of `λ2` would be incorrect due to the change in sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the arguments. This change would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, as the calculation of `λ2` would be incorrect due to the swapped arguments.
