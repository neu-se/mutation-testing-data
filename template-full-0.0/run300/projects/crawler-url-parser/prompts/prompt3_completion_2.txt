  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr` is a string, and `null` is an object, so the two values will never be equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the two values will never be equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr` is a string, and `'undefined'` is a string literal, so the two values will never be equal.

DONE.
