  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called on the `this._data` object with the `key` variable as an argument, which would return the value associated with the `key` in the `this._data` object. In the original code, the `get` method was called with the `key` variable as an argument, but the result was not used.

DONE.
