  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
        Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the second condition is now checking if the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex number is less than or equal to half the EPSILON value, which would cause the function to return true even if the imaginary part is not close to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
        Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the second condition is now checking if the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex number is less than or equal to twice the EPSILON value, which would cause the function
