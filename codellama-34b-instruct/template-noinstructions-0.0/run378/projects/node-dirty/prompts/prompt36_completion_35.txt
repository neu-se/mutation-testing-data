  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped in the forEach loop, causing the loop to iterate over the values instead of the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val, extra]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra variable would be undefined, causing the loop to iterate over the keys and values, but also including an extra variable that is not used in the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val, ...rest]
```
This would result in different behavior because the rest variable would be an array containing the remaining elements of the map, causing the loop to iterate over the keys and values, as well as the remaining elements of the map.

DONE.
