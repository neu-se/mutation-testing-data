  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a different function than `isNodeFrame`, and it has a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a function that takes a `stackLine` argument, and it would be called with the `stackLine` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNodeFrame` is a negation of the `isNodeFrame` function, and it would return the opposite result.

DONE.
