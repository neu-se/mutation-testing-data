  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.size && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!this._queue.size) && this._waitForDrain`, which would have a different result than the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.size || this._waitForDrain === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `==`, which would have a different result than the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.size || this._waitForDrain !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `==`, which would have a different result than the original expression.

DONE.
