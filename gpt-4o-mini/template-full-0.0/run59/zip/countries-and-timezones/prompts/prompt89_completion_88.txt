Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to always return `null` for the `main` variable, leading to the `getCountryForTimezone` function returning `null` instead of the first country for the specified timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to always return an empty array, as destructuring an empty object would not provide any countries, resulting in `main` being `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return `undefined` for the `main` variable, which would lead to the `getCountryForTimezone` function returning `null`, similar to the first option, but with a different type of falsy value.

DONE.
