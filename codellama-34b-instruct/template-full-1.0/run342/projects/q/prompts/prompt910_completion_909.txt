  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to the `.denodeify` function instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.denodeify` function would receive an empty array instead of the array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.denodeify` function would receive a null value instead of the array of arguments.

DONE.
