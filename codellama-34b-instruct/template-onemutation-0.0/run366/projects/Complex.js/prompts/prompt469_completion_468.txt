  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than 0, but the new code fragment checks if `b` is greater than 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `b` is negative, which would result in the `ret` variable being set to an incorrect value.

DONE.
