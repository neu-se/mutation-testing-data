  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This change will cause the function to return the second element of the `rule` array instead of the first, which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This change will cause the function to return the third element of the `rule` array instead of the first, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This change will cause the function to return the fourth element of the `rule` array instead of the first, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
