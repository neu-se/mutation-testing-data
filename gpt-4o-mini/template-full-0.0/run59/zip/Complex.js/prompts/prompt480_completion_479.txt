Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is zero instead of checking if it is NaN, which would lead to incorrect results when the real or imaginary parts are NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return false regardless of the values of `this['re']` and `this['im']`, thus incorrectly indicating that the complex number is infinite when it may not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, which is not the same as checking for NaN, leading to incorrect identification of complex numbers that are actually NaN.

DONE.
