  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolvedPromise` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, and `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, which is always truthy. Therefore, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `resolvedPromise` is not resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isResolved()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isResolved()` method checks if the promise has been resolved, and if so, returns `true`. Therefore, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` only if `resolvedPromise` is resolved
