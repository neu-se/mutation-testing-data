  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(start - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `start - index` elements, rather than the original `end - index` elements. This could potentially cause the iterator to skip over important operations in the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(end - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `end - index` elements, rather than the original `start - index` elements. This could potentially cause the iterator to skip over important operations in the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(index - start);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `index - start` elements, rather than the original `end - index` elements. This could potentially cause the iterator to skip over important operations
