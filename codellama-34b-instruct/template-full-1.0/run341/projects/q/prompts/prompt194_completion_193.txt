  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt3[2];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a function that expects a string or number as input and returns the number, while `return attempt3[2]` would return the third element of the array `attempt3`, which may not be a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt3[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a function that expects a string or number as input and returns the number, while `return attempt3[1]` would return the second element of the array `attempt3`, which may not be a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt3[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a function that expects a string or number as input and returns the number, while `return attempt3[0]` would return the first element of the array `attempt3`, which may not be a number.
