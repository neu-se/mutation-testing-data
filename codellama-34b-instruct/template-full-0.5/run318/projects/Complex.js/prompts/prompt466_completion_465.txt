  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `b` is equal to 0, while the replaced code is checking if `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `b` is equal to 0, while the replaced code is checking if `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `b` is equal to 0, while the replaced code is checking if `a` is not equal to `b`.

DONE.
