  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the result of the `Number.isInteger()` method to be a boolean value, but the new code would always return `true` because `0` is an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the result of the `Number.isInteger()` method to be a number, but the new code would always return `false` because a string is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the result of the `Number.isInteger()` method to be a number, but the new code would always return `false` because an empty array is not a number.

DONE.
