  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `loop` variable is set to `true` unconditionally, whereas in the original code it is only set to `true` if the `test` function returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `data` arguments, whereas in the original code it is only called with the `end` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, function (end, data) {
  if (!end && !test(data)) {
    return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb)
  }
  cb(end, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a different callback function that has a different behavior than the original callback function.

DONE.
