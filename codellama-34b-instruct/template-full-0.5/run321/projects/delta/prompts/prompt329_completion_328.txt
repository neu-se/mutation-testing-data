  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `op.retain` or `op.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `|| true` would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `op.retain` or `op.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& op.attributes.length > 0` would cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if `op.attributes` is not an empty object.

DONE.
