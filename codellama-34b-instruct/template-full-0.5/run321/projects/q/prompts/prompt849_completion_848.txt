  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject(error);`, which would reject the promise with the given error. Replacing it with `null;` would reject the promise with a `null` value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject(error);`, which would reject the promise with the given error. Replacing it with `undefined;` would reject the promise with an `undefined` value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject(error);`, which would reject the promise with the given error. Replacing it with `0;` would reject the promise with a `0` value instead.

DONE.
