  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the denominator of the expression to be different, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 would cause the denominator of the expression to be different, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the denominator of the expression to be different, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
