  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise object, so calling `nfcall` on it would fail with a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise object, so calling `nfcall` on it would fail with a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` expects a function as its first argument, but a promise object does not have a `then` method, so it would fail with a type error.

DONE.
