  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is defined in the current scope, but the `+ 1` operator would change its value, which could affect the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
