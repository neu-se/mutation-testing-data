  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is a different function than `Math.cos` and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * Math.sin` is a different expression than `Math.cos` and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` is the inverse of `Math.sin` and would produce a different result for the same input.

DONE.
