  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a syntax error, and this replacement code fragment is syntactically correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a syntax error, and this replacement code fragment is syntactically correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(0));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a syntax error, and this replacement code fragment is syntactically correct.

DONE.
