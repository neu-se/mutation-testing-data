  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the zoom level to be incremented by 1, resulting in a different tile being selected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the zoom level to be multiplied by 2, resulting in a different tile being selected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the zoom level to be decremented by 1, resulting in a different tile being selected.

DONE.
