  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(undefined)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then(function() { return Q.reject(); })` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
