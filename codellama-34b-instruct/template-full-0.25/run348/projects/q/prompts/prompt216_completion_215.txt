  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a rejected promise with the value as the reason, rather than a resolved promise with the value as the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `then` method, rather than a promise that is resolved with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).then(function (result) {
    return result;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `then` method, rather than a promise that is resolved with the value.

DONE.
