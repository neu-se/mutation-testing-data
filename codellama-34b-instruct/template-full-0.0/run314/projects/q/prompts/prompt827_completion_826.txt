  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and setting it to `null` would prevent it from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error whenever `Q.onerror` is called, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console whenever `Q.onerror` is called, which would allow the program to continue running but would also change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
