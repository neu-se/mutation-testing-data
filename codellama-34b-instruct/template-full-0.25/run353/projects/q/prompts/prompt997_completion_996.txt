  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not called, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be pushed to the `deferred.reject` method instead of the `deferred.resolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called directly, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately instead of being resolved with the `deferred.resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called directly, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately instead of being rejected with the `deferred.reject` method.

DONE.
