  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line ending from a newline character to a carriage return and newline character, which could cause issues with the parsing of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line ending from a newline character to a tab character, which could cause issues with the parsing of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the line ending altogether, which could cause issues with the parsing of the data.

DONE.
