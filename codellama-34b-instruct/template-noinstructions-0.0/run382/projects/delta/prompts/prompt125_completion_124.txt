  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than or equal to `firstLeft`, but the new code fragment only checks if the peeked op is an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than or equal to `firstLeft`, but the new code fragment checks if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than `firstLeft`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() > first
