 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method would be called on the input object directly, instead of using the `values` array. This could cause issues if the input object has duplicate keys or keys with non-string values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return an array of random keys from the input object, instead of all of the keys. This could cause issues if the order of the keys is important for the correct functioning of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(x => x !== x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the filter function would remove all elements from the values array, resulting in an empty array being returned. This could cause issues if the code downstream relies on the returned array having at least one element.

DONE.
