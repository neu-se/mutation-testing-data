  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the diff function would be comparing the wrong strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the diff function would be comparing the characters of the first string instead of the strings themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the diff function would be comparing the uppercase version of the first string instead of the original string.

DONE.
