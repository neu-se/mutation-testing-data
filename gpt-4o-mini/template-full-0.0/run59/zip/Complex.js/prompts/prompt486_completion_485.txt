Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperties
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.defineProperties` is used to define multiple properties at once, which could lead to unintended side effects if the properties are not defined correctly or if they conflict with existing properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "Complex", { value: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `Complex` property to `false`, which changes the expected behavior of the `Complex` object and could lead to errors when other parts of the code expect it to be the `Complex` constructor function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "default", { value: null });
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `default` property to `null`, which could break any code that relies on the `default` export being the `Complex` constructor, leading to runtime errors when trying to instantiate a complex number.

DONE.
