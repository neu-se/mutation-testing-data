  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("Success")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a fulfilled promise with the value "Success" instead of a fulfilled promise with an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000).then(() => Q.reject("Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise after a delay of 1 second instead of a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
