Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the first element of the `values` array to `stream`, which may not be a valid stream and could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to read from it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `stream` to `null`, which would cause the subsequent calls to `_read` to fail, as there would be no valid stream to read from.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the length of the `values` array to `stream`, which is a number and not a valid stream, leading to errors when attempting to invoke stream methods.

DONE.
