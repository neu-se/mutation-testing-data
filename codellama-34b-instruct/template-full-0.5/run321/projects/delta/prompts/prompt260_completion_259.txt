  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for equality between `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, whereas the replaced code fragment is checking for equality between `thisOp.delete` and `otherOp.delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for equality between `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, whereas the replaced code fragment is checking for equality between `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for equality between `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, whereas the replaced code fragment is checking for equality between `thisOp.attributes` and `
