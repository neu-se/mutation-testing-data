  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value `val` is undefined, but if we replace it with `undefined`, the check will always pass, even if the value is not actually undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `val` parameter as is, but if we replace it with `Math.round(val)`, the value will be rounded to the nearest integer before being stored in the cache, which could result in unexpected behavior if the value is not meant to be an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc" + val.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `val` parameter as is, but if we replace it with the concatenation of the string "abc" and the string representation of `val`, the value will be stored in the cache with the string "abc
