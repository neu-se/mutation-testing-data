  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the string `"undefined"` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the number `0` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
