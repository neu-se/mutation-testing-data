 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'div' method would return a different result when the divisor's imaginary part is positive and the divisor is not real.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'div' method would return a different result when the divisor's imaginary part is zero and the divisor is not real.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'div' method would throw a division by zero error when the divisor's imaginary part is zero.

DONE.
