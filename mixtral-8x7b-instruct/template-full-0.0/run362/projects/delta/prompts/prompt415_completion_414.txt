 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume the next operation type is 'insert', which might not be the case, and could lead to incorrect index calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.currentType
