  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any trailing slashes from the URL, while the new code fragment would always append a slash to the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any trailing slashes from the URL, while the new code fragment would always remove any trailing slashes from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any trailing slashes from the URL, while the new code fragment would always append a hash symbol to the URL.

DONE.
