  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when `end` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(), null
```
This would result in different behavior because `generate()` is a function call, and it will cause the function to return the result of the function call instead of `null` when `end` is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, generate
```
This would result in different behavior because `generate` is a function reference, and it will cause the function to return the function reference instead of `null` when `end` is not provided.

DONE.
