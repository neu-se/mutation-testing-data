  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of an array, whereas the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element of an array, whereas the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.unshift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift()` method adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
