  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecate` function is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecate` function is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (promises) {
    return when(promises, function (promises) {
        promises = array_map(promises, Q);
        return when(all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
            return when(promise, noop, noop);
        })), function () {
            return promises;
        });
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecate` function is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
