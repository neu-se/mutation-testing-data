  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new SyntaxError('Invalid Param'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws an error if the argument to `parser_exit` is undefined or null. However, the new code always throws an error, regardless of the value of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws an error if the argument to `parser_exit` is undefined or null. However, the new code does not throw an error if the argument is null, because null is a valid value for the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(void);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws an error if the argument to `parser_exit` is undefined or null. However, the new code does not throw an error if the argument is void, because void is not a valid value for the argument.

DONE
