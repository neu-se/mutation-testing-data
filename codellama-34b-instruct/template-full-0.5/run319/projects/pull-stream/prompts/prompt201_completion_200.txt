  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is called when the `read` function is called with an `abort` parameter, whereas `cb` is a callback function that is called when the `read` function is called with a `null` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a parameter passed to the `read` function, whereas `cb` is a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(aborted)` is a function call that passes the `aborted` parameter to the `abortCb` function, whereas `cb` is a callback function that is called when the `read` function is called with a `null` parameter.

DONE.
