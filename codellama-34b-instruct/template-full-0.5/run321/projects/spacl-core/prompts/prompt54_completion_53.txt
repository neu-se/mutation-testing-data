  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.pop` would remove the last element of the `parts` array, rather than adding a new element to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.unshift` would add a new element to the beginning of the `parts` array, rather than the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.push('foo')` would add the string `'foo'` to the end of the `parts` array, rather than the original code fragment which adds the result of the `compile` function.

DONE.
