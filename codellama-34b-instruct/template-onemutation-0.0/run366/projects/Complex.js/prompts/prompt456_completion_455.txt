  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['im'] === 0) {
  return this['re'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, but the new code fragment also checks if the real part is equal to 0. If the real part is not equal to 0, the new code fragment will return a different value than the original code fragment.
