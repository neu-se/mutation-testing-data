 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass 0 to the `progressListener` instead of the actual progress value, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the application if the listener assumes it will always receive a progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass an empty object to the `progressListener` instead of the actual progress value, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the application if the listener assumes it will always receive a progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` to the `progressListener` instead of the actual progress value, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the application if the listener assumes it will always receive a progress value.

DONE.
