  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` instead of `false`, which would cause the `querycount` property to be set to `1` instead of `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` instead of `false`, which would cause the `querycount` property to be set to `1` instead of `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` instead of `false`, which would cause the `querycount` property to be set to `1` instead of `0`.

DONE.
