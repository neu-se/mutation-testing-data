  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.shift` would return the first element of the array, whereas `arr.pop` would return the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements except the first, whereas `arr.pop` would return the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.reverse()` would return a new array containing the elements of the original array in reverse order, whereas `arr.pop` would return the last element.

DONE.
