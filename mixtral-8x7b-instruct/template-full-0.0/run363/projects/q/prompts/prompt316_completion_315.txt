 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the strict comparison with `undefined` is replaced with a loose comparison, which might not catch cases where `inspect` has been redefined to a falsy value like `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect && inspect !== Object.prototype.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `inspect` is not only truthy but also not the same as the `Object.prototype.inspect` method, which might be the case if someone has replaced the `inspect` property with a different function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof inspect === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `inspect` is a function, but it doesn't check if it's the original `inspect` function provided to the `Promise` constructor. This could lead to unexpected behavior if someone replaces the `ins
