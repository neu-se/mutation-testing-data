  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the imaginary part to be considered non-zero even if it is very small.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the imaginary part to be considered non-Infinity even if it is very large.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the real part to be considered non-zero even if it is very small.

DONE.
