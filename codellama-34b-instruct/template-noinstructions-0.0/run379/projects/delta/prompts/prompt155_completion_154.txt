  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext` is a property that returns the iterator itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next element in the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext` returns the iterator itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext` returns the iterator itself.

DONE.
