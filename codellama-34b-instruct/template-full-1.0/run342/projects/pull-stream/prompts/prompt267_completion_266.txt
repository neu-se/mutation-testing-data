  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end !== true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` parameter is checked against `true` instead of being compared with the `null` value. This would cause the function to exit early if `end` is not equal to `true` instead of checking if `read` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === true && typeof read !== 'function')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` parameter is checked to see if it is a function before checking if `end` is equal to `true`. This would cause the function to exit early if `read` is not a function, regardless of what `end` contains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === 'true')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` parameter is checked to see if it is the string 'true' instead of checking if it is equal to the boolean `true`. This would cause
