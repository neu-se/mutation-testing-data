  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of the argument `a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of half the argument `a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates twice the argument `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of the square of the argument `a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the square of the argument `a`.

DONE.
