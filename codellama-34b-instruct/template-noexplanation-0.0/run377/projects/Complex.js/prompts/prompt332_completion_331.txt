  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if `b` is equal to `-1` instead of `1`. This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-1`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original, it checks if `b` is not equal to `1`. This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is not equal to `1`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This code fragment checks if `b` is equal to `0`. This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `0`, which is different from the original behavior.
