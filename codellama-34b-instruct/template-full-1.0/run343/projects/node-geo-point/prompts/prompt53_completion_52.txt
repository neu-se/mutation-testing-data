  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const θ = atan2(y, -x);
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the bearing would be based on a different angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const θ = atan2(cos(φ1) * -y - sin(φ1) * x, x * cos(φ1) * -y - sin(φ1) * -x);
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the bearing would be based on a different angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const θ = atan2(x * cos(φ1) * -y - sin(φ1) * -x, cos(φ1) * x * -y - sin(φ1) * -x);
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the bearing would be based on a different angle.

DONE.
