  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` and `getTimezone` have different return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` returns a single country, while `getTimezonesForCountry` returns an array of timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` returns a single country, while `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of countries.

DONE.
