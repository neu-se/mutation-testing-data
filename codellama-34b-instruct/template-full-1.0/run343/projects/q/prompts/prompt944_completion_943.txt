  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with the value immediately, without waiting for the execution of the setTimeout function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would reject with the value immediately, without waiting for the execution of the setTimeout function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would notify with the value immediately, without waiting for the execution of the setTimeout function.

DONE.
