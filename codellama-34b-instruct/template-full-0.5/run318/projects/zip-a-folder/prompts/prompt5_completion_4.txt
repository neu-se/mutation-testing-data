  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is falsy, and if it is, it returns `targetFilePath`. However, this new code fragment would return `targetFilePath` if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is truthy, which is the opposite behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is falsy, and if it is, it returns `targetFilePath`. However, this new code fragment would return `targetFilePath` if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is truthy, which is the opposite behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && targetFilePath
