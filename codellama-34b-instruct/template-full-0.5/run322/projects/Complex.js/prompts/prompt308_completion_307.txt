  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a value that is twice the value of `b`, while the modified code fragment would return a value that is twice the value of `b` plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a value that is twice the value of `b`, while the modified code fragment would return a value that is twice the value of `b` minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a value that is twice the value of `b`, while the modified code fragment would return a value that is four times the value of `b`.

DONE.
