  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with the dot notation. 
``` javascript
inspected.state === 'pending' ||
        inspected.state === 'rejected'
```
This would result in different behavior because the dot notation creates a new property on the `inspected` object, rather than mutating the existing property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with an arrow function expression. 
``` javascript
inspected => {
           if (inspected.state === 'pending' ||
           inspected.state === 'rejected') {
            return deferred
          } else {
            return promise;
          }
        };
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function expression creates a new function that returns `deferred`, whereas the original code returns `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with a logical expression 
```javascript
 inspected.state === 'pending' &&
    inspected.state === 'rejected'
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical expression creates
