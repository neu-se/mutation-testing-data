  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset <= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of the `<` operator, which would cause the `index` to be incremented even if it is equal to `offset`, resulting in a different final value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the `index` to be incremented if `priority` is true, regardless of whether `offset` is less than `index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of the `||` operator, which would cause the `index` to be incremented if `p
