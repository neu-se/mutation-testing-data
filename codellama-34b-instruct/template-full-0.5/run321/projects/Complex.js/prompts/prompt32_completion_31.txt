  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== 0` would evaluate to `true` for any non-zero value of `a`, whereas `a === 0` would only evaluate to `true` for the specific value of `a` being `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a > 0` would evaluate to `true` for any positive value of `a`, whereas `a === 0` would only evaluate to `true` for the specific value of `a` being `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a < 0` would evaluate to `true` for any negative value of `a`, whereas `a === 0` would only evaluate to `true` for the specific value of `a` being `0`.

DONE.
