  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for `timeout`, but `undefined` is not. If `timeout` is `null`, the promise will be rejected with an error message indicating that a timeout value is required.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value for `timeout`, but `undefined` is not. If `timeout` is `0`, the promise will be rejected with an error message indicating that a timeout value is required.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because negative values for `timeout` are not allowed. If `timeout` is negative, the promise will be rejected with an error message indicating that a non-negative timeout value is required.

DONE.
