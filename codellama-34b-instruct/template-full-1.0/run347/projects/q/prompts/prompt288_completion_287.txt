  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
promise.all([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.all([])` is a resolved promise, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
promise.all(["Hello", "World!"])
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.all(["Hello", "World!"])` is a resolved promise with an array of resolved promises, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with an error message.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(new Error("Error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject(new Error("Error message"))` is a rejected promise with an error message, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with no error message.
