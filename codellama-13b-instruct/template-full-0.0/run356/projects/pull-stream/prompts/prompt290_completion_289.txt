  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used to concatenate the `field` variable with the number `1`, which would result in a different output than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used to get the length of the `field` variable, which would result in a different output than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method is used to convert the `field` variable to uppercase, which would result in a different output than the original code.

DONE.
