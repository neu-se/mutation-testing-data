  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor !== Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the constructor of the current object is not the Complex constructor, which is not the same as checking if the current object is not an instance of Complex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.name !== 'Complex'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the name of the constructor of the current object is not 'Complex', which is not the same as checking if the current object is not an instance of Complex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(this) !== Complex.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the prototype of the current object is not the Complex prototype, which is not the same as checking if the current object is not an instance of Complex.

DONE.
