  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause issues if the function expects a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a valid argument value, but it would cause the function to fail if it expects a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref, []
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is a valid argument value, but it would cause the function to fail if it expects a non-empty array.

DONE.
