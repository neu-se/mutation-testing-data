  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `nodeArgs` except the first one, whereas the original code fragment `nodeArgs` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat(null)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `nodeArgs` followed by `null`, whereas the original code fragment `nodeArgs` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove and return the last element of `nodeArgs`, whereas the original code fragment `nodeArgs` would return the original array.

DONE.
