  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` if `end` is `false`, regardless of the value of `acc`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? acc : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `acc` if `end` is `true`, regardless of the value of `acc`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? acc : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `acc` if `end` is `false`, regardless of the value of `acc`.

DONE.
