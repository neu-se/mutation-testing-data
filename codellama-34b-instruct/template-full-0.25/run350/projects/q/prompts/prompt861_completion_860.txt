  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `timeout` is `undefined`, while this code fragment checks whether it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `timeout` is `undefined`, while this code fragment checks whether it is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `timeout` is `undefined`, while this code fragment checks whether it is `0`.

DONE.
