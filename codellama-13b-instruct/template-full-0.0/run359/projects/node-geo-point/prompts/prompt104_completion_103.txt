  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down. This could cause the calculated tile coordinates to be off by one, resulting in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.round` function rounds to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down. This could cause the calculated tile coordinates to be off by one, resulting in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.trunc` function rounds towards zero, while `Math.floor` rounds down. This could cause the calculated tile coordinates to be off by one, resulting in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
