  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a function that returns a promise, but `none` is not a valid function and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a function that returns a promise, but `null` is not a valid function and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a function that returns a promise, but `undefined` is not a valid function and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
