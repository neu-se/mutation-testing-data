 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `getCountry` would be a number (1) instead of a string (countryId). The `data.countries` object might not have a property with the key '1', causing the function to return null or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'randomString'
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `getCountry` would be a hardcoded string ('randomString') instead of a variable (countryId). This would cause the function to return null or an error since `data.countries` is unlikely to have a property with the key 'randomString'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `getCountry` would be a random number generated by `Math.random()` instead of a variable (countryId). This would cause the function
