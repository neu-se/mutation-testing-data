  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callback functions is different, which could cause unintended consequences if the callbacks rely on each other's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra callback function is added to the end of the list, which could cause unintended consequences if the callbacks rely on each other's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback is missing, which could cause unintended consequences if the code relies on the `progressed` callback being executed.

DONE.
