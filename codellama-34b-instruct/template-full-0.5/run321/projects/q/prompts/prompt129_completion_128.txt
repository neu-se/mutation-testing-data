  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an undefined value onto the `keys` array, which would likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the `keys` array, which would likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key + " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a string with a space character onto the `keys` array, which would likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

DONE.
