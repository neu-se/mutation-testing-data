  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(void 0, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify(void 0, args)` would always return a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`, instead of returning a promise that is resolved with the value of `callback` if `callback` is not a function or returning a promise that is rejected with an error if `callback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify(this, args)` would always return a promise that is resolved with the value of `this` instead of returning a promise that is resolved with the value of `callback` if `callback` is not a function or returning a promise that is rejected with an error if `callback` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(args[0], args.slice(
