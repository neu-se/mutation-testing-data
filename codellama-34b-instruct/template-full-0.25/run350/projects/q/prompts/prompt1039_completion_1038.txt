  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` variable would be initialized with a truthy value, which would cause the `get` method to always throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` variable would be initialized with a falsy value, which would cause the `get` method to always return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` variable would be initialized with a null value, which would cause the `get` method to always return a rejected promise with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
