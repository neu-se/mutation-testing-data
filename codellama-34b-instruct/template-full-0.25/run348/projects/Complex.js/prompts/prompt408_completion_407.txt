  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-temp
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would cause the result of the `atan2` function to be negated, which would change the angle of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the result of the `atan2` function to be increased by 1, which would change the angle of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the result of the `atan2` function to be doubled, which would change the angle of the complex number.

DONE.
