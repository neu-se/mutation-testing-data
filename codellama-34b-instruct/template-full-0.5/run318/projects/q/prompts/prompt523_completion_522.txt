  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch" + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator `+` would cause the code to return a string that is not a function, which would lead to a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch" * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` would cause the code to return a number that is not a function, which would lead to a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch" - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator `-` would cause the code to return a number that is not a function, which would lead to a runtime error.

DONE.
