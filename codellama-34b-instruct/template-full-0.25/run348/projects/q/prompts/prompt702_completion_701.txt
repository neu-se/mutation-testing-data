  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially change the output of the function.

DONE.
