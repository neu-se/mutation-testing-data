  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a new op into the delta, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the other op into the delta, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null value into the delta, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
