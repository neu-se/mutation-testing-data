  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the comparison, causing the `allow` variable to be set to `true` when the original code would have set it to `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a weak comparison instead of a strong comparison, which could cause the `allow` variable to be set to `true` when the original code would have set it to `false`, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the comparison, causing the `allow` variable to be set to `true` when the original code would have set it to `false`, or vice versa.

DONE.
