  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise, while `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Different error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Different error message'), { cause: new Error('Another error message') })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message and a different cause.

DONE.
