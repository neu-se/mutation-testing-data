  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment resolves it with the return value of `_fulfilled(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment resolves it with the return value of `_fulfilled(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error object, whereas the original code fragment resolves it with the return value of `_fulfilled(value)`.

DONE.
