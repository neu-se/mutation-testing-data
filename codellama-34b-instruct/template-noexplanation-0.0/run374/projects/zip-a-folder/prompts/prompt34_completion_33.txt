  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it resolves the promise instead of rejecting it. This could cause the promise to be fulfilled even if there is an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', console.log
```
This code fragment logs the error to the console instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause the promise to be fulfilled even if there is an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', throw
```
This code fragment throws an error instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause the promise to be rejected, but it could also cause the program to crash if the error is not handled properly.

DONE.
