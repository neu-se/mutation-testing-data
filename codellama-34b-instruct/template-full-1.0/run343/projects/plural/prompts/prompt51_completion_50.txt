  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce an incorrect plural form for words ending in "o". For example, "photo" would become "photosis" instead of "photos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce an incorrect plural form for words ending in "o". For example, "photo" would become "photoi" instead of "photos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce an incorrect plural form for words ending in "o". For example, "photo" would become "photous" instead of "photos".

DONE.
