  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` variable would always be truthy, even if it was not explicitly set to a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` variable would be truthy only if it was explicitly set to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` variable would be truthy only if it was not defined.

DONE.
