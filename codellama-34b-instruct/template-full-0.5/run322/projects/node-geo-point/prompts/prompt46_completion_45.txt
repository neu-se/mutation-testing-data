  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(φ2)` is a different function than `deg2rad(φ2)` and would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(φ2)` is a different function than `deg2rad(φ2)` and would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(φ2)` is a different function than `deg2rad(φ2)` and would produce a different output.

DONE.
