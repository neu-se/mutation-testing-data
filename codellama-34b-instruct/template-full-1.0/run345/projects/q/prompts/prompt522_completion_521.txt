  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"new exception"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the exception object that is being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value that is being rejected, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value that is being rejected, which could affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
