  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1, while this replacement checks if the string has a length greater than 0. This means that the replacement would allow strings with a length of 1 to pass the check, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.charAt(0) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the string ends with a '/', while this replacement also checks if the first character of the string is a '/'. This means that the replacement would allow strings that end with a '/' but do not start with a '/' to pass the check, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith
