  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolved value of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolved value of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolved value of the argument.

DONE.
