  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex matches a different set of words, specifically those that end in a consonant followed by "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex is case-sensitive, so it would not match words that end in "O" but not in "o".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex matches a different set of words, specifically those that end in a vowel followed by "o".

DONE.
