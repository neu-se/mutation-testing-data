  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but this replacement code fragment does not use the `deg2rad` function, which could cause the calculation to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point1.longitude) - rad2deg(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the longitude values to degrees, but this replacement code fragment does not use the `rad2deg` function, which could cause the calculation to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude - point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the
