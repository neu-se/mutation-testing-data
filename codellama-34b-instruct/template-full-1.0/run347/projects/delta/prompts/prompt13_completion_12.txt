  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
((attributes)['length'] > 0) ? attributes : undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the attributes object using bracket notation instead of the Object.keys method, which could produce different results if the attributes object has numeric keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Object.keys(attributes).length) { ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the attributes object using Object.keys.length instead of Object.keys. This could produce different results if the attributes object has numeric keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).forEach((key) => { ... });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the attributes object using Array.forEach instead of Object.keys. This could produce different results if the attributes object has numeric keys.

DONE.
