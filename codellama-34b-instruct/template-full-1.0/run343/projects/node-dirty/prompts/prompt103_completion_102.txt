  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the value of the `val` property instead of the `key` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be trying to delete the `undefined` key instead of the actual key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be deleting the key multiplied by 2 instead of the actual key.

DONE.
