  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by a different amount than the `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(thisIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by the same amount as the `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by the same amount as the `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
