  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.reverse()` would reverse the array in-place, while the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return a new array with the elements in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice()` would create a shallow copy of the array, while `props.reverse()` would reverse the array in-place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice()` would create a shallow copy of the array, `props.reverse()` would reverse the array in-place, and `props.join('')` would join the elements of the array into a string.

DONE.
