 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]y$|qu$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression checks for words ending in 'quy', but the modified one does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'i' flag makes the regular expression case-insensitive, which changes the behavior of the original regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]y$|[^qu]y$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified regular expression checks for words ending in 'y' but not preceded by 'qu', which is different from the original regular expression.

DONE.
