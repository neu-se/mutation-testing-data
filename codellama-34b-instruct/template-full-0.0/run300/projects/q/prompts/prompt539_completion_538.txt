  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(array).all(<PLACEHOLDER>).then(function (array) {
    return fulfilled.apply(void 0, array);
}, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method is called on `Q(array)` instead of `array` directly, which would cause the `all` method to be called on a promise instead of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(array).all(<PLACEHOLDER>).then(function (array) {
    return fulfilled.apply(void 0, array);
}, rejected);

This would result in different behavior because the `all` method is called on `Q(array)` instead of `array` directly, which would cause the `all` method to be called on a promise instead of an array.
