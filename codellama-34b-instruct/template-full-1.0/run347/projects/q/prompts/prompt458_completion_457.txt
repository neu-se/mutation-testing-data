  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(reason)` always resolves the promise, whereas the original code fragment `promise` could potentially reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(reason)` always rejects the promise, whereas the original code fragment `promise` could potentially resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race([reason])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race([reason])` always resolves the promise with the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment `promise` could potentially reject the promise if the `reason` is not a valid promise.

DONE.
