  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(point.x, point.y, 0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the lat/lon coordinates of the destination point instead of the starting point, which would cause the calculations for distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(coordinate, point.longitude - coordinate.longitude, point.latitude - coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the difference in longitude and latitude between the destination point and the starting point instead of the destination point's lat/lon coordinates, which would cause the calculations for distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(coordinate, point.longitude - coordinate.longitude, point.latitude - coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use
