  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the context of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound context, whereas `apply` and `call` invoke the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, whereas `apply` and `call` invoke the function.

DONE.
