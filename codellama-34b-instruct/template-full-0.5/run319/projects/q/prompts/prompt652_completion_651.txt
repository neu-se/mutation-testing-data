  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `1`, which would include the `name` argument in the slice, whereas the original code fragment excluded the `name` argument by starting the slice at index `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `0`, which would include the `name` argument in the slice, whereas the original code fragment excluded the `name` argument by starting the slice at index `2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `3`, which would exclude the `name` argument from the slice, whereas the original code fragment
