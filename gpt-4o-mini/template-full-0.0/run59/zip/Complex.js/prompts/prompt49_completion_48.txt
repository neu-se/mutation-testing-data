Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of `Number.isFinite`, causing the condition to evaluate to `true` for finite numbers and `false` for non-finite numbers, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is `NaN` instead of checking if it is finite, leading to incorrect handling of valid finite numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `abs` property is undefined rather than checking the finiteness of the value, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the validity of the input.

DONE.
