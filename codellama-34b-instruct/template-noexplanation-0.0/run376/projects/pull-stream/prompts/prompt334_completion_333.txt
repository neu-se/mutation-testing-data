  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to always be called with `end` set to `false`, even if the original `end` value was `true`. This will cause the stream to continue reading data even after it has reached the end, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to always be called with `end` set to `true`, even if the original `end` value was `false`. This will cause the stream to stop reading data as soon as it reaches the end, which may cause data to be lost.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ^ true
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to always be called with `end` set to the opposite of its original value. This will cause the stream to toggle between reading and not reading data, which may cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
