  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the array instead of adding a new one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `stack` array instead of adding a single element to the end of `desiredLines`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.splice(0, 0, stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `stack` array into the beginning of `desiredLines` instead of adding it to the end.

DONE.
