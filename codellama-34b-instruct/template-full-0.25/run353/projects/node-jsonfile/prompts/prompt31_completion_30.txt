  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive `null` as the second argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive `undefined` as the second argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive an empty object as the second argument, which would cause it to return an empty string.

DONE.
