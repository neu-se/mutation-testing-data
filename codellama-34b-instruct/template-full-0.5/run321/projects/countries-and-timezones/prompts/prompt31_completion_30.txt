  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 61)
```
This would result in different behavior because the divisor is changed from 60 to 61, which would result in a different number of hours.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the divisor is changed from 60 to 61, which would result in a different number of hours.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the divisor is changed from 60 to 61, which would result in a different number of hours.

DONE.
