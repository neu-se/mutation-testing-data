  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.bind(this, attr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` expects an array as its first argument, but `attr` is an object, so `Object.keys.bind(this, attr)` would return a function that expects an array as its first argument, which would result in an error when trying to apply it to an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.call({}, attr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys.call({}, attr)` would return the keys of the object `{}`, which is always an empty array, while `Object.keys` applied to an object would return an array of all its own property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.apply(this, attr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys.apply(this, attr)` would return the keys of the object `this`, which is
