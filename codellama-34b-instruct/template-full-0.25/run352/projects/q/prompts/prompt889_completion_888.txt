  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with the elements from a given array, starting from a specified position. In this case, it would return a new array with the elements from `arguments` starting from the third position (index 2), which would exclude the first two arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the elements from `arguments` starting from the fourth position (index 3), which would exclude the first three arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the elements from `arguments` starting from the fifth position (index 4), which would exclude the first four arguments passed to the
