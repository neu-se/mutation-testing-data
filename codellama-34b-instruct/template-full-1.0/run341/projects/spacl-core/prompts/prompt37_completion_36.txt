  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.slice(1)` would return the array of characters from the first character to the end of the string, instead of the array of characters excluding the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.substring(1)` would return the substring starting from the first character, instead of the array of characters excluding the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  [...spread operator]
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator would return an array of characters from the first character to the end of the string, instead of the array of characters excluding the first character.

DONE.
