  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because "isFinite" and "isNaN" return different values for NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because "isInfinite" and "isNaN" return different values for Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(this['im']) && Math.abs(this['im']) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part is not a number, and if so, if the absolute value is greater than 0.

DONE.
