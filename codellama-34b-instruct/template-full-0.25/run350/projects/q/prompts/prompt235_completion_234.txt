  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments as an array instead of individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a shallow copy of the arguments array instead of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenated version of the arguments array instead of the original array.

DONE.
