  Answer:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign is flipped, which would cause the complex exponent function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine function is used instead of the sine function, which would cause the complex exponent function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the tangent function is used instead of the sine function, which would cause the complex exponent function to behave differently.

DONE.
