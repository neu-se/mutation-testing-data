 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Error: Corrupted row at the end of the db'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object constructor is not being called, which could affect how the error is handled or logged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Corrupted row at the end of a different db: ' + this.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message now includes the path of the database, which could make it harder to determine whether the error is related to the specific buffer content or the database file itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db').name = 'DatabaseError'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the name property of the error object, which could affect how the error is caught and handled in other parts of the code that rely on the error name to determine the type of error that occurred.

DONE.
