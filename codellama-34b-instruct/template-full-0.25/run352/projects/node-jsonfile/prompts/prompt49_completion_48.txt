  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `stringify` function would throw an error when trying to parse `null` as an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value. The `stringify` function would throw an error when trying to parse `undefined` as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object. The `stringify` function would not throw an error when trying to parse an empty object, but it would produce a different output than the original code fragment.

DONE.
