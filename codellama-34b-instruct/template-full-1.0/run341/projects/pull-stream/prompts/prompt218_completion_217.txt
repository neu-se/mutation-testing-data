  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `err`, and therefore would not trigger the same conditional logic in the following code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `cb`, and therefore would not trigger the same conditional logic in the following code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `err`, and therefore would not trigger the same conditional logic in the following code.

DONE.
