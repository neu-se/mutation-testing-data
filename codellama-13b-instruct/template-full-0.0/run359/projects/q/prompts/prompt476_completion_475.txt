  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, which would prevent the promise from being considered unhandled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, which could cause the promise to be considered unhandled even if it was handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, which could cause the promise to be considered unhandled even if it was handled.

DONE.
