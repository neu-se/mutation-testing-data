  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` computes `e^x`, while `Math.cos` computes the cosine of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` computes the sine of `x`, while `Math.cos` computes the cosine of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` computes the tangent of `x`, while `Math.cos` computes the cosine of `x`.

DONE.
