  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while this code calls it with `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while this code calls it with `_value` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function directly, while this code calls it through the `abortCb` function.

DONE.
