  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method would be called on the write stream, which would cause it to stop writing and close the stream, whereas the original code fragment called `destroy()` which would destroy the stream and release any resources associated with it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write()` method would be called on the write stream with an empty string, which would cause it to write an empty string to the stream, whereas the original code fragment called `destroy()` which would destroy the stream and release any resources associated with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork()` method would be called on the write stream, which would cause it to stop writing and wait for the `uncork()` method to be called, whereas the original code fragment
