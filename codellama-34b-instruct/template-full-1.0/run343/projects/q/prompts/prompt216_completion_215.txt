  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which would have a cascading effect on the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the argument `value` instead of the promise itself, which would violate the contract of the `Q` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the argument `value` instead of the promise itself, which would violate the contract of the `Q` function.

DONE.
