  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at the second element of the `arguments` array instead of the first, which may cause the function to skip over the first argument and not apply it to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at the last element of the `arguments` array instead of the first, which may cause the function to apply the last argument to the `read` function instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This change will cause the loop to start at a random element of the `arguments` array, which may cause the function to apply a random argument to the `read` function instead of the first.

DONE.
