  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.host
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `linkurl` and `pageurl` variables instead of the `linkurl` and `pageurl` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `!=` operator instead of the `==` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.includes(pageurl.host)
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `includes()` method instead of the `==` operator.

DONE.
