  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(promises)` would not wait for all promises to be fulfilled, but instead would return a promise for a copy of the input array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(promises)` would not wait for all promises to be fulfilled, but instead would return a rejected promise with the input array as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.then(Q.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wait for all promises to be fulfilled, but would then return a promise for an array of resolved values, which is not the expected behavior based on the context.

DONE.
