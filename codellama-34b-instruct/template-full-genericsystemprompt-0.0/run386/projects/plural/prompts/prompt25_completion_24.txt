  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it would return a different substring of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `substr`, and it would return a different substring of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the input word starting from the second character, instead of starting from the first character.

DONE.
