  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a `null` literal, while the replaced code fragment is a string containing the word "null".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a `null` literal, while the replaced code fragment is an `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a `null` literal, while the replaced code fragment is an empty object.

DONE.
