  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `any`, and it would return a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the input array have resolved, rather than when any of them have resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a different method than `any`, and it would return a promise that resolves when none of the promises in the input array have resolved, rather than when any of them have resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` is a different method than `any`, and it would return a promise that resolves when some of the promises in the input array have resolved, rather than when any of them have resolved.

DONE.
