  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/[aeiouy]o$/i, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the `o` with `e` if it is preceded by a vowel or the letter `y`. In contrast, the original code fragment would replace `o` with `e` regardless of the preceding character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/^[aeiouy]o$/i, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the `o` with `e` if it is at the beginning of the word and is preceded by a vowel or the letter `y`. In contrast, the original code fragment would replace `o` with `e` regardless of its position in the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/o$
