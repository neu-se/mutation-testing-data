  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt3` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `undefined` instead of an array with the file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt2` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `undefined` instead of an array with the file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt1` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `undefined` instead of an array with the file name and line number.

DONE.
