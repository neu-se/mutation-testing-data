  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called with the wrong `this` context, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` method would be called instead of the `emit` method, which could cause the application to behave differently or produce different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function () {}` expression would be evaluated and returned instead of the `emit` method, which could cause the application to behave differently or produce different output.

DONE.
