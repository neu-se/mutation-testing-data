  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now incremented by 1, which could cause the `read` function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now decremented by 1, which could cause the `read` function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now multiplied by 2, which could cause the `read` function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
