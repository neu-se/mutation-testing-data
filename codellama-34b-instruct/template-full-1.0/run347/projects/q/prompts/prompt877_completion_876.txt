  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last element of the `args` array, potentially causing the `nodeArgs` array to be missing a necessary argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args.length, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an array of length `args.length` with all values set to `0`, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last two elements of the `args` array, potentially causing the `nodeArgs` array to be missing a necessary argument.

It's important to chose options that would create different behavior than the original code, as that is the goal of mutation testing.

DONE.
