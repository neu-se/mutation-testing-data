Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the arguments array from 1 to 0, which means it will include the first argument instead of excluding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the arguments array with an empty array, meaning no arguments will be passed to the invoked method, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1).reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the arguments passed to the invoked method, which could change the outcome if the method relies on the order of its parameters.

DONE.
