 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then(promise => promise.get("head"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `then` method to wrap the `get` method call, which could change the order of execution and affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get.bind(ends.promise)("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `bind` method to create a new function with `ends.promise` as its `this` value, which could cause unexpected behavior if `ends.promise` is changed later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get.call(ends.promise, "head")
