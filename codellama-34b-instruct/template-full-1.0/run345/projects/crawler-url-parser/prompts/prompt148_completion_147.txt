  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the split method is applied to the path property of the link string, but in this replacement, it is applied to the first part of the linkURL parts array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the split method is applied to the path property of the link string, but in this replacement, it is applied to the length of the first part of the linkURL parts array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_parts[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the split method is applied to the path property of the page string, but in this replacement, it is applied to the first part of the pageURL parts array.

DONE.
