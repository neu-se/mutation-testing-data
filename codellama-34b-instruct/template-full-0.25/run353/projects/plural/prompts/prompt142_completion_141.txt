  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block if the first element of the `rule` array is not equal to the `word` variable, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block if the first element of the `rule` array is equal to the `word` variable, which is not the intended behavior.
