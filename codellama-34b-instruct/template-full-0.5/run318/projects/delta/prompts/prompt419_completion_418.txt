  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is not the same as `delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is not the same as `delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'delete' && offset > index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply the `delete` operation if the offset is greater than the index, which would result in different behavior in certain edge cases.

DONE.
