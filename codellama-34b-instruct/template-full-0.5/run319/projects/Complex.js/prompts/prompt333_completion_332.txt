  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-2`, even though it is not equal to `-1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would evaluate to `true` when `b` is not equal to `-1`, even though it is equal to `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -1 && a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-1` and `a` is equal to `1`, even though it is not the case.

DONE.
