 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<GeoPoint>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method now expects a `GeoPoint` object as its argument, instead of `this` (which refers to the current `GeoPoint` instance). This change would cause an error if the method is called without providing a `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => new GeoPoint(0, 0)
