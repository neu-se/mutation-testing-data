  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a non-capturing group, which is not present in the new code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?woman$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches "man" or "woman" case-insensitively, while the new code fragment matches "woman" case-insensitively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?woman$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the case-insensitive flag, while the new code fragment does not.

DONE.
