  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because a non-default parameter is passed to the `parser_exit` function, which would cause the function to throw a different error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional function call is made to `parseFloat`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a object, not a string or array, so `a[i + 1]` would not be a valid expression and would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
