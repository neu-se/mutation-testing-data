  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator to replace the matched pattern with an empty string, while the new code fragment is using the `*` operator to replace the matched pattern with a single space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator to replace the matched pattern with an empty string, while the new code fragment is using the `*` operator to replace the matched pattern with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "$1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator to replace the matched pattern with an empty string, while the new code fragment is
