  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the peekType() method is called on the thisIter object, which is an OpIterator instance. The peekType() method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, which can be either 'insert', 'retain', or 'delete'. In this case, the code is checking if the next operation is a 'delete' operation. If it is replaced with 'insert', the code would be checking if the next operation is an 'insert' operation, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the peekType() method is called on the otherIter object, which is an OpIterator instance. The peekType() method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, which can be either 'insert', 'retain', or 'delete'. In this case
