  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dye', 'dyes'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'dye' and 'dyes' are not the same as 'die' and 'dice', and therefore would not be caught by the current rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'dies' is not the correct plural form of 'die', and therefore would not be caught by the current rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice', 'dying'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'dying' is not the correct plural form of 'dice', and therefore would not be caught by the current rules.

DONE.
