  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This could potentially cause the policy to be evaluated differently, depending on the order of the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This could potentially cause the policy to be evaluated differently, depending on the order of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This could potentially cause the policy to be evaluated differently, depending on the order of the rules.

DONE.
