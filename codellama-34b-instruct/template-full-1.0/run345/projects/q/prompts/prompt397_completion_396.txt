  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is the opposite of `thenResolve`, and will instead reject the returned promise with the specified reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenCancel
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenCancel` is not a standard Promise method, and its behavior would depend on any custom implementation of this method in the specific Promise polyfill or library being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenDelay
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenDelay` is not a standard Promise method, and its behavior would depend on any custom implementation of this method in the specific Promise polyfill or library being used.

DONE.
