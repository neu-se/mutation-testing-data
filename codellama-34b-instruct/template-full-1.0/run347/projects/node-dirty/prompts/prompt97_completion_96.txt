  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `_emit` is not a function and will throw a `TypeError` when called, whereas `emit` is a function and may have a different implementation that is important for the correct functioning of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to a different context, and may have a different implementation that is important for the correct functioning of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async () => this.emit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `async () => this.emit()` creates a new asynchronous function that wraps the call to `emit()`, and may have a different implementation that is important for the correct functioning of the code.

DONE.
