Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'nonexistentFile.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always attempt to read a file that does not exist, leading to an error that will be thrown if `shouldThrow` is true, whereas the original code reads the file specified by the `file` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'extra.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the file path by appending 'extra.txt', which may lead to reading a different file than intended, potentially causing unexpected results or errors if that file does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `fs.readFile` will likely cause an error, as the function expects a valid file path, whereas the original code correctly uses the `file` variable to specify the file to read.

DONE.
