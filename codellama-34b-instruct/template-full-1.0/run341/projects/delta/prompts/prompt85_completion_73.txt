  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp["attributes"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is being accessed as an array index instead of an object property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` property does not exist and would yield a different result than the intended `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes["prop"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is being accessed on the `lastOp` object instead of the `newOp` object, and the `prop` property does not exist on the `attributes` object.

DONE.
