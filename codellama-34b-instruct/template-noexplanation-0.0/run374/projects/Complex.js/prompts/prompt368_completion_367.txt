  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to always return `1`, which will make the `coth` function return `0` for all inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to always return `2`, which will make the `coth` function return `0.5` for all inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to always return `2a`, which will make the `coth` function return `a / (a + b)` for all inputs.

DONE.
