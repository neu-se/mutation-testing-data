  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])`, which would pass the arguments starting from the second argument, whereas the new code would pass the arguments starting from the first argument.
