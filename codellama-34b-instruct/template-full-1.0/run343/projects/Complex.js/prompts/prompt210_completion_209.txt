  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `a`, while the mutated code fragment returns `a + 1`. This small change in the return value could have a significant impact on the behavior of the program, especially if the return value is used in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `a`, while the mutated code fragment returns `a - 1`. This small change in the return value could have a significant impact on the behavior of the program, especially if the return value is used in other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `a`, while the mutated code fragment returns `a * 2`. This small change in the return value could have a significant
