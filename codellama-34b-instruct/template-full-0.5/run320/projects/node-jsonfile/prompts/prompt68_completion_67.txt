  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which will replace all occurrences of the byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which will make the regular expression case-insensitive, so it will match both the BOM and its uppercase version (`\uFEFF`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[\uFEFF\u2060]/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is changed to match either the BOM or the zero-width non-breaking space (ZWNBSP), which has the same effect as the original code but with a different regular expression.

DONE.
