  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to access the `customWriteStream` property of the `zipAFolderOptions` object. This operator allows the code to continue executing even if `zipAFolderOptions` is null or undefined, which can help prevent errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy before accessing the `customWriteStream` property. This can help prevent errors if `zipAFolderOptions` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || output
```
This code fragment uses the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to access the `customWriteStream` property
