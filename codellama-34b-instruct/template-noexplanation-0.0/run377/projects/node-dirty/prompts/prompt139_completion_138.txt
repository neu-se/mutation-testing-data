  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 && err != null
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses a different operator (`===`) and a different variable (`cbs.length`) to check if the `cbs` array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length && err != null
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses a different operator (`!`) to check if the `cbs` array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 && err != null
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses a different operator (`===`) and a different variable (`cbs.length`) to check if the `cbs` array is empty.

DONE.
