  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with a "#" character, while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with a "#" character and ends with a "$" character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that contains a "#" character, while the new code fragment matches any string that contains a "#" character and ends with a "$" character, and the "g" flag at the end of the regular expression makes it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that contains a "#" character, while the new code fragment matches any string that contains a "#" character and ends with a "$" character, and the "i" flag
