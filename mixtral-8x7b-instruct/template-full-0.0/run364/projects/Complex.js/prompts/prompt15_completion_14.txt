 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 instead of the cos(x) - 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square of the input instead of the correct cos(x) - 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of the correct cos(x) - 1.

DONE.
