  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the code to enter the `else` block even if the `src` is a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.call(this, src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isGlob` function with the `this` context set to the current object, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.bind(this)(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the current object and calls the `isGlob` function with the `src` argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
