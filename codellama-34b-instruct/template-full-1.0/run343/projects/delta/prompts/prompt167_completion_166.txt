  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
    <PLACEHOLDER>(thisIter.next());
```
This change would crash the code because there is no next() method defined for the <PLACEHOLDER> variable. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    <PLACEHOLDER>(otherIter.next());
```
This change would crash the code because there is no next() method defined for the <PLACEHOLDER> variable. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    <PLACEHOLDER>(otherIter.next());
```
This change would change the behavior of the code by modifying other's iteration to begin with the value referenced by thisIter. It is unclear what effect this might have.  

DONE.
