  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property would be checked against the string "rejected", instead of the string "pending" or "rejected". If the promise is rejected, the `valueOf` method would return the promise itself, instead of the `inspected.value` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property would be checked against the string "fulfilled", instead of the string "pending" or "rejected". If the promise is fulfilled, the `valueOf` method would return the `inspected.value` property, instead of the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property would be checked
