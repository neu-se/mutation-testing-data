  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, "utf8"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `options` object to determine the encoding, but this replacement uses a hardcoded encoding value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `options` object to determine the encoding, but this replacement uses the `encoding` property of the `options` object, which may have a different value than the hardcoded encoding value in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options["encoding"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `options` object to determine the encoding, but this replacement uses the `encoding` property of the `options` object, which may have a different value than the hardcoded encoding value in the original code.

DONE.
