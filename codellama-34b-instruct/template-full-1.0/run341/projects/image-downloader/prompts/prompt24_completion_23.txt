  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some/other/directory"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now always resolve to the same directory, regardless of the value of the `options.dest` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now resolve to the parent directory of the value passed in `options.dest`, rather than the value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now resolve to the basename of the value passed in `options.dest`, rather than the value itself.

DONE.
