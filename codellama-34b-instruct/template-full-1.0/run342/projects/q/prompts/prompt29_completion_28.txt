  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push()
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the `laterQueue` would grow indefinitely without being flushed, leading to a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in the `laterQueue` being emptied, without any tasks being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length % 2
```
This would result in the `laterQueue` being alternately grown and shrunk, without any tasks being executed.

DONE.
