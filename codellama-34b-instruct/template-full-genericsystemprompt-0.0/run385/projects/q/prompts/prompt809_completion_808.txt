  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is falsy or if `callback.apply` is not a function, while this replacement only checks if `callback.apply` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is falsy or if `callback.apply` is not a function, while this replacement only checks if `callback.apply` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is falsy or if `callback.apply` is not a function, while this replacement only checks if `callback.apply` is an object.

DONE.
