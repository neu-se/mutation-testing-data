  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an options object, but `options.encoding` is a string representing the encoding of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an options object, but `null` is not an options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an options object, but `undefined` is not an options object.

DONE.
