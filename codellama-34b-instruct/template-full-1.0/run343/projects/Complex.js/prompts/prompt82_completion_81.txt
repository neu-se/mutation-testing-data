  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for 'j' or 'J' would not be considered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for 'i' or 'I' would only be for the first letter, not the entire word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'I' || c === '|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for 'i' or 'I' would consider an additional character, which would cause the code to evaluate to true.

DONE.
