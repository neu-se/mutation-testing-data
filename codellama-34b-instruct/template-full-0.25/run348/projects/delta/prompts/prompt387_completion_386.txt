  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a different value, potentially causing issues in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a different value, potentially causing issues in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a different value, potentially causing issues in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

DONE.
