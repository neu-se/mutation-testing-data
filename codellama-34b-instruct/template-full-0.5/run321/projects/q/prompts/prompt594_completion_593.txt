  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `self` refers to the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have any properties or methods, whereas `self` refers to the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have any properties or methods, whereas `self` refers to the `Promise` object.

DONE.
