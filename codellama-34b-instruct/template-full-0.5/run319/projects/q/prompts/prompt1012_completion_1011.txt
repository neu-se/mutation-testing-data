  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.reject` with no arguments, while this replacement uses `deferred.reject` with an `error` argument. This would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which could result in different behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.reject` with no arguments, while this replacement uses `deferred.resolve` with a `value` argument. This would cause the promise to be resolved with a value, which could result in different behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.reject` with no arguments, while this replacement uses `deferred
