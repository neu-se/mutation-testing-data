  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in an exception being thrown, regardless of whether the value of `threw` is true or false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `threw`, which would cause the `deferred.notify` method to always be called, regardless of whether `threw` is true or false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `threw` and then negate the result, which would always result in `true`, regardless of whether `threw` is true or false.

DONE.
