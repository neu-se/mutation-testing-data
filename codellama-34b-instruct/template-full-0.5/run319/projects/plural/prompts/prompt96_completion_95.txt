  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'b') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'a' + 'b') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'a' + 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different.

DONE.
