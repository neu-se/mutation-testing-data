  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a promise, while `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the deferred object, while `Q.defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject` returns a function that can be used to reject the promise, while `Q.defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
