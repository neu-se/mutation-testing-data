Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
middleware.applyBeforeValidation === beforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the middleware to be skipped when its `applyBeforeValidation` property matches the `beforeValidation` parameter, instead of when they don't match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!middleware.applyBeforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `beforeValidation` parameter and only checks if the middleware's `applyBeforeValidation` property is falsy, potentially causing some middlewares to be skipped unnecessarily.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
beforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it always skips the middleware when `beforeValidation` is true, regardless of the middleware's `applyBeforeValidation` property, potentially causing some middlewares to be skipped even if they are intended to run before validation.

DONE.
