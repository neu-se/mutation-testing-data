 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if the absolute value of `b` is 0, while this condition checks if `b` is greater than 0, which would allow negative values and thus change the outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the logarithm of `a` instead of considering the absolute value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the strict inequality would allow non-zero values, including negative values, which would change the outcome of the function.

DONE.
