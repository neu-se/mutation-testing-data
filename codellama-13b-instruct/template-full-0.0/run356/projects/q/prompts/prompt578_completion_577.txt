  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "send" operator would cause the generator to continue executing, whereas the "next" operator would cause it to pause and wait for the next value to be yielded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "throw" operator would cause the generator to throw an exception, whereas the "next" operator would cause it to pause and wait for the next value to be yielded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "return" operator would cause the generator to return a value, whereas the "next" operator would cause it to pause and wait for the next value to be yielded.

DONE.
