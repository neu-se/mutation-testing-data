  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error('Something went wrong')` would throw an error, whereas `reject` would reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would end the output stream, whereas `reject` would reject the promise.

DONE.
