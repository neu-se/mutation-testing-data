  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls `cb` with two arguments, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the function is not designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(err)` calls `cb` with one argument, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the function is not designed to handle a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(null, null)` calls `cb` with two arguments, both of which are `null
