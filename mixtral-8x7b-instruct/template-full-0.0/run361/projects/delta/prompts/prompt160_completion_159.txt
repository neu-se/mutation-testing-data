 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `thisIter` iterator without pushing the current operation to the `delta` object. This could lead to missing operations in the resulting `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `null` value to the `delta` object, which is not an expected value for the `Delta` class. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing the resulting `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator instead of pushing the current operation to the `delta` object. This could lead to missing operations in the resulting `Delta` object or incorrectly processed operations.

DONE.
