  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "Promise.reject()". This would result in the same error being thrown, but it would be a different function that threw it, which might provide some additional information about the cause of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "undefined". This would cause the if statement to throw an error, because undefined is not a function and cannot be called. This would provide additional information about the cause of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "false". This would cause the if statement to throw an error, because false is a falsy value and cannot be used as a function. This would provide additional information about the cause of the error.

DONE.
