  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a number, but this replacement would assign an object instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === newOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was assigning a value, but this replacement would perform a comparison instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.shift(newOp, otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a number, but this replacement would apply a different operation instead.

DONE.
