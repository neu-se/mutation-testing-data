  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object, but `null` is not a valid `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object with non-zero coordinates, but `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` has zero coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.longitude, this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a `GeoPoint` object with different coordinates than the current object, but `new GeoPoint(this.longitude, this.latitude)` has the same coordinates as the current object.

DONE.
