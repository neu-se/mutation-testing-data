  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will cause the promise to reject and trigger the promise's failure callback, while `deferred.resolve` will cause the promise to resolve and trigger the promise's success callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly reject the promise with the given error, without going through the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a `null` value, instead of the expected error value.

DONE.
