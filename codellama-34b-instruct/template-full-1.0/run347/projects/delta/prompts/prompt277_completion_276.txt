  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition and consider the case where the iterator's next operation is not a deletion, rather than a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition and consider the case where the iterator's next operation is not an insertion, rather than a deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek !== 'replace'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition and consider the case where the iterator's next operation is not a replacement, rather than a deletion.

DONE.
