  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because 1 is a number, but the original code fragment expected an Error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not an instance of Error, but the original code fragment expected an Error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because {} is an empty object, but the original code fragment expected an Error object with a message and stack trace.

DONE.
