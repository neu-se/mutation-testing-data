  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments.length` check would pass even if only one argument is provided, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments.length` check would fail if more than two arguments are provided, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments.length` check would pass only if three arguments are provided, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
