  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```resolvedPromise !== deferred.promise```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the resolved promise is not the same as the deferred promise, which would always be true, and instantaneously reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```undefined```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the resolved promise to undefined, and the promise would be forever pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```deferred.promise.notify(undushed.reject)```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the notify method of the deferred promise, with the reject method of undushed as the argument, and the promise would be forever pending, but with the added side effect of calling the reject method of undushed.

DONE.
