  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being used instead of `cos`, which would produce a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ + π/2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being applied to a different value, which would produce a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being used in a different way, which would produce a different output for the same input.

DONE.
