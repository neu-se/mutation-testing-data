  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(2)` would consume two ops instead of one, potentially causing the delta to be transformed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would consume an op from the other iter instead of the current iter, potentially causing the delta to be transformed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(0)` would consume zero ops, potentially causing the delta to be transformed incorrectly.

DONE.
