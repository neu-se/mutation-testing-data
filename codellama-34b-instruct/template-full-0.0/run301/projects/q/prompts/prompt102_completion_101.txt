  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `basis` variable to be incremented, which could potentially change the outcome of the `reduce` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `basis` variable to be decremented, which could potentially change the outcome of the `reduce` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `basis` variable to be multiplied by 2, which could potentially change the outcome of the `reduce` function.

DONE.
