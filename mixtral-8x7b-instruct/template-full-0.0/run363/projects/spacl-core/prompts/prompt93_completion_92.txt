 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.from(this.entries()).find(([name, _policy]) => name === policy.name)?.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.from()` to create an array of entries, filters the array to find the entry with the matching policy name, and then attempts to call the `set` method on the value of that entry. This is different from the original code, which directly sets the value in the map using `this.set()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.delete(policy.name) && this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it first deletes the entry with the given policy name (if it exists), and then attempts to set the value in the map using `this.set()`. This is different from the original code, which simply sets the value in the map without deleting any existing entries.
