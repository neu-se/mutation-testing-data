  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, which would remove the last path component from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is "/", which would replace the last path component with a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, which would remove the last path component from the URL.

DONE.
