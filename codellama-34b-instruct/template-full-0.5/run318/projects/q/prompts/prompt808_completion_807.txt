  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the given promise, unchanged, whereas the mutated code fragment returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the given promise, unchanged, whereas the mutated code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Mutated code")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the given promise, unchanged, whereas the mutated code fragment returns a rejected promise with a new error.

DONE.
