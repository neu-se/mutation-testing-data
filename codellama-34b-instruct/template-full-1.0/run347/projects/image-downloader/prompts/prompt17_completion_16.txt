  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string `'1'` to the end of the `decodedBasename`, causing the downloaded image to have a different name than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
upperDecodedBasename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capitalize the first letter of the file name, causing the downloaded image to be saved with a different file name than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the file name to lowercase, causing the downloaded image to be saved with a different file name than expected.

DONE.
