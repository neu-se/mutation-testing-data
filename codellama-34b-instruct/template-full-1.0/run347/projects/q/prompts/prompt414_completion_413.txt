  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function will return `value` if it is not a promise, whereas the original code would return a resolved promise with `value` as the resolution value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function will return `value` if it is not a promise, whereas the original code would return a resolved promise with `value` as the resolution value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function will treat the large number as a promise that is pending, whereas the original code would treat it as a fulfilled promise with that large number as the resolution value.

DONE.
