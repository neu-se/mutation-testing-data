  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()`, which is a different condition than `this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isZero']()`. The original code checks if both `this` and `z` are zero, while the modified code checks if `this` is zero and `z` is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()`, which is a different condition than `this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()`. The original code checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the modified code checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero.
