  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has a property with the given name, but `object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)` would call the function with the `this` context set to the current object, which would cause the function to always return `true`, even if the object does not have the property.
