 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof point !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the type of the point variable and does not consider the 'null' case, which is included in the original isObject function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the point variable is 'null' and does not consider other types of objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.constructor.name !== 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the point variable is an instance of the 'Object' constructor, which is not the same as checking if it is an 'object' type.

DONE.
