  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be different, causing the archive to be created with a different level of compression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be the same as the original code, but the code would still be different, causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.low
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be different, causing the archive to be created with a different level of compression.

DONE.
