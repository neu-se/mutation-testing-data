 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if a path is absolute. This change would cause the function to incorrectly treat the `options.dest` as absolute if it contains any path separators, even if it's not an absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Boolean(options.dest)` checks if `options.dest` is truthy, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if a path is absolute. This change would cause the function to incorrectly treat empty strings or falsy values as valid destinations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(options.dest)
