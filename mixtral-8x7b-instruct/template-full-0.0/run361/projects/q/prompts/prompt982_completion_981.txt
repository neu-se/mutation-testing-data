 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` call is bypassed, and `null` is passed as the resolve function to the Node.js-style callback. This could cause issues if the callback expects a specific function to be passed as the last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is passed as the resolve function to the Node.js-style callback instead of the actual `makeNodeResolver()` function. This could cause issues if the callback expects the `makeNodeResolver()` function to handle resolution and rejection of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method of the current promise is passed as the resolve function to the Node.js-style callback instead of the `makeNodeResolver()` function. This could cause issues if the
