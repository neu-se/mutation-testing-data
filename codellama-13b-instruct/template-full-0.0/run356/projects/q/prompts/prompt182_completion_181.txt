  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackLine` variable is converted to uppercase, which would affect the behavior of the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackLine` variable is converted to lowercase, which would affect the behavior of the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackLine` variable is truncated to 10 characters, which would affect the behavior of the `isInternalFrame` function.

DONE.
