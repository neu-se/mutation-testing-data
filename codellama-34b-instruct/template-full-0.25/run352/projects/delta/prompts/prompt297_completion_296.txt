  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` parameter would be an empty object, which may not match the expected behavior of the `predicate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` parameter would be the attributes of the next two operations, which may not match the expected behavior of the `predicate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` parameter would be the attributes of the next operation, and the `i` parameter would be incremented by 1, which may not match the expected behavior of the `predicate` function.

DONE.
