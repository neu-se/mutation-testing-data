  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` schedules the function to be called repeatedly, whereas `setTimeout` schedules the function to be called once after a specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules the function to be called at the end of the event loop, whereas `setTimeout` schedules the function to be called after a specified delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve().then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve().then` creates a new promise that is resolved asynchronously, whereas `setTimeout` schedules the function to be called after a specified delay.

DONE.
