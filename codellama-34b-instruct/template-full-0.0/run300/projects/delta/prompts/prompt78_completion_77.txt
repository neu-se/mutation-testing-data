  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are numbers, while this code checks if they are both strings. This would cause the code to behave differently if the values of `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are numbers, while this code checks if `newOp.delete` is a number and `lastOp.delete` is a string. This would cause the code to behave differently if the values of `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are not numbers.
