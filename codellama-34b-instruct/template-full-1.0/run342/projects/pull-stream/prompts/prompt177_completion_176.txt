  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` unconditionally returns `abortCb` while `i > array.length` will not return `abortCb` if the array is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` unconditionally returns `abortCb` while `array[i] !== undefined` will not return `abortCb` if the current array element is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` unconditionally returns `abortCb` while `i + 1 < array.length` will not return `abortCb` if there is still at least one element in the array.

DONE.
