  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"line"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the filterStackString function to always return the same value, regardless of the input stack string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ERROR"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the filterStackString function to return "ERROR" for any stack line that is not an internal frame.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"File not found"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the filterStackString function to return "File not found" for any stack line that does not contain a file name.

DONE.
