Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `defer` function instead of creating a new deferred object, which would lead to a failure when trying to call `makeNodeResolver()` on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string "error" to the `defer` function, which is not a valid argument, potentially causing the `defer` function to behave incorrectly and not create a proper deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer({});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object to the `defer` function, which may not be handled correctly by the `makeNodeResolver()` method, leading to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to resolve the promise.

DONE.
