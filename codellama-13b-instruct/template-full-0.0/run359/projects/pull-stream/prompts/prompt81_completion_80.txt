  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the operands are not of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the operand is not an instance of the `Error` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.name === 'Error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of the `err` object is compared to the string `'Error'` instead of using the `==` operator, which would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the `name` property is not set to the string `'Error'`.

DONE.
