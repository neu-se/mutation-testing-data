  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the position of `name` and `nodeArgs` in the array would be reversed, which could cause problems if the function being called expects a specific order for the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["foo", name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being called would receive `"foo"` as the first argument instead of the expected `nodeArgs[0]`. This could cause errors or incorrect results if the function relies on the correct values of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, null, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being called would receive `null` as the second argument instead of the expected `nodeArgs[0]`. This could cause errors or incorrect results if the function relies on the correct values of the arguments.

DONE.
