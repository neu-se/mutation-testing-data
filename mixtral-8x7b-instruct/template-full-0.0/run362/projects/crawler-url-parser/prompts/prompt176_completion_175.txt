 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"http" + url
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends "http" to the URL, which may change the behavior of the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the URL to uppercase, which may affect the comparison and matching of URL components in the `parse` and `gettype` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url.replace(/\s/g, '')
