  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === '+'` would cause the parser to exit when it encounters a plus sign, even if it is part of a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === 'i'` would cause the parser to exit when it encounters the letter "i", even if it is part of a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '('
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === '('` would cause the parser to exit when it encounters an opening parenthesis, even if
