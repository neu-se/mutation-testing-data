Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the minutes, which could lead to an incorrect time representation, especially when the minutes are at the maximum value of 59.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the minutes, which would incorrectly represent the time offset, potentially leading to an erroneous time calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the minutes, which could cause the time representation to be off by one minute, affecting the accuracy of the offset string.

DONE.
