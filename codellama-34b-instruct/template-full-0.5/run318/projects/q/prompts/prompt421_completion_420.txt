This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if an object is a promise-like object, which includes objects that have a `then` method but may not be instances of the `Promise` class. This could cause the `then` method to be called on a non-promise object, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` checks if a promise is in the rejected state, which means that the promise has been resolved with a rejection reason. If the promise
