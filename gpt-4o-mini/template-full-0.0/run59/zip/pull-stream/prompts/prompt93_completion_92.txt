Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback from `null` to `true`, which could lead to the caller interpreting the result as an error instead of a successful operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of the callback from `data` to `undefined`, which means the caller would receive no data instead of the expected data, potentially causing confusion or errors in handling the response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `err` variable as the first argument instead of `null`, which could lead to the caller receiving an error value (which may be `undefined` at that point) instead of a successful callback, altering the expected flow of error handling.

DONE.
