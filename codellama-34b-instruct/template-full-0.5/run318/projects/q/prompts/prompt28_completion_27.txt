  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object in JavaScript, whereas `domain` is a variable in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript, whereas `domain` is a variable that may or may not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value in JavaScript, whereas `domain` is a variable that may or may not be defined.

DONE.
