  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will flip the sign of the value, resulting in a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(b, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the square of the value, resulting in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the logarithm of the value, resulting in a different result.

DONE.
