 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always add a progress listener, even when it's not needed, potentially causing unnecessary processing or memory usage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would stop adding progress listeners, which could cause issues if any part of the codebase relies on those listeners being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add a random number of progress listeners, which could cause unpredictable behavior or issues in the codebase.

DONE.
