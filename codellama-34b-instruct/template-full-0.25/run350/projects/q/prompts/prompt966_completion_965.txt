  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `void 0` is a more obscure way of writing `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `void 0` is a more obscure way of writing `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, while `void 0` is a more obscure way of writing `undefined`.

DONE.
