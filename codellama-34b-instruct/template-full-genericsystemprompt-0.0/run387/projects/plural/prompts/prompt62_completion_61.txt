  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "bacterium" with a new one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteriums')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "bacterium" with a new one that has a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "bacterium" with a new one that has the same plural form.

DONE.
