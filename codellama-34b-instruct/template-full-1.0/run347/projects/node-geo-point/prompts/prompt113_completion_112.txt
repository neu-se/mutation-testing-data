  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression would be off by an extra 1 degree, which could cause the tile number calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression would be half of what it should be, causing the tile number calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the expression would be off by an extra 1 degree in the opposite direction, causing the tile number calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
