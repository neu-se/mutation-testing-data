  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if either `this` or `z` is infinite, whereas the original code fragment would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['ZERO']` if either `this` or `z` is zero, whereas the original code fragment would only return `Complex['ZERO']` if `this` is zero and `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['NAN']
