  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== "function" && define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition and always return `false`, even if the `define` function is defined and has an `amd` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined and if its `amd` property is undefined, which would always return `false` if the `define` function is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `define` function is defined and if its `amd` property is not a function, which would always return `false` if the `define` function is defined.

DONE.
