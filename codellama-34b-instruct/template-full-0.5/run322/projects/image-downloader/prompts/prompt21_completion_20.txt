  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is a string, and `toUpperCase()` method returns the uppercase version of the string, which may not be the same as the original `options.dest` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is a string, and `length` property returns the length of the string, which may not be the same as the original `options.dest` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is a string, and `split()` method returns an array of substrings, which may not be the same as the original `options.dest` value.

DONE.
