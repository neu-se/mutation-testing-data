  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function is not called with the correct arguments. The `reject` function is called with the `reason` argument, but `become` expects a promise as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function is not called with the correct arguments. The `Q.reject` function expects a promise as its argument, but `become` expects a promise as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function is not called with the correct arguments. The `fulfill` function expects a promise as its argument, but `become` expects a promise as its argument.

DONE.
