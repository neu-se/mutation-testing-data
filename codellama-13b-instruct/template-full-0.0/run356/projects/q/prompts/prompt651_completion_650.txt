  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on a promise. This could result in different behavior if the object or promise has a different implementation of the "post" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "apply" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "apply" method to invoke a method on a promise. This could result in different behavior if the object or promise has a different implementation of the "apply" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"when"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "when" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "when" method to invoke
