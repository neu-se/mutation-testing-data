 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array, so any modifications to the original `promises` array will not affect the processed array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the values of the `promises` object if it's not an actual array, which may cause unexpected behavior if the original code expects an array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.filter(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any falsy values from the `promises` array, which may not include some promises that the original code expects to be processed.

DONE.
