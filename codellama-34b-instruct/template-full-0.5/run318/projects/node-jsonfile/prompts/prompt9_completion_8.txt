  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which would change the output of the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `data` by 2, which would change the output of the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `data` would be accessed, which would return the length of the string representation of the JSON data, rather than the actual data itself.

DONE.
