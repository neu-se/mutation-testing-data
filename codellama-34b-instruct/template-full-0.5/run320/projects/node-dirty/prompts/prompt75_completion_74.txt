  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the `load` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the `load` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the `load` event.

DONE.
