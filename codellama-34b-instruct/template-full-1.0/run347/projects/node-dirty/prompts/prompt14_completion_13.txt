  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, while `cbs.push` adds an element to the end of the array. This could potentially cause issues with the callback queue, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length of the callback array to 1, effectively clearing all callbacks except for the first one. This could potentially cause issues with the callback queue, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs = cbs.filter(cb => cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the callback array to only include non-null values. This could potentially cause issues with the callback queue, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
