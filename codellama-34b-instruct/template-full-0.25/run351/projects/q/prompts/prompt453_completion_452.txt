  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the `unhandledReasons` array to be modified in a different way than the original code, which could potentially cause the `trackRejection` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the `unhandledReasons` array to be modified in a different way than the original code, which could potentially cause the `trackRejection` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes
