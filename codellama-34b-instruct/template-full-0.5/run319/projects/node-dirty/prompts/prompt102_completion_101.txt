  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete()` only removes the element with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` would overwrite the existing value with `undefined`, while `delete()` would remove the element altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` would remove the element from the map, while `set()` would overwrite the existing value with `undefined`.

DONE.
