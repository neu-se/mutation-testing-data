  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `op` function to be called with `null` instead of `data`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `op` function to be called with `undefined` instead of `data`, which may also cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the `op` function to be called with `0` instead of `data`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
