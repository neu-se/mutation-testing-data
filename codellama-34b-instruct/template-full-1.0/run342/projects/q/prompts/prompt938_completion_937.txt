  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` with only two arguments returns a slice of the original array, starting from the first index and containing only one element. In contrast, `array_slice(arguments, 1)` without the third argument returns a slice of the original array starting from the first index and containing all elements up to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 5)` would start the slice from the fifth argument, skipping the first four, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)` would start the slice from the first argument and only contain the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(
