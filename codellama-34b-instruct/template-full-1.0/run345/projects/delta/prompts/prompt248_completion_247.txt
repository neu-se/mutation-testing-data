  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the "other" iterator instead of the "this" iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum length of the two iterators instead of the length of the "this" iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the total length of the "this" iterator's operations instead of the length of the current operation.

DONE.
