  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is a number, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is a string, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is `undefined`, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return `null`.

DONE.
