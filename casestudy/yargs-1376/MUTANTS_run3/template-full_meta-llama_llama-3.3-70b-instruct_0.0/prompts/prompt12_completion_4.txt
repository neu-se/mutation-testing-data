Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the existence of a property named 'extend' instead of 'extends', which could lead to incorrect handling of configuration files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defaultConfig, 'extends'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking the existence of the 'extends' property in the defaultConfig object instead of the config object, which could cause the function to incorrectly handle the configuration extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extends' && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now always evaluating to true due to the '&& true' expression, which means it will always attempt to extend the configuration, even if the 'extends' property does not exist in the config object.

DONE.
