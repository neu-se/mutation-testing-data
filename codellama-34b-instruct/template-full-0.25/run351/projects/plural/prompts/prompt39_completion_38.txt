  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'`, which would remove the last two characters of the word and add 'ices', resulting in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices'`, which would remove the last character of the word and add 'ices', resulting in a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result
