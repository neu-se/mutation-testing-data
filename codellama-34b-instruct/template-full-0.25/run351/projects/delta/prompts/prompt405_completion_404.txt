  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with a different argument, potentially returning a different handler object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType, otherData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with a different number of arguments, potentially returning a different handler object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherData, embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with a different argument order, potentially returning a different handler object.

DONE.
