  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the expression and affect the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the formula used in the calculation and produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a different variable and potentially produce a different result.

DONE.
