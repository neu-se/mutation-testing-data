  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the current element and move to the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the current element and move to the next two elements.

DONE.
