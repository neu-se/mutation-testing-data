 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(task, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `setTimeout` instead of the original `runSingle`, which may cause the task to be executed asynchronously in a future event loop instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
task();
```
This would result in different behavior because it executes the task synchronously, instead of scheduling it for a future turn of the event loop as the original `runSingle` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.setImmediate(task);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `setImmediate` instead of the original `runSingle`, which may cause the task to be executed in a different order or at a different time than intended, depending on the implementation of `setImmediate` in the environment.

DONE.
