  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is one less than the actual length of the next operation in the `other` iterator, which could cause the `while` loop to terminate prematurely or skip over certain operations.
