Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the delete operation from the index instead of the offset, potentially leading to incorrect index calculations when multiple operations are involved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the index instead of decreasing it, which could cause the index to point to an invalid position in the context of the operations being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively ignore the effect of the delete operation on the index, causing the index to remain unchanged regardless of the number of characters deleted, leading to incorrect transformations.

DONE.
