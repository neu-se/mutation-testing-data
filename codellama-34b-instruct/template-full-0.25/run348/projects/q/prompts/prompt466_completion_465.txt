  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks if the value of `atReport` is greater than -1, whereas the original code used the `!==` operator to check if the value of `atReport` is not equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks if the value of `atReport` is equal to -2, whereas the original code used the `!==` operator to check if the value of `atReport` is not equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks if the value of `atReport` is less than -1, whereas the original code used the `!==` operator to check if the value of `atReport` is not equal to -1.
