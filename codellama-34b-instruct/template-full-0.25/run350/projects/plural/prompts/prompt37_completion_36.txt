  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'` to pluralize words that end with "ix", but this replacement code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices'` which would pluralize words that end with "x" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'` to pluralize words that end with "ix", but this replacement code fragment uses `w.substr(0,
