  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `iter` object, which would return the next value in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean indicating whether there are more values in the iteration.

DONE.
