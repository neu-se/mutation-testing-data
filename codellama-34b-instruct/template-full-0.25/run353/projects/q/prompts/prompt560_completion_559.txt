  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` variable is used to determine if the generator has reached its end, and setting it to `false` would cause the generator to continue iterating even after it has stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration = !isStopIteration;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of `isStopIteration` between `true` and `false` on each iteration, causing the generator to alternate between stopping and continuing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration = Math.random() < 0.5;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly set `isStopIteration` to either `true` or `false` on each iteration, causing the generator to randomly stop and continue.

DONE.
