  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This is the original code fragment, which is correct and should not be changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort
```
This is a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment. It is missing the `onAbort` parameter, which is required for the `abortCb` function to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort
```
This is a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment. It is missing the `abort` parameter, which is required for the `abortCb` function to work correctly.

DONE.
