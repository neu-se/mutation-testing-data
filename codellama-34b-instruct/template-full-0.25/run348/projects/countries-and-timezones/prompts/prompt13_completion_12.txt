  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` arrays would be initialized with the same value, `id`, instead of being empty arrays as in the original code. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different object, with the `current` and `all` arrays containing the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` arrays would be initialized with the same value, `id`, instead of being empty arrays as in the original code.
