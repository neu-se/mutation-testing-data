  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the entire word, while the new code fragment uses the word without the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the entire word, while the new code fragment uses the word with the characters reversed.

DONE.
