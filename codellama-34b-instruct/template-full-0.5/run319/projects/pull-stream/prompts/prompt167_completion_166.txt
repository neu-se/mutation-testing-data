  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value passed as the second argument to `abortCb` would cause the function to always return `null`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is not defined in the current scope, so this would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, i, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not defined in the current scope, so this would cause a reference error.

DONE.
