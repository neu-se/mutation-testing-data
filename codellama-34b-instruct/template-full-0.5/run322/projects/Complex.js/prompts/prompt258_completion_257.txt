  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is less than 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently for negative values of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is 0 and `a` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently for non-zero values of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 || a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while
