  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a negative argument, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, which could result in a different iteration order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain / firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, which could result in a different iteration order.

DONE.
