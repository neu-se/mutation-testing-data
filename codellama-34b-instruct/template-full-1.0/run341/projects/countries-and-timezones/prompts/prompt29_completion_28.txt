  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, instead of the quotient of `offset` divided by 60, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 60 to `offset`, instead of dividing it by 60, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60.0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a floating-point division, instead of integer division, which could result in different results for certain inputs.

DONE.
