  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect(this).state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a recursive call to the `inspect` method, potentially leading to a stack overflow or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect(this.value).state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would inspect the `value` property of the promise, rather than the promise itself. This could potentially lead to a different result, depending on the implementation of the `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect(this.reason).state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would inspect the `reason` property of the promise, rather than the promise itself. This could potentially lead to a different result, depending on the implementation of the `inspect` method.

DONE.
