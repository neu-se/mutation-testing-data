  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `8, -1` would return the last 8 characters of the input string, while the new code fragment `slice(-1)` would return the last character of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
slice(0, -3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `8, -1` would return the first 8 characters of the input string, while the new code fragment `slice(0, -3)` would return all but the last 3 characters of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
slice(0, 8)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `8, -1` would return the first 8 characters of the input string, while the new code fragment `slice(0, 8)` would return all the characters from the input string up to but not including the 8
