  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of the error, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(new Error())` would reject the promise with a new error, rather than the original error, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
