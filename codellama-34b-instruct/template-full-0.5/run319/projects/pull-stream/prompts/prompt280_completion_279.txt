  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the `mapper` function to be called with an argument of `1`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function would be called with two arguments, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function would be called with two arguments, the second of which is a constant, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
