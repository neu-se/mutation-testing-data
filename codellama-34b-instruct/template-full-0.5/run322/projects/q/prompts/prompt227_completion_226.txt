  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if the promise is not resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if the promise is resolved.

DONE.
