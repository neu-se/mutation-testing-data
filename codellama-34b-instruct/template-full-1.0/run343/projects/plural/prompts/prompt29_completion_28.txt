  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned plural form would be different for words like "thesis" and "crisis" which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned plural form would be the same for words like "thesis" and "crisis" which would cause the test to pass.
