  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "apply" method to invoke the function, while the buggy code fragment uses the "apply" method to invoke the function with the "this" context set to the global object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "call" method to invoke the function, while the buggy code fragment uses the "call" method to invoke the function with the "this" context set to the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "bind" method to create a bound function, while the buggy code fragment uses the "bind" method to create a bound function with the "this" context set to the global object.

DONE.
