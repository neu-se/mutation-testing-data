  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `b` object instead of the `a` object, potentially causing the `compose` function to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in a && key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only iterate over the keys that are present in both the `a` and `b` objects, potentially causing the `compose` function to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in a || key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys that are present in either the `a` or `b` objects, potentially causing the `compose` function to produce different results.

DONE.
