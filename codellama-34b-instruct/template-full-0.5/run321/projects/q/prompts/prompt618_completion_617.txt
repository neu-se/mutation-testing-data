  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the `key` argument to the `get` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the `key` and `value` arguments to the `get` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `value` argument to the `get` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
