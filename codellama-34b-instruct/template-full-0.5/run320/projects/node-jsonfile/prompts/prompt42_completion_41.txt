  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the stringified version of the object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(stringify(obj, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the parsed version of the stringified object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options).replace(/\\/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the stringified version of the object, with all backslashes removed.

DONE.
