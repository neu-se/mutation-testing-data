  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a buffer, so the `if` statement would not be executed, and the content would not be converted to a utf8 string using `toString('utf8')`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content.slice(0, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(0, 1)` returns a different buffer than `content`, so the `if` statement would be executed even if `content` is not a buffer, and the content would be converted to a utf8 string using `toString('utf8')`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would invert the Boolean value returned by `Buffer.isBuffer`, so the `if` statement would be executed even if `content` is a buffer
