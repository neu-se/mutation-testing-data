  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array and `array_slice` would return an empty array, which would cause the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed to `array_slice`, which would return an empty array, which would cause the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive an array with three elements, which would cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
