  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would receive a `null` value as the `promise` argument, which would cause it to not remove the `promise` from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to a difference in the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would receive an `undefined` value as the `promise` argument, which would cause it to not remove the `promise` from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to a difference in the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would receive a resolved promise as the `promise` argument, which would cause it to remove the `promise` from the `unhandledRejections
