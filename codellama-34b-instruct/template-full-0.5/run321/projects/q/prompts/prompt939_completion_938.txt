  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.concat` creates a new array by concatenating `baseArgs` and `args`, while `baseArgs + args` would result in the concatenation of the string representations of `baseArgs` and `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.concat` creates a new array by concatenating `baseArgs` and `args`, while `baseArgs.push(args)` would result in `args` being appended to `baseArgs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[baseArgs, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.concat` creates a new array by concatenating `baseArgs` and `args`, while `[baseArgs, args]` would result in a new array containing `baseArgs` and `args` as elements.

DONE.
