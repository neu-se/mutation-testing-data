  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, reversed(baseOp.attributes))
```
This would result in different behavior because `reversed()` is not a valid method on `AttributeMap`, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not a valid argument for the `transform()` method of `AttributeMap`, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` is not a valid method on `AttributeMap`, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
