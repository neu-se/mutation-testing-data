  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `point.coordinates` is an array and has a length of 2, whereas the original code only checks if `point.coordinates` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `point.coordinates` has a length of 2, whereas the original code checks if `point.coordinates` is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `point.coordinates` has a length greater than 2, whereas the original code checks if `point.coordinates` has a length of 2.

DONE.
