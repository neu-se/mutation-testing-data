  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `arg` is a string and has a length of 0, while this replacement checks if `arg` is a number, which would cause the `insert` method to return `this` without pushing a new operation to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `arg` is a string and has a length of 0, while this replacement checks if `arg` has a length greater than 0, which would cause the `insert` method to push a new operation to the `ops` array even if `arg` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `arg` is a string and has a length of 0, while this replacement checks
