  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected("new error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different error message, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("new error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a new error message, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a different error.

DONE.
