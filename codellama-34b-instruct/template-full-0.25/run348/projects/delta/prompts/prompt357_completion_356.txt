  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 0, while this modified code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 0, while this modified code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 0, while this modified code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 0 times 2.

DONE.
