  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the retained text instead of retaining it with inverted attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain an empty string instead of the original text with inverted attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain a deleted text instead of the original text with inverted attributes.

DONE.
