  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, which could cause the code to fail if the input string contains uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/i.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive, which could cause the code to pass if the input string contains uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now being used as a test, which could cause the code to fail if the input string does not match the regular expression.

DONE.
