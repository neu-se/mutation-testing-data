  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles fulfilled promises, while `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises. By replacing `_rejected` with `_fulfilled`, the promise would be fulfilled instead of rejected, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises, and passing `null` as the exception would cause the promise to be rejected with a different exception than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises, and passing a new error object as the exception would cause the promise to be rejected with a different exception than the original code.

DONE
