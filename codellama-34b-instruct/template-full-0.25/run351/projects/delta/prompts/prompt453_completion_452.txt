  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property is being set to a fixed value of 1, instead of being calculated based on the current index and offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = this.ops.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property is being set to the last index of the `ops` array, instead of being incremented based on the current index and offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` array is being set to an empty array, instead of being populated with the original operations.

DONE.
