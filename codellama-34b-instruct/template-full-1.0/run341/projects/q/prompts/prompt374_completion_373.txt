  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function is not called, and the original exception will not have its stack trace modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 reject(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function will be called with the modified exception, which may have a different stack trace that includes the `makeStackTraceLong` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function will be called with the result of calling `toJSON()` on the modified exception, which may include additional information about the exception that was not present in the original stack trace.

DONE.
