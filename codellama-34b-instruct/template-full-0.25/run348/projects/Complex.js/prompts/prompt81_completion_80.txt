  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a minus sign, while this replacement checks for a plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a minus sign, while this replacement checks for a multiplication sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a minus sign, while this replacement checks for a division sign.

DONE.
