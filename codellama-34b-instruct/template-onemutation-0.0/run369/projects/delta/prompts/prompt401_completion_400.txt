  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length` is a number, while `thisData` is an object. In the original code, `thisData` is used as an object, and its properties are accessed and modified. If `thisData.length` is used instead, the code would likely produce a different result or error, as it would be trying to access the `length` property of a number, which is not defined.
