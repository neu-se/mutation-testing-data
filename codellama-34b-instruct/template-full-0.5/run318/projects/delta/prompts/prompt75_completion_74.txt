  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneShallow
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneShallow` creates a shallow copy of the object, while `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy. In the context of the code, this could cause issues if the object being copied has nested properties, as the shallow copy would not include those nested properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneArray` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy. In the context of the code, this could cause issues if the array being copied has nested arrays, as the shallow copy would not include those nested arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneObject` creates a shallow copy of the object, while `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy. In the context of the code, this could cause issues if the object being copied has
