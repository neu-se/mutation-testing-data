  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name`, while this new code fragment checks if the property exists and is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezones.hasOwnProperty(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name`, while this new code fragment checks if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name` that is not inherited from its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name`, while this new code fragment checks if the property exists and is `null`.

DONE.
