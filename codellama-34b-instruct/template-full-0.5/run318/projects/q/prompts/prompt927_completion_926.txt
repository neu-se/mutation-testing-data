  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a valid array as its first argument, but `null` is not a valid array. Instead of slicing the array, the function would throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a valid array as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a valid array. Instead of slicing the array, the function would throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a valid array as its first argument, but an empty object `{}` is not a valid array. Instead of slicing the array
