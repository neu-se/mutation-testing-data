  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the closest integer to the given value, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of the given value. This could potentially cause issues in the function's calculation of the UTC offset and DST offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(input * -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the input value, which could affect the calculation of the UTC and DST offsets.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(input % 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the remainder of the input value when divided by 2, which could affect the calculation of the UTC and DST offsets.

DONE.
