  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next operation in the iteration, rather than returning the next operation as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next operation in the other iteration, rather than returning the next operation as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation, rather than the next operation, in the iteration.

DONE.
