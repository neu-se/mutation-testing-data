 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('base')[0].attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the first 'base' element directly, which may not always exist, causing a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it looks for the 'base' element within the 'body' tag, which may not always be present, causing a potential mismatch or undefined result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
document.querySelector('base').getAttribute('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the native `querySelector` method, which may not be compatible with the Cheerio library used in the original code, causing a potential mismatch or error.

DONE.
