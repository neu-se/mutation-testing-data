  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
