 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attr[key] !== undefined && base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key exists in `attr` instead of checking if the value is different from `base`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attr[key] === null && base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value in `attr` is `null` instead of checking if the values are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] === undefined
