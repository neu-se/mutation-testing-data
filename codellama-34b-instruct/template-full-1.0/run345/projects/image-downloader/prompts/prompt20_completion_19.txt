  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for relative paths, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for absolute paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for relative paths, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` for absolute paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isFile(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the path points to a file, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` for files and directories.

DONE.
