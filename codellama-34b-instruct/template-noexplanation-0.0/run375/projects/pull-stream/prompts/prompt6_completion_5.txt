  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.keys()
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the keys of the `throughs` object, rather than the values. This may cause the loop to skip over some values or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.values()
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the values of the `throughs` object, rather than the keys. This may cause the loop to produce unexpected results or skip over some values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.entries()
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the entries of the `throughs` object, which are arrays containing the key and value for each property. This may cause the loop to produce unexpected results or skip over some values.

DONE.
