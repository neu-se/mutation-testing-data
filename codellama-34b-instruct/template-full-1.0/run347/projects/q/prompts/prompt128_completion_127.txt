  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a non-existent property on the object, rather than checking the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check a different key than the original code, potentially accessing a different property on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
TypeError()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, rather than returning a boolean value.

DONE.
