  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a specified number of milliseconds, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, 1)` would schedule the `flush` function to be executed after 1 millisecond, while `setImmediate(flush)` would schedule the `flush` function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, 0)` would schedule the `flush` function to be executed after 0 milliseconds, which is equivalent to executing the function synchronously.

DONE.
