  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `b` by 2, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b`, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
