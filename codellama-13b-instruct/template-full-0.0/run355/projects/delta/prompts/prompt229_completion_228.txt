  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, but adding 1 to it would cause the code to skip over the next operation and potentially result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, but subtracting 1 from it would cause the code to process the next operation twice, potentially resulting in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, but multiplying it by 2 would cause the
