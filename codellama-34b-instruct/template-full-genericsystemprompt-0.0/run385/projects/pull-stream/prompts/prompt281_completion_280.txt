  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function, but `mapper + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function, but `mapper.length` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function, but `mapper.call(null, data)` is a function call that returns a value.

DONE.
