  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, but the new code fragment `function () {}` is a function that does nothing, so the progress value would not be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { throw value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, but the new code fragment `function (value) { throw value; }` is a function that throws an exception with the progress value, so the progress value would not be handled and the promise would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, but the new code fragment `function (value) { return
