  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `attributes` object with a new, empty object, which would modify the original object. This is different from the original code fragment, which simply returns the `attributes` object without modification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.mapValues(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapValues` method would transform each value in the `attributes` object, which would modify the original object. This is different from the original code fragment, which simply returns the `attributes` object without modification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value for the specified key in the `attributes` object, which would only return a single value instead of the entire object. This is different from the original code fragment, which simply returns the `attributes` object without modification
