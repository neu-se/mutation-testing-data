  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would be called on the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is a string, and not on the `urlMap` object. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would be called on the `baseUrl` variable, which is an object, and not on the `urlMap` object. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr, baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would be called on the `urlMap` object with two arguments, which is not a valid usage of the method. This would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
