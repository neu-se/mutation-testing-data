  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` returns the cube root of a number, which is different from the square root returned by `Math.sqrt`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential function of a number, which is different from the square root returned by `Math.sqrt`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and it has a different value than the square root of 2.

DONE.
