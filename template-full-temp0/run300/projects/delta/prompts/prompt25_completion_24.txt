  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `+` operator, which performs addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] - b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `-` operator, which performs subtraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] * b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `*` operator, which performs multiplication.

DONE.
