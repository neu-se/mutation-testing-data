  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op, while `peekLength` returns the number of operations remaining in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next op, while `peekLength` returns the number of operations remaining in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length` returns the total number of ops in the iterator, while `peekLength` returns the number of operations remaining in the iterator.

DONE.
