  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise).tap` returns the original promise, while `Q(promise).then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { return undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise).tap` returns the original promise, while `Q(promise).then` returns a new promise that is resolved with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function () { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promise).tap` returns the original promise, while `Q(promise).then` returns a new promise that is rejected with an error.

DONE.
