  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.baseurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.has()` takes the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object as an argument, which is not the same as the `url` property that was passed to the `has()` method in the original code. This would cause the code to check if the `baseurl` of the current URL is in the `urlMap`, which would likely produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.protocol + currentUrl.host + currentUrl.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the protocol, host, and path of the current URL and pass that string to the `has()` method. This would cause the code to check if the concatenated string is in the `urlMap`, which would likely produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.
