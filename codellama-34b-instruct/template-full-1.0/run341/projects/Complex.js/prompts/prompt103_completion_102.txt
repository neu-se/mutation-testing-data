  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require there to be at least two operators (+ or -) before any digits in the string, whereas the original code would allow for there to be at least one operator before any digits in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require there to be at least one digit in the string, whereas the original code would allow for there to be no digits in the string and still match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus - plus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require there to be at least one digit in the string and for the number of digits before the first operator to be greater than the number of digits after the first operator, whereas the original code would allow for there to be no digits in the string and for the number of digits before the first operator to be equal to or greater than
