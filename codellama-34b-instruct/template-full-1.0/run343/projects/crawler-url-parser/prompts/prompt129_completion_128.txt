  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse { url: "http://www.example.com" }
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `url` constant is reassigned to the result of `URL.parse`, which is an object with properties `protocol`, `host`, `path`, etc. However, in this modified code, `url` is assigned the string "http://www.example.com/", which does not have the same properties as the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(url)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `baseUrlStr` is reassigned to the result of `URL.parse`, which is an object with properties `protocol`, `host`, `path`, etc. However, in this modified code, `baseUrlStr` is assigned a string, which does not have the same properties as the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new URL.URL(url
