  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `op` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `op`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `op` is greater than or equal to 1, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of `op`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `op` is a string that is not empty, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
