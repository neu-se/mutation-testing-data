 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<any>
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any type of value to be passed, potentially causing type errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length to -1, which can cause issues in the calculation of the index and length of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length to a very large number, potentially causing issues in the calculation of the index and length of the line, and may lead to an infinite loop in the code.

DONE.
