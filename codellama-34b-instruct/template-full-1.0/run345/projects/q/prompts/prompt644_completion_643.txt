  Sure, here are three potential mutations of the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
boo
```
This would result in different behavior because `boo` is an undefined variable, which will cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const foo = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because `const foo = "foo"` assigns a constant variable `foo` to the string "foo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bar".translate
```
This would result in different behavior because `translate` is a built-in JavaScript string method, and `bar` is a string literal. The code would attempt to call the `translate` method on the string "bar" but would fail because it cannot be translated.

DONE.
