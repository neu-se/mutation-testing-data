  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it always calls the callback with `null` as the first argument, regardless of whether the test passed or failed. This can cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This code fragment is another buggy version of the original code, as it always calls the callback with `data` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, regardless of whether the test passed or failed. This can cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it always calls the callback with `null` as both arguments, regardless of whether the test passed or failed. This can cause the test suite to pass even if
