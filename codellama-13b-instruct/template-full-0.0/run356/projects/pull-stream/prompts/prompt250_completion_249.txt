  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with two arguments, `null` and `data`. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with one argument, `err`. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting one argument.

DONE.
