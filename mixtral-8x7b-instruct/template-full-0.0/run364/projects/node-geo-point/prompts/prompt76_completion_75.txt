 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` constant would always result in the same bearing value, regardless of the input, causing the `calculateDestination` method to not work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), causing the `calculateDestination` method to generate different destination points for the same input, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because using the `latitude` property instead of the `longitude` property would cause the `calculateDestination` method to not work correctly, as it would use the wrong coordinate for calculating the destination point.

DONE.
