  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function, and `!prop` would return the opposite of what `prop` returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `null` cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `undefined` cannot be called as a function.

DONE.
