  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `progressed` variable, which could cause the `then` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of the `progressed` variable, which could cause the `then` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of the `progressed` variable, which could cause the `then` method to behave differently.

DONE.
