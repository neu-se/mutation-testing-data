  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cosh` function, which is defined as `Math.cosh || function(x) { return Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 1 - x : (Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5; }`, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function directly. The `cosh` function is a more accurate approximation of the hyperbolic cosine function, while the `Math.exp` function is a more basic function that only computes the exponential function. The `cosh` function is more suitable for this application because it is more accurate and can handle larger values of `x` without overflowing.

DONE.
