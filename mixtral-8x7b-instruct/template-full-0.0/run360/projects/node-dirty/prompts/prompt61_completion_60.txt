 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.unlinkSync(this.path);
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the file instead of closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because it stops the read stream from emitting data, instead of closing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream = null;
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because it destroys the write stream without closing the read stream.

DONE.
