  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if the length of the line is less than 0. This would cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently when the line length is 0 or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if the length of the line is equal to 0. This would cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently when the line length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if the length of the
