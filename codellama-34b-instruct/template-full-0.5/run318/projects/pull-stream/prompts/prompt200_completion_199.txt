  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of the `busy` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `busy` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `busy` is not only `true`, but also a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `busy` is not only `false`, but also a boolean value.

DONE.
