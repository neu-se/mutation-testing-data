  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value as is, while this new code fragment returns the value plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value as is, while this new code fragment returns the value minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value as is, while this new code fragment returns the value multiplied by 2.

DONE.
