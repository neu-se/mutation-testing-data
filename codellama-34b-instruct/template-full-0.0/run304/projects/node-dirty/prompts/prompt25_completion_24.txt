  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback if it is defined, while this new code fragment would call the callback regardless of whether it is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with no arguments, while this new code fragment would call the callback with a null argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with no arguments, while this new code fragment would call the callback with an Error object as an argument.

DONE.
