Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^[a-z]$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to match only lowercase letters instead of non-digit characters, potentially altering the prefix added to the switch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the regular expression test with a Boolean function, which would always return true for non-empty strings and false for empty strings, changing the logic of adding the prefix to the switch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sw => sw.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to add the prefix based on the length of the switch string instead of its content, potentially altering the output for switches with different lengths.

DONE.
