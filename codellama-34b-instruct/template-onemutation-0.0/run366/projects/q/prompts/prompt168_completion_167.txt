  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isInternalFrame(line)` and `!isNodeFrame(line)` conditions would be evaluated first, and the `line` variable would only be evaluated if both conditions are true. In the original code, the `line` variable is only evaluated if either condition is false.

DONE.
