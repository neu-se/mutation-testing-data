  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `end` is `true`, instead of returning the original value of `acc`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? acc : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original value of `acc` if `end` is `true`, instead of returning `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? acc : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original value of `acc` if `end` is `true`, instead of returning the value of `end`.

DONE.
