  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(1)` would terminate the process with an error code of 1, whereas the original code would continue executing the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick(flush)` would schedule the `flush` function to be executed in the next tick, whereas the original code would execute it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, 1000)` would schedule the `flush` function to be executed after a delay of 1 second, whereas the original code would execute it immediately.

DONE.
