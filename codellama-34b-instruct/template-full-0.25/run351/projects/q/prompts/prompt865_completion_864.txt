  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a truthy value, but `null` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a defined value, but `undefined` is not a defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be an object with properties, but `{}` is an empty object with no properties.

DONE.
