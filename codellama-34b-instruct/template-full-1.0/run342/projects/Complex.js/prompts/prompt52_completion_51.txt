  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg'` is not a valid object property name, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a('arg')
```
This would result in different behavior because `a()` is not a function, and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is undefined, and would cause a reference error.

DONE.
