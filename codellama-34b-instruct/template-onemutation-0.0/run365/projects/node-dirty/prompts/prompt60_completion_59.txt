  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is a writable stream, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream. Using `this._writeStream` instead of `this._readStream` would cause the code to write to the file instead of reading from it, which would likely cause errors and unexpected behavior.

DONE.
