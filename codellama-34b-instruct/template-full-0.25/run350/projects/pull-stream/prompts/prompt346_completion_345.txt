This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method of the `RegExp` object in JavaScript, and it returns a boolean indicating whether or not the regular expression matches the given string. In contrast, `exec` returns an array of matches, or `null` if there are no matches.

```

```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method of the `String` object in JavaScript, and it returns the index of the first match, or `-1` if there are no matches. In contrast, `exec` returns
