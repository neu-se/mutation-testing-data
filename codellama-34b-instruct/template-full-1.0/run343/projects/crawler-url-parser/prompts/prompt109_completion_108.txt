  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, "https://www.google.com"
```
This would result in the `urlMap` containing the base URL (`currentUrl.url`) as the key and the string literal "https://www.google.com" as the value, instead of the actual `currentUrl` object. This would cause the `gettype` function to return a different type for the URL, which would result in a different output for the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in the `urlMap` containing the base URL (`currentUrl.url`) as the key and the base URL (`currentUrl.baseurl`) as the value, instead of the actual `currentUrl` object. This would cause the `gettype` function to return a different type for the URL, which would result in a different output for the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
