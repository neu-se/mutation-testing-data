  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code is calling it with a single argument. The function would still be called, but with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
read(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(err)` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code is calling it with only one argument. The function would still be called, but with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
return read(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a statement that returns control to the function that called `sink`, but the original code is not returning anything. The function would still be called, but with a different return value.

DONE.
