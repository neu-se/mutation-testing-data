  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the coordinates in the array, which may cause errors if the code relies on a specific order for the coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the array, which may cause errors if the code relies on a specific number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra element to the end of the array, which may cause errors if the code relies on a specific number of elements in the array.

DONE.
