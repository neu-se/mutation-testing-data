 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the invert() method would throw an error when trying to access the `opData` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the invert() method would now receive a random float number instead of the actual data, causing unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the invert() method would receive the `insert` property instead of the `retain` property, which could lead to incorrect behavior in certain cases.

DONE.
