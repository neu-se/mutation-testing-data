  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert` is a string, while `baseOp.attributes` is an object. In the original code, `baseOp.attributes` is used to retrieve the attributes of the operation, but if it is replaced with `baseOp.insert`, it will return the inserted string instead, which may not have the same attributes as the original operation.
