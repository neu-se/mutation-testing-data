  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` argument, which would return a timezone object with the given name, rather than the `timezone` object that is expected by the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` and `options` arguments, which would return a timezone object with the given name and options, rather than the `timezone` object that is expected by the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` and `options` arguments, where `options` is an object
