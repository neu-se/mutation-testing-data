Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always untrack the rejection regardless of whether the promise was actually rejected or not, leading to incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will never untrack the rejection, meaning that once a promise is rejected, it will always be considered unhandled, potentially causing memory leaks or incorrect state management.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it will attempt to untrack the rejection if the promise is fulfilled instead of rejected, which contradicts the intended logic of handling only rejected promises.

DONE.
