  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall()` is a function that returns a promise that is already resolved, while `Q` is a promise that may or may not be resolved yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` is a function that returns a promise that is already rejected, while `Q` is a promise that may or may not be resolved yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that returns a promise that is not yet resolved or rejected, while `Q` is a promise that may or may not be resolved yet.

DONE.
