  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the starting point instead of the latitude of the destination point, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the latitude of the destination point, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude of the destination point, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance and bearing.

DONE.
