Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the last index of the stack trace string instead of finding the first newline character, potentially including the entire stack trace instead of just the relevant portion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("at ") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it looks for the first occurrence of "at " in the stack trace, which may not correspond to the intended line break, leading to an incorrect starting point for the stack trace substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always starts the stack trace from the beginning, omitting the intended cut-off point after the first line, which could lead to a misleading or overly verbose stack trace.

DONE.
