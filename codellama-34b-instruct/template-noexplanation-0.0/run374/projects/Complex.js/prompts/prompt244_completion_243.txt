  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This will cause the `exp` method to return the sine of the complex number instead of the cosine, which will result in a different output for the `expm1` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This will cause the `exp` method to return the tangent of the complex number instead of the cosine, which will result in a different output for the `expm1` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This will cause the `exp` method to return the arccosine of the complex number instead of the cosine, which will result in a different output for the `expm1` method.

DONE.
