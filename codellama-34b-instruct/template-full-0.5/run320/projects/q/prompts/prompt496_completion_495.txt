  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection.message` is a string, whereas `rejection` is an object. In the original code, `rejection` is passed to `trackRejection`, which expects an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, whereas `rejection` is. In the original code, `rejection` is passed to `trackRejection`, which expects an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, whereas `rejection` is. In the original code, `rejection` is passed to `trackRejection`, which expects an object.

DONE.
