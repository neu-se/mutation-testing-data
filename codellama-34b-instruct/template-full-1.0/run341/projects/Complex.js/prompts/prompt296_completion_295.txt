  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an integer, whereas `a + 1` is a decimal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an integer, whereas `b - a` is a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an integer, whereas `Math.abs(a)` returns a positive integer or zero.

DONE.
