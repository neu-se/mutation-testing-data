  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, but the new code fragment checks if the complex number is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, but the new code fragment checks if the complex number is equal to one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](-1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, but the new code fragment checks if the complex number is equal to negative one.

DONE.
