  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an 's' to the end of the word regardless of the word's ending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an 'e' to the end of the word regardless of the word's ending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word and add 'ies' to the end, regardless of the word's ending.

DONE.
