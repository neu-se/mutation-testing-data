Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially allowing files to be opened with flags that are not intended for files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isSymbolicLink()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a symbolic link instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially throwing an error for symbolic links even if they are not being opened with flags that are not intended for directories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always throws an error, regardless of the type of node being opened, potentially preventing any files or directories from being opened with flags that are not intended for reading.

DONE.
