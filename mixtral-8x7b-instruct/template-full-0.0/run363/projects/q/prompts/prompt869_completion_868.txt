```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved promise would always have a `null` value instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Replacement error')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of resolving the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise
