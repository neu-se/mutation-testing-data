  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `promise` is a variable that holds a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `name` is a string variable that holds a name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `5` is a number.

DONE.
