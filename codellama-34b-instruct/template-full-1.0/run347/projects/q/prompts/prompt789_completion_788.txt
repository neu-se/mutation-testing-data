  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `then` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `then` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` would cause all promises to be resolved, whereas `then` would cause only the current promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
