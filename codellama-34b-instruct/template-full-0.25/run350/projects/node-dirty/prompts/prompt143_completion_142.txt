  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a new error object with the message "Something went wrong", which is different from the original error object that was passed to the event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null error object, which is different from the original error object that was passed to the event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the message property of the error object, which is different from the original error object that was passed to the event.

DONE.
