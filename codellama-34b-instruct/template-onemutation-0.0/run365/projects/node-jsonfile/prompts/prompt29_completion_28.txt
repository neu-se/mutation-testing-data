  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "buggy code"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stringify(obj, options)` is a function call that returns a string representation of the object, while the buggy code fragment `stringify(obj, options) + "buggy code"` is a string concatenation that appends the string "buggy code" to the result of the function call, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value or throw an error.
