  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as the first argument when the stream ends, indicating that there is no error. If `undefined` is used instead, the `cb` function will be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting a falsy value.
