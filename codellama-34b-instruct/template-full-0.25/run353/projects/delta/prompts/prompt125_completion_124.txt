  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peekType()` method only returns the type of the next operation, not its length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peekType()` method only returns the type of the next operation, not its length.
