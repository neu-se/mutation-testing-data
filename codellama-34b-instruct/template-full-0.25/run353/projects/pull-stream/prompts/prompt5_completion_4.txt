  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `throughs` is an object, and `throughs.reverse()` would return a reversed copy of the object, which is not what the code expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `throughs` is an object, and `throughs.length` would return the number of properties in the object, which is not what the code expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `throughs` is an object, and `throughs[0]` would return the first property of the object, which is not what the code expects.

DONE.
