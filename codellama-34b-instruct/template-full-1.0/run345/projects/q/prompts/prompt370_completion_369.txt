  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
except(_progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because `except` is not a defined function and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that only takes one argument, while `_progressed` is a function that takes multiple arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.resolve()` would be called immediately, while `_progressed` is only called in the callback of the `Q.nextTick` function.

DONE.
