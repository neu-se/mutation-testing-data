  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the latitude of the second point to be used in both calculations, leading to a different bearing and resulting destination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude of the first point to be used in both calculations, leading to a different bearing and resulting destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude of the second point to be used in both calculations, leading to a different bearing and resulting destination.

DONE.
