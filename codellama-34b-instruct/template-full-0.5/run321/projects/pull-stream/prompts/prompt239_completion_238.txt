  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function immediately instead of waiting for the `read` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `cb` function in the opposite order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `cb` function.

DONE.
