  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value, while the new code fragment would always return null, regardless of whether a value was present or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value, while the new code fragment would always return undefined, regardless of whether a value was present or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value, while the new code fragment would always return 0, regardless of whether a value was present or not.

DONE.
