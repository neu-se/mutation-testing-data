  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` method would be called with `reason` as the first argument, which is not a valid argument for that method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` method would be called with `promise` as the first argument, which is not a valid argument for that method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` method would be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not a valid argument for that method.

DONE.
