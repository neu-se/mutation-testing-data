  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred[generate]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is an array, and using `generate` instead of `next()` would cause the generator to produce a different sequence of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
?.generate();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?.` operator is a new proposal for JavaScript that allows you to safely call a method on an object, even if the object is null or undefined. This would change the behavior of the code because the generator would not produce any values if the object is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Void(generator.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Void(..)` is a function that returns `undefined` for any input, so calling `Void(generator.next())` would cause the generator to produce only undefined values, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
