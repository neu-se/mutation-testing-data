  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return an array of numbers, rather than an array of values. This will result in a different behavior than the original code, and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return an array of values, but with the first element removed. This will also result in a different behavior than the original code, and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.filter(function(x) { return x !== 0; })
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return an array of values, but with all elements that are equal to 0 removed. This will also result in a different behavior than the original code, and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

DONE.
