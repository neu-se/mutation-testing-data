 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `baseUrlStr` variable would not be reassigned. This could cause issues if the original code intended to update the `baseUrlStr` variable based on certain conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `baseUrlStr` variable would not be reassigned. This could cause issues if the original code intended to update the `baseUrlStr` variable based on certain conditions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true).host
