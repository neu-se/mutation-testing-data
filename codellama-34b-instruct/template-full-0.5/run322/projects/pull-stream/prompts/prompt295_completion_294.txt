  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && true` is always `true` when `err` is not `null` or `undefined`, whereas `err || true` is always `true` when `err` is not `null` or `undefined` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ? true : false` is always `true` when `err` is truthy, whereas `err || true` is always `true` when `err` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err || true` is always `true` when `err` is not `null` or `undefined`, whereas `err || true` is always `true` when `err` is not `null` or `undefined` or `false`.
