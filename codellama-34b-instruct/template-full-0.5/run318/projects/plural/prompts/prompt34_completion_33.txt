  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong substring for words that end with 'quy' (soliloquy). Instead of returning 'ies', it would return 'y'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong substring for words that end with 'quy' (soliloquy). Instead of returning 'ies', it would return 'y'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong substring for words that end with 'quy' (soliloquy). Instead of returning 'ies', it would return 'null'.

DONE.
