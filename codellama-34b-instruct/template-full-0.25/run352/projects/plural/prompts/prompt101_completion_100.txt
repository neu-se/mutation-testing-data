  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` would match any character, not just the letter "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/g, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match all occurrences of the letter "a", not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/i, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "i" flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match the letter "a" in a case-insensitive manner, not just the literal letter "a".

DONE.
