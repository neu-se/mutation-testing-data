Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is zero instead of checking if it is NaN, leading to incorrect string representation for complex numbers that are not zero but still contain NaN values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is finite instead of checking if it is NaN, which would incorrectly return a valid string representation for complex numbers that are actually NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, rather than checking for NaN values, which would lead to incorrect handling of complex numbers that are NaN.

DONE.
