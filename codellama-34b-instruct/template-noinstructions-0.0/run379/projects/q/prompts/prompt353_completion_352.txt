  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have thrown an exception, while the new code fragment would return a resolved promise with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have thrown an exception, while the new code fragment would return a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("PLACEHOLDER")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have thrown an exception, while the new code fragment would return a rejected promise with an error object containing the message "PLACEHOLDER".

DONE.
