  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, while the modified code fragment checks if the length of the line is less than 0. This would cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently when it encounters a line with a negative length.

DONE.
