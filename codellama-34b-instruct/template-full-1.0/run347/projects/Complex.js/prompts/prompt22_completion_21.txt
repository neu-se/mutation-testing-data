  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * b) + (a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the magnitude of the result, which would cause the `logHypot` function to return a larger value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * a) - (b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the magnitude of the result, which would cause the `logHypot` function to return a smaller value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation used to calculate the result, which would cause the `logHypot` function to return a different value.

DONE.
