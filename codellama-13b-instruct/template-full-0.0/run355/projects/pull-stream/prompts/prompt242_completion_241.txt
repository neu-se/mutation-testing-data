  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with an additional argument `null`, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with an additional argument `undefined`, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with an additional argument `0`, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
