  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses around the argument to the `sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `sin` function, but the replacement code fragment is using the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `sin` function, but the replacement code fragment is using the `tan` function.

DONE.
