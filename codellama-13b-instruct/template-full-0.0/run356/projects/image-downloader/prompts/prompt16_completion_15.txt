  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the destination path with the string "test" would cause the function to write the downloaded image to a different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, 'test')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would write the downloaded image to a subdirectory of the destination path, rather than overwriting the existing file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, 'test', 'test')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would write the downloaded image to a subdirectory of the destination path, rather than overwriting the existing file.

DONE.
