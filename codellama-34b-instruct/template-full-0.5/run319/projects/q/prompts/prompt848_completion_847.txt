  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `setTimeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `setTimeout` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always notify the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `setTimeout` function.

DONE.
