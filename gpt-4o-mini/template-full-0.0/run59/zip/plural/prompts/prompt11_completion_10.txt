Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes the last two characters of the word instead of just the last character, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "cherry" which should become "cherries".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'y' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last character with 'y' instead of 'ies', which would incorrectly pluralize "cherry" to "cherryy" instead of "cherries".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes the last character and appends 'ies', which would lead to incorrect pluralization for words that do not end in 'y', such as "toy" becoming "toies".

DONE.
