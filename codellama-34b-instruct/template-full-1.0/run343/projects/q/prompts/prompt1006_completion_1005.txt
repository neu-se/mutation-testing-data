  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ninvoke` method to return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that `null` does not have a `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ninvoke` method to return a resolved promise with the value `false`, rather than the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ninvoke` method to return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that an object does not have a `dispatch` method.

DONE.
