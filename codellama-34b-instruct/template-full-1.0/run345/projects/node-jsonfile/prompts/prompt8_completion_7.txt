  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would read the file synchronously, whereas the original code uses the `readFile` method which reads the file asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await fs.readFile(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would read the file asynchronously, whereas the original code uses the `readFileSync` method which reads the file synchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const fd = fs.openSync(file, 'r')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would open the file for reading, whereas the original code uses the `readFile` and `readFileSync` methods which read the file contents directly.

DONE.
