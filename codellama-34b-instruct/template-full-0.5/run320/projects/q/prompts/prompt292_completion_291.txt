  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a specified reason, whereas `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise of progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a specified value, whereas `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node-style callback that resolves or rejects the promise, whereas `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise of progress.

DONE.
