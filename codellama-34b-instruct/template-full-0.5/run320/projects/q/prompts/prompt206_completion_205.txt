  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === qFileName
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, while this replacement only checks if the first element of the array is equal to `qFileName`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1] >= qStartingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, while this replacement only checks if the second element of the array is greater than or equal to `qStartingLine`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1] <= qEndingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, while this replacement only checks if the second element of the array is less than or equal to `qEndingLine`.

DONE.
