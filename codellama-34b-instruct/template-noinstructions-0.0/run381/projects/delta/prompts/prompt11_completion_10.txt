  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, which could lead to unexpected results if the keys in `b` are not present in `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `a` instead of `b`, which could lead to unexpected results if the keys in `a` are not present in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a || b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `a` or `b`, whichever is defined, instead of iterating over the keys of both objects. This could lead to unexpected results if the keys in `a` or `b` are not present in the other object.

DONE.
