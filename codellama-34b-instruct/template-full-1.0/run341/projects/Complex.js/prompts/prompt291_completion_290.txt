  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function used for the real part of the complex number, which would give a different result for the `sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function used for the real part of the complex number, which would give a different result for the `tan` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function used for the real part of the complex number, which would give a different result for the `tanh` function.

DONE.
