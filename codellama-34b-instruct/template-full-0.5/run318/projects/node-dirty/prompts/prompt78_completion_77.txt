  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` would be called with the wrong `this` context, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` would be called with the wrong `this` context, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.emit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` would be called with the wrong `this` context, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
