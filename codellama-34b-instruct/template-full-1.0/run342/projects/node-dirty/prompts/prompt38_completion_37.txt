  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in this._data) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the object's keys using the `for...in` syntax, rather than using the `for...of` syntax, which could potentially lead to different behavior since `for...in` also iterates over inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(this._data)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Object.entries` to iterate over the object's entries (key-value pairs) rather than `for...of`. This could potentially lead to different behavior since `Object.entries` creates a new array for each entry, whereas `for...of` iterates over the existing entries in the Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `for
