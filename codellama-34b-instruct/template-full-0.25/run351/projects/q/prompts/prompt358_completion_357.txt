  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the provided value, which in this case is the `promise` object. This means that the `progressed` function will be called with the `promise` object as its `this` context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `progressed` function with the `promise` object as its `this` context, which is the same behavior as using `bind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `progressed` function with the `promise` object as its `this` context, which is the same behavior as using `call`.

DONE.
