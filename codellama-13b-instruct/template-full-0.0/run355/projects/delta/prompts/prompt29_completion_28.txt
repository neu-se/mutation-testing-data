  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `base` is a variable, while `base[key]` is a property accessor. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `base` variable is an object with a property named `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `base` is a variable, while `base.key` is a property accessor. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `base` variable is an object with a property named `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.key.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `base` is a variable, while `base.key.value` is a property accessor. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `base` variable is an object with a property named `key` that has a property named `
