  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.reject` is a function, and returning it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas `result.value` would return the value of the promise wrapped in a `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a null value, whereas `result.value` would return the value wrapped in a `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `result.value` with `throw "error"` would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error message, whereas `result.value` would return the value wrapped in a `Q` object.

DONE.
