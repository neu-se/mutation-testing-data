  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `resume` method, and it would throw an error. The original code fragment uses `res.resume()` without any arguments, which is a valid way to consume the response data and free up memory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(100);
```
This would result in different behavior because `100` is not a valid value for the `resume` method, and it would throw an error. The original code fragment uses `res.resume()` without any arguments, which is a valid way to consume the response data and free up memory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(res.data);
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.data` is not a valid property of the `res` object, and it would throw an error. The original code fragment
