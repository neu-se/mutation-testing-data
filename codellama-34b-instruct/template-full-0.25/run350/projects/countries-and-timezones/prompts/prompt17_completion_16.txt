  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is a different value than `id`, and it may not be a valid key in the `tzMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzMap[id]` is a different value than `id`, and it may not be a valid key in the `tzMap` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap[tz.r]
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzMap[tz.r]` is a different value than `id`, and it may not be a valid key in the `tzMap` object.

DONE.
