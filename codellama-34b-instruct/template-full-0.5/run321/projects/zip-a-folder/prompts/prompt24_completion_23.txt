  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bzip2"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archiver` method is called with the `bzip2` format instead of the `gzip` format, which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archiver` method is called with the `zip` format instead of the `gzip` format, which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archiver` method is called with the `tar` format instead of the `gzip` format, which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

DONE.
