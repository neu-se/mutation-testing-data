Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink.abort()` function to be called unconditionally, leading to an immediate abort of the reading process regardless of the actual state of the `abort` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, which may prevent the abort from being triggered if `end` is any other truthy value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the stream processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `sink.abort()` from being called at all, effectively ignoring the abort condition and allowing the reading process to continue indefinitely, which could lead to resource exhaustion or infinite loops.

DONE.
