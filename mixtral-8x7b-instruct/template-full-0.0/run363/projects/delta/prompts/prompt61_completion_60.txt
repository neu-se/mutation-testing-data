 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `undefined` instead of checking if `attributes` is an object with properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.entries(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are any key-value pairs in the `attributes` object instead of explicitly checking if there are any keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes && Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the "truthy" check for `attributes` instead of explicitly checking for `null`.

DONE.
