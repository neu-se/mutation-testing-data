  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function originally returned `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with the `data` argument, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with two arguments, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
