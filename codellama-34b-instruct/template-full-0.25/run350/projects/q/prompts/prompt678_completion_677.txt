  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the wrong number of arguments.

DONE.
