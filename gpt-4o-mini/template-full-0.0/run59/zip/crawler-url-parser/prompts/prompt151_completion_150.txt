Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host !== linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality instead of equality, meaning it would return true if the hosts are different, which is the opposite of the original logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.domain == linkurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the domains instead of the hosts, which may lead to a situation where two URLs with the same domain but different hosts are treated as the same, thus altering the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `linkurl` host is null instead of comparing it to the `pageurl` host, which would incorrectly categorize URLs based on the presence of a host rather than their actual host values.

DONE.
