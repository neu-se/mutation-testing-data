  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not the same as `null`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to produce different results.

DONE.
