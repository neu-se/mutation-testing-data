  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the expression, so if `prop` is a truthy value, it would become falsy, and vice versa. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch, potentially resulting in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `prop`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch, potentially resulting in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `prop` to `null`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch, potentially resulting in a different outcome.

DONE.
