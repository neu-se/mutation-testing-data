  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.all expects an array of promises as its argument, while spread expects a single promise or an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.then expects a promise as its argument, while spread expects a single value or an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.when expects a promise or a value as its argument, while spread expects a single value or an array of values.

DONE.
