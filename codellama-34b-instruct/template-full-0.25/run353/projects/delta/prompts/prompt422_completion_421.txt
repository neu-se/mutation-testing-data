  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code subtracts `offset` from `index`, while this replacement adds `offset` to `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code subtracts `offset` from `index`, while this replacement subtracts `index` from `offset`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(index - offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code subtracts `offset` from `index`, while this replacement takes the absolute value of the difference between `index` and `offset`.

DONE.
