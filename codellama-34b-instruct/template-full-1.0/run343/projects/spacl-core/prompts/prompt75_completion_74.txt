  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res > true
```
This would result in different behavior because in JavaScript, the `>` operator is used for comparison between two values, and `true` is a truthy value, so this expression would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used to check for strict equality between two values, and `true` is a truthy value, so this expression would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res ^ true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator is used for bitwise XOR between two values, and `true` is a truthy value, so this expression would always be false.

DONE.
