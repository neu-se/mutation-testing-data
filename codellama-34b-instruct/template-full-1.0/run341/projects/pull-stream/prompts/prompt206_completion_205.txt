  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a Boolean variable, and `aborted()` is a function call that is not defined anywhere in the code. The reference to the function would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted.toString()` would return the string representation of the `aborted` variable, which is different from the value of `aborted` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, which inverts the value of the expression. So if `aborted` is true, `!aborted` would be false, and vice versa.

DONE.
