  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end - 1` is truthy. This change would cause the function to return early if `end` is 1 or greater, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is falsy. This change would cause the function to return early if `end` is falsey, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end + 1` is truthy. This change would cause the function to return early if `
