  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the `attempt1` array, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `attempt1` array, which may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `attempt1` array, which may not exist.

DONE.
