  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the peeked operation by 1, potentially causing the `retain` operation to be applied to the wrong number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length of the peeked operation by 1, potentially causing the `retain` operation to be applied to the wrong number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing the `retain` operation to be applied to the wrong number of characters.

DONE.
