  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects the promise with a specified reason, whereas `notify` is a method that sends progress updates to the promise's observers. Using `reject` instead of `notify` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of sending a progress update, which would likely cause the promise's handlers to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with a specified value, whereas `notify` is a method that sends progress updates to the promise's observers. Using `resolve` instead of `notify` would cause the promise to be resolved with the deferred's promise, which would likely cause the promise's handlers to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value)
```
