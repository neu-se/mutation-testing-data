  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick` function would be called with a falsy value, which would cause it to return immediately without scheduling a task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick` function would be called with a null value, which would cause it to return immediately without scheduling a task.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick` function would be called with an undefined value, which would cause it to return immediately without scheduling a task.

DONE.
