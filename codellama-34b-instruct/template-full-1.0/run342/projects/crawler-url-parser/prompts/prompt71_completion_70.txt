  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').click(function (event) { return false; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the default click event on all anchors, potentially breaking the page's intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').parents('div:first').find('a').addClass('disabled');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a class to all anchors within the first div element containing the current anchor, potentially breaking the page's styling or functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').removeAttr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the href attribute from all anchors, potentially breaking the page's intended functionality.

DONE.
