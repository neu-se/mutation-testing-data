  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = newOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.delete` and `newOp.insert` would be assigned the same value, even if `newOp` is an object with different properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = newOp.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` and `newOp.delete` would be assigned the same value, even if `newOp` is an object with different properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { delete: newOp.insert };
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` would be reassigned a new object with a different value for the `delete` property, regardless of the original value of `newOp.insert`.

DONE.
