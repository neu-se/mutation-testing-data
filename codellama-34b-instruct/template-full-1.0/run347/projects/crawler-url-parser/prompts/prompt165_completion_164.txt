  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path[i].includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `includes()` on a string, but this code fragment uses it on an array, which would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `includes()` on a string, but this code fragment uses it on an array, which would return a different result. Additionally, the original code uses `includes()` on the first element of the array, but this code fragment uses it on the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path[pageurl_path.length-1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `includes()` on a string, but this code fragment uses it on an array, which would return a different result.
