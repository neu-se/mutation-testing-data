 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `spread` function is now a regular function instead of the `rejected` variable, which could cause the `spread` function to behave differently depending on how it utilizes this argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `spread` function is now `null`, which might cause issues if the `spread` function assumes the argument to be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'rejected'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `spread` function is now a string, while it was supposed to be a function. This change could cause the `spread` function to behave unexpectedly depending on how it utilizes this argument.

DONE.
