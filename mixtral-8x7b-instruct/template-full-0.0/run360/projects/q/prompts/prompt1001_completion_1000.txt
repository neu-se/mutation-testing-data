 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `dispatch` method from `Q(object)` to the current promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from the instance method `dispatch` to the static method `Q.dispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch("invalid", [name, nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of `dispatch` method from `"post"` to `"invalid"`, which might trigger different error handling or behavior within the method.

DONE.
