  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, rather than an array with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the last element removed, rather than the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(args.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the middle element removed, rather than the first element.

DONE.
