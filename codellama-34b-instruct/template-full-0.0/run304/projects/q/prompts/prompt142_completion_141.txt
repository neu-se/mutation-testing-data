  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property is not defined for the `source` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` property is not defined for the `source` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` property is not defined for the `source` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
