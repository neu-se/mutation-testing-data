  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Pl}rc"
```
This would result in the word "Pl" being returned instead of the correct plural form of the word, which would be "s".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"clouk"
```
This would result in the word "clouk" being returned instead of the correct plural form of the word, which would be "dice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"monkey"
```
This would result in the word "monkey" being returned instead of the correct plural form of the word, which would be "monkeys". DONE.
