Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.accessSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.accessSync` checks the accessibility of the file, whereas `fs.existsSync` checks the existence of the file, which might lead to different outcomes based on the file system's permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(file) { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function always returns `true`, indicating that the destination file always exists, even if it doesn't, which would lead to the file being overwritten or an error being thrown every time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.lstatSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.lstatSync` returns information about a symbolic link, whereas `fs.existsSync` checks the existence of the actual file, which could lead to incorrect results if the destination file is a symbolic link.

DONE.
