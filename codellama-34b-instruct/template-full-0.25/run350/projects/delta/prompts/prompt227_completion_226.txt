  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the component array is accessed instead of the second element, which contains the type of the diff component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the component array is accessed instead of the second element, which contains the type of the diff component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth element of the component array is accessed instead of the second element, which contains the type of the diff component.

DONE.
