  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.state` can be "pending" or "rejected", both of which would evaluate to `true` with `!== "fulfilled"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.state` can be "pending" or "fulfilled", both of which would evaluate to `true` with `!== "rejected"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.state` can be "fulfilled" or "rejected", both of which would evaluate to `true` with `!== "pending"`.

DONE.
