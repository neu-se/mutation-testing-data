  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, which is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. In this case, the `apply` method expects the first argument to be a value that will be used as the `this` context for the function being called, and `null` is a valid value that could be used as a context. However, it is not the same as `void 0`, which is a more explicit way of indicating that no value is being passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `void 0`, which is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. In this case, the `apply` method expects the first argument to be a value that will be used as the `this` context for the function being called, and `undefined` is a valid value that
