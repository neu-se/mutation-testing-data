  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.forEach(cb => cb())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callbacks for the current key, while this replacement calls all callbacks in the `cbs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callbacks in the order they were added to the `cbs` array, while this replacement calls the callbacks in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callbacks in the order they were added to the `cbs` array, while this replacement calls the callbacks in reverse order.

DONE.
