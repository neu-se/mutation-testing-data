  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'wrong_dest' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the `dest` variable, which is used to create the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to `null`, which would cause the write stream to be created with a `null` filename, rather than the expected filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'dest' + Math.random() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a random value, which would cause the write stream to be created with a different filename than the expected filename.

DONE.
