  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the "index.html" string with an empty string, while this new code fragment would remove the entire "index.html" string, potentially changing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index.php'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the "index.html" string with an empty string, while this new code fragment would replace it with "index.php", potentially changing the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the "index.html" string with an empty string, while this new code fragment would replace it with "index.html", potentially changing the URL.
