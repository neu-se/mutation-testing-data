Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the result of the `reject` function to `resolvedPromise`, which may lead to the promise being resolved with a rejection value instead of properly transitioning to a rejected state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the `resolve` method with the `reason`, which should only be used for fulfilling the promise, not rejecting it, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Q.reject(reason)` to create a new rejected promise, but it does not handle the state of `resolvedPromise` correctly, which could lead to inconsistencies in the promise's state management.

DONE.
