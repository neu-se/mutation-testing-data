  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is a regular expression, and the `+ ""` operator would convert it to a string, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the `test` variable, which would cause the test to fail if it was originally true, and pass if it was originally false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is a regular expression, and calling it with the `undefined` value would cause it to throw an error, which would likely cause the test to fail.

DONE.
