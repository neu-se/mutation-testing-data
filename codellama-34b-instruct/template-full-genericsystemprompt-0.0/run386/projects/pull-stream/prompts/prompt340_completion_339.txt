  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `value` property of the `data` object, rather than the `data` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[field]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `field` property of the `data` object, rather than the `data` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `field` function with the `data` object as an argument, rather than returning the `data` object itself.

DONE.
