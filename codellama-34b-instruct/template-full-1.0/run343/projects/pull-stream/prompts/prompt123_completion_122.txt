  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while the new code fragment also checks if `end` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while the new code fragment only checks if `end` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is falsy.

DONE.
