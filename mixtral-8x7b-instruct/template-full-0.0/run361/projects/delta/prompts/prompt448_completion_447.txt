 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next operation in the array instead of the current one, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select an operation from the array instead of using the current one, causing unpredictable behavior in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index].type
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the type property of the current operation, potentially causing incorrect behavior if other properties are required for the peekType method.

DONE.
