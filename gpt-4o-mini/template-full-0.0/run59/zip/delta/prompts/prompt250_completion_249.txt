Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation iterator (`thisIter`) instead of the other operation iterator (`otherIter`), potentially leading to incorrect operations being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add 1 to the length returned by `otherIter.peekLength`, which could cause an off-by-one error in the processing of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0 ? 1 : otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force a minimum length of 1 when `otherIter.peekLength()` is 0, which could lead to unnecessary operations being processed even when there are no operations to process.

DONE.
