  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a rejected promise with the reason as the rejection value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a resolved promise with the reason as the resolution value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a rejected promise with an Error object as the rejection value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
