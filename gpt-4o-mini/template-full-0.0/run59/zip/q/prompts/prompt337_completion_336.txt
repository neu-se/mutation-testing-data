Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the promise is still pending instead of checking if it has been rejected, which would lead to the promise being incorrectly marked as having an exception when it is still unresolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the promise to incorrectly assume it has a valid state when it is not rejected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when handling promise resolutions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the promise is fulfilled instead of rejected, which would cause the promise to incorrectly assign a value to `promise.exception` when it should not have one, leading to misleading results.

DONE.
