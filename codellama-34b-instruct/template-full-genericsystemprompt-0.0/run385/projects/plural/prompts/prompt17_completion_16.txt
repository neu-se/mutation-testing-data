  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment, which is `/x$|ch$|s$/i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns `w + 's'` instead of `w + 'es'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns `w + 'ies'` instead of `w + 'es'`.

DONE.
