  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string "module.js" is present in the line, which may not be the case in all scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string "node.js" is present in the line, which may not be the case in all scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1 &&
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string "module.js" is present in the line and if it is not, it would not check if the string "node.js" is present in the line.

DONE.
