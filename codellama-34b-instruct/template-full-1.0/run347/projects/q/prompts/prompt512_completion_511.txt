  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of `object.keys`, which may be different from the actual keys of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of `Object.keys(object)`, which is the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)`, which is the same as the original code fragment, but using a different method to get the keys.

DONE.
