Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.open
```
This would result in different behavior because the `open` method is asynchronous and returns a callback, unlike `openSync` which is synchronous and returns the file descriptor directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.openSync.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method changes the context of the `openSync` function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the function relies on its original context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(filename => this.openSync(filename, 'w'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now opens the file in write mode ('w') instead of read mode ('r'), potentially overwriting the file's contents or creating a new file if it doesn't exist.

DONE.
