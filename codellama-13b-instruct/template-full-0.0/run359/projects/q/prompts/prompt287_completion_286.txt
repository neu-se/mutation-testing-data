  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object is not defined in the original code, and would cause a reference error if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function is not defined in the original code, and would cause a reference error if used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.deferred()` function is not defined in the original code, and would cause a reference error if used.

DONE.
