  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first anchor tag in the HTML document, rather than the anchor tag with the "base" class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a:not(.base)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all anchor tags that do not have the "base" class, rather than just the anchor tag with the "base" class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href="http://example.com"]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the anchor tag with the "base" class that has an href attribute with the value "http://example.com", rather than just the anchor tag with the "base" class.

DONE.
