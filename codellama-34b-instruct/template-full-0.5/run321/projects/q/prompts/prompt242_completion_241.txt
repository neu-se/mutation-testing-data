  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `nearerValue`, which would change the result of the `nearer` function and potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `nearerValue`, which would change the result of the `nearer` function and potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `nearerValue`, which would change the result of the `nearer` function and potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

DONE.
