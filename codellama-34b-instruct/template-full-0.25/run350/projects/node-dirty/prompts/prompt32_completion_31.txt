  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the key value by 1, which could potentially cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the key value by 1, which could potentially cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the key value, which could potentially cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key.

DONE.
