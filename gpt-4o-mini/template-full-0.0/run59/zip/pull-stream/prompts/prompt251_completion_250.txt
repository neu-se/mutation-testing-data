Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `read` function instead of the `abort` value, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the callback function `cb` with an empty function, meaning that the result of the read operation would not be processed or returned, effectively ignoring the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `true` as the first argument to the `read` function instead of the `abort` value, which could lead to unintended consequences in how the stream is aborted or handled.

DONE.
