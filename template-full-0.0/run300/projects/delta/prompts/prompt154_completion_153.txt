  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the first op in the other delta is a retain with a length greater than the first left, which would result in an incorrect composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the first op in the other delta is a retain with a length greater than the first left, which would result in an incorrect composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the first op in the other delta is a retain with a length greater than or equal to the first left, which would result in an incorrect composition.

DONE.
