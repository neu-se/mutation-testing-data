  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make `delta.ops` a reference to `other.ops`, rather than a copy of it. If the `concat` method is called on `delta`, it would modify `other.ops` as well, since they are referring to the same array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other.ops` array in reverse order, rather than in its original order. This could potentially change the final result of the `delta.ops` array, depending on what the `concat` method is doing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[ ...other.ops ]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array by spreading the elements of `other.ops`, rather than making a shallow copy of the array. This could potentially change the final result of the `delta.
