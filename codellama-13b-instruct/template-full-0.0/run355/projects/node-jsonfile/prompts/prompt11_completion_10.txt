  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would be called with a string instead of a buffer, which would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would be called with a string instead of a buffer, which would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString('utf8').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would be called with a string instead of a buffer, which would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
