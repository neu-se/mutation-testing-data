Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the imaginary part `b` to using the real part `a`, which would lead to incorrect results in the complex exponential calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the imaginary part by adding 1, which would alter the output of the complex number and potentially lead to unexpected results in calculations involving the complex exponential.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the imaginary part `b` with its absolute value, which would change the sign of the imaginary component in the output, affecting the overall representation of the complex number.

DONE.
