  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a less-than-or-equal-to comparison, while this new code fragment uses a less-than comparison. This could cause the function to return a different value in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a less-than-or-equal-to comparison, while this new code fragment uses a greater-than comparison. This could cause the function to return a different value in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a less-than-or-equal-to comparison, while this new code fragment uses a not-equal comparison. This could cause the function to return a different value in certain cases.

DONE.
