Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly subtracts `a` from `r` instead of adding it, which could lead to incorrect calculations for the imaginary part of the square root when `a` is positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the square root of `r` instead of the original expression, which would not correctly account for the relationship between `a` and `b` in the context of complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `b` instead of `a`, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the denominator, affecting the result of the square root for complex numbers.

DONE.
