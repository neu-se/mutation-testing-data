 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with a null value instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause issues if the consuming code expects the promise to be rejected in case of a timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject('Timeout')
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected with a string 'Timeout' instead of rejecting with an Error object. This could cause issues if the consuming code expects a specific Error object or error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with the error object instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause issues if the consuming code expects the promise to be rejected in case of a timeout and doesn't handle resolved promises with error objects.

DONE.
