Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` will convert the string into an array based on commas, which is not the intended behavior of matching numeric patterns in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.search(/\d+/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match instead of an array of all matches, which would lead to incorrect parsing of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.replace(/\D/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` will remove all non-digit characters from the string, resulting in a string of digits rather than an array of tokens, which would disrupt the parsing logic.

DONE.
