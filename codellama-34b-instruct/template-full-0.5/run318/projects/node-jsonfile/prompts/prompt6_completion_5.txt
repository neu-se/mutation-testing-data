  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` returns a promise that resolves with the result of the function, whereas `universalify.fromCallback` returns a function that takes a callback as its last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` returns a function that takes a callback as its last argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a promise that resolves with the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` returns a function that takes a callback as its last argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a promise that
