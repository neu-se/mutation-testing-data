  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `pendingCount` is greater than 0, the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line would never be reached, causing the promise to never resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `pendingCount` is less than or equal to 0, the `deferred.reject(promises)` line would always be reached, causing the promise to always reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the length of `promises` is 0, the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line would never be reached,
