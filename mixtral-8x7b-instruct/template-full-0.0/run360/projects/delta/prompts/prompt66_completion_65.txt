 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert an operation, even if the length is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only insert an operation when the length is exactly 0, instead of when it is less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only insert an operation when the length is greater than 1, instead of when it is less than or equal to 0.

DONE.
