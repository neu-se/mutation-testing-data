  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete();
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.delete()` would delete the entire document, whereas `retDelta.push()` would only push the operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.compose(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.compose()` would compose the operations in the delta with the operations in the other delta, whereas `retDelta.push()` would only push the operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push()` would push the operation to the delta, whereas `retDelta.push()` would only push the operation to the delta.

DONE.
