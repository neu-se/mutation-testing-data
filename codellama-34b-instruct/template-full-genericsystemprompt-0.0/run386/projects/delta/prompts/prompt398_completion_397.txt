  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a boolean value that indicates whether the operation is a delete operation, whereas `otherOp` is an object that contains information about the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a number that indicates the length of the operation, whereas `otherOp` is an object that contains information about the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is an object that contains attributes for the operation, whereas `otherOp` is an object that contains information about the operation.

DONE.
