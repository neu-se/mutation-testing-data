  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because `!p` is negating the value of `p`, whereas `!!p` is converting the value of `p` to a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `p && true` is always true if `p` is truthy, whereas `!!p` is always true if `p` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `p || false` is always false if `p` is falsy, whereas `!!p` is always false if `p` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
