  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `otherIter.peekLength()` without an argument, which would return the length of the next operation in the iterator. Passing an argument of `1` would modify the behavior to return the length of the next `1` operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekType());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `otherIter.peekLength()` without an argument, which would return the length of the next operation in the iterator. Passing an argument of `otherIter.peekType()` would modify the behavior to return the length of the next operation in the iterator with the same type as the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekType(), otherIter.peekFormat());
```
This would
