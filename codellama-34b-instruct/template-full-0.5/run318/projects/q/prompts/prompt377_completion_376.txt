  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newValue` is a reference to the `value` parameter passed to the `_progressed` function, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newValue` is a reference to the `value` parameter passed to the `_progressed` function, while `undefined` is an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newValue` is a reference to the `value` parameter passed to the `_progressed` function, while `"hello"` is a string value.

DONE.
