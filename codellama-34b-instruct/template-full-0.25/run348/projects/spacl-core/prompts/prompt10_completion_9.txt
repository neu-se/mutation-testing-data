      ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/
      : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) === null
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

      : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is replaced with `!
