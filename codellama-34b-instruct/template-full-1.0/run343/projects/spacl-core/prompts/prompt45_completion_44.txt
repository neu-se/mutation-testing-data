  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:./) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches if the first character after the colon is any character, instead of matching if there is at least one character after the colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.*/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches if there is any character after the colon, including no characters at all, instead of matching if there is at least one character after the colon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:\w+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches if the first character after the colon is a word character, instead of matching if there is at least one character after the colon.

DONE.
