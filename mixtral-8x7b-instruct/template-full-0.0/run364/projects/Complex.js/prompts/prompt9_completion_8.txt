 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(x) * Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential of both x and -x separately, which may not produce the same result as the original code fragment that uses `Math.exp(x)` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0.5 * (Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the average of `Math.exp(x)` and `Math.exp(-x)`, which is not the same as the original code fragment that calculates the product of `Math.exp(x)` and `Math.exp(-x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(Math.E, x) * Math.pow(Math.E, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential
