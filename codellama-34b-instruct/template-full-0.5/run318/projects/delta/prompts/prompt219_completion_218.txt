  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the comparison operator, causing the `invert` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops === other.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the operations in the `other` delta, causing the `invert` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the operations in the two deltas, rather than the operations themselves, causing the `invert` method to return a different result.

DONE.
