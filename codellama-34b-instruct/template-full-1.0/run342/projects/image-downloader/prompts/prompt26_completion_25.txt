  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mutated(options);
```
This would result in different behavior because `mutated` is a different function from `request`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of `image` is when it calls a function with a different name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.mutate(options);
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.mutate` is a different method from `request`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of `image` is when it calls a method with a different name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request(options).mutate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `request(options)` is a different value from `request`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of `image` is when it calls a function with a different argument.

DONE.
