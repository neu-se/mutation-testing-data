  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `_load` method, which is not defined in the code snippet provided. By replacing it with an empty function, the code would no longer call the `_load` method, which could cause the tests to fail if they rely on the `_load` method being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = function () { throw new Error('test error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error. By replacing it with a function that throws an error, the code would now throw an error when the `_load` method is called, which could cause the tests to fail if they do not handle errors correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = function () { return Math.random(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return a random value. By replacing it
