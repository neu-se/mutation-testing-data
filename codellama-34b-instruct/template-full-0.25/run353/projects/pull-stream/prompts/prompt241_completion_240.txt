  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `0` is a numeric value that may not be equivalent to the value of `data`.

DONE.
