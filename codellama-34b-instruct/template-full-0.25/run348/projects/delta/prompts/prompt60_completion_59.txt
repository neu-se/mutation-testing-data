  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'object' && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the argument is an object instead of a string, and it would also check if the length of the argument is equal to 0, which is not the same as checking if the argument is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the argument is a string and its length is greater than 0, which is not the same as checking if the argument is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the argument is a string and its length is equal to 1, which is not the same as checking if the argument is an empty string.

DONE.
