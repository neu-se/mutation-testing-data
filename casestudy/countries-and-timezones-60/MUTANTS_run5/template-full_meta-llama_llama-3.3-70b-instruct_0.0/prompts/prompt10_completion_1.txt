Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset / 120
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code divides the offset by 60 to calculate the hours, but the replacement code divides it by 120, which would result in incorrect hour calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor` to round down to the nearest whole number, but the replacement code uses `Math.ceil` to round up, which would result in different hour calculations for offsets that are not exact multiples of 60.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(utcOffset) / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `offset` variable, but the replacement code uses the `utcOffset` variable, which might have a different value, especially if the `dstOffset` is being calculated, resulting in incorrect hour calculations.

DONE.
