  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the code to skip over the first operation in the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the code to read one more operation from the `otherIter` iterator than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the `ops` property of the `otherIter` iterator, which would give it the length of the iterator, rather than the length of the `other` delta object.

DONE.
