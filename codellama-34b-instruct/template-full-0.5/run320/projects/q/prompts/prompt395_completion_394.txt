  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the original function, whereas the original code simply calls the `then` method on the `this` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `then` method on the `this` object with the `this` context of the original function, whereas the original code simply calls the `then` method on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `then` method on the `this` object with the `this` context of the original function, whereas the original code simply calls the `then` method on the `this` object.

DONE.
