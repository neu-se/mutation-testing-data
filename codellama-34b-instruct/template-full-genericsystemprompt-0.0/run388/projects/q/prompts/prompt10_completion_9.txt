  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a function that takes no arguments, whereas the original code defines a function that takes a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function(require) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a function that takes a single argument named "require", whereas the original code defines a function that takes no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function(require, exports, module) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a function that takes three arguments named "require", "exports", and "module", whereas the original code defines a function that takes no arguments.

DONE.
