  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality. This means that the new code fragment would not enter the `if` block if `fn(key, val)` returns `false`, even if `fn(key, val)` is a function that returns `false` for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for equality. This means that the new code fragment would enter the `if` block if `fn(key, val)` returns `true`, even if `fn(key, val)` is a function that returns `false` for some inputs.
