 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else once(end)` statement will no longer guarantee that `once` function is called with the correct `end` parameter. If `end` is falsy but not `undefined`, the `once` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function will be called with `null` as the `end` parameter, which might not be expected in the rest of the code. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the code assumes `end` to be a boolean or a specific falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function will be called with the `cb` function as the `end` parameter, which is not the same as the original `end` value. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the `once
