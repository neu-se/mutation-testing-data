  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to true, causing the code to always take the first branch of the if statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to false, causing the code to always take the else branch of the if statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to true or false depending on the values of a and b, causing the code to take either the first or second branch of the if statement.

DONE.
