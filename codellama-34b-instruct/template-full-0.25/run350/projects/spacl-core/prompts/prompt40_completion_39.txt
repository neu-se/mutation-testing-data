  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the `spec` string into an array of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the `spec` string into an array of substrings using the regular expression `/\//` as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the `spec` string into an array
