  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `insert` property of the `lastOp` object is not null, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `insert` property of the `lastOp` object is not undefined, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `insert` property of the `lastOp` object is not a string, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is not an object.

DONE.
