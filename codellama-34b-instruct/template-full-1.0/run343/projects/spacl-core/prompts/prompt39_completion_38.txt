  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is expected to split the `spec` string by `/` and then slice the resulting array, but with `2` as the argument, the `parts` array would be empty, causing the `finalise` function to return an incorrect regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.map(Number)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would convert the `spec` string to an array of numbers, but the `compile` function is expecting an array of strings, causing the `finalise` function to return an incorrect regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.split(/\s+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the `spec` string by whitespace, but the `compile` function is expecting a `/` character, causing the `finalise` function
