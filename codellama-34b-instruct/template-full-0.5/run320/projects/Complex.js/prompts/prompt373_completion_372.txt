  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different values at different points in the complex plane, so the resulting complex number would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the result of `Math.cos` would invert the sign of the real part of the complex number, causing the `asinh` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` and `Math.asin` have different values at different points in the complex plane, so the resulting complex number would be different.

DONE.
