  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be replaced with `undefined`, which is a different type of value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be replaced with the number `0`, which is a different type of value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be replaced with an empty string, which is a different type of value.

DONE.
