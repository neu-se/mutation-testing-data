 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would return an object with `null` values for `re` and `im`, instead of using the provided arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would return an object with empty objects for `re` and `im`, instead of using the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Complex()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would call itself recursively without any arguments, causing a stack overflow or an error due to missing arguments.

DONE.
