  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice[2] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would be called on the second element of the `args` array instead of the original array.
```
{
    let PLACEHOLDER = '<PLACEHOLDER>'
    PLACEHOLDER = array_slice[2] = 0;;
    return PLACEHOLDER;
}
```
This will return 0 as an integer instead of the array that the original code expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice[2] = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would be called on the second element of the `args` array instead of the original array.
```
{
    let PLACEHOLDER = '<PLACEHOLDER>'
    PLACEHOLDER = array_slice[2] = "foo";;
    return PLACEHOLDER;
