  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
