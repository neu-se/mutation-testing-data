  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the base URL as the second argument to the `parse` function, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current URL as the first argument to the `parse` function, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `parse` function, which would cause an error.

DONE.
