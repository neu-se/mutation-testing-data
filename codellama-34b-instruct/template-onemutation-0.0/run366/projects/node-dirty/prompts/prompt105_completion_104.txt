  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value of the `val` property of the `row` object, while `row.key` is the value of the `key` property of the `row` object. Using `row.val` instead of `row.key` would cause the code to use the wrong key to retrieve the value from the `_data` map, leading to unexpected behavior.
