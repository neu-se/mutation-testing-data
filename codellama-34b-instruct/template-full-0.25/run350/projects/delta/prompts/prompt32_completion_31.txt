  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the base object instead of the attribute object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attribute object instead of the base object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the b object instead of the attribute object.

DONE.
