  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the comma operator, so the expression `read + 1` would be evaluated first, and the result would be a number, not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would be called on the `read` function, which would return a string representation of the function, not the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.call(null, read)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method would be called on the `read` function with a `null` context and the `read` function as an argument, which would result in a different execution context and potentially different behavior.

DONE.
