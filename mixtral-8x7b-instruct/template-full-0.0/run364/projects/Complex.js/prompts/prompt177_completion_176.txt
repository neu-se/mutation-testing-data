 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the divisor's real part instead of the dividend's real part in the calculation when the divisor is not purely imaginary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat the divisor as real, even when it has an imaginary part, leading to incorrect results or exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c / d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division operation that could lead to division by zero or incorrect results when the divisor is zero or infinity.

DONE.
