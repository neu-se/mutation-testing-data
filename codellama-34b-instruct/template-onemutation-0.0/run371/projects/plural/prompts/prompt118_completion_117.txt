  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the plural rule to words that end in "ics" if the word is not already plural, but the new code fragment would always add "s" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is already plural or not.
