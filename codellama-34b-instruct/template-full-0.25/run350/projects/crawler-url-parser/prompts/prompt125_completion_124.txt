  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the operands. In this case, `linkurl` is a string, so the condition would always be false, even if `linkurl` contains the string "string".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length === 6
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string. In this case, the condition would be true only if `linkurl` contains the string "string" and has a length of 6 characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.includes("string")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if a string contains a specific substring. In this case, the condition would be true if `linkurl` contains the substring "string", regardless of its length.

DONE.
