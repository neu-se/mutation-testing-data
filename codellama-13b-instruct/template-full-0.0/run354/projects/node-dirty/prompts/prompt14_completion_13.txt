  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the callback function to the end of the callbacks array, while this code fragment pushes the callback function to the beginning of the array. This could cause the callbacks to be executed in a different order, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the callback function to the end of the callbacks array, while this code fragment pushes the callback function to the beginning of the array. This could cause the callbacks to be executed in a different order, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.splice(0, 0, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the callback function to the end of the callbacks array, while
