This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of invoking an empty object, which is always `undefined`. The original code returns the `state` property of the `inspect()` method's result, which is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1 instead of the `state` property of the `inspect()` method's result. This change would make the function non-
