  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round()` and `Math.ceil()` have different rounding mechanics.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc()` and `Math.ceil()` have different rounding mechanics.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` and `Math.ceil()` have different rounding mechanics.

DONE.
