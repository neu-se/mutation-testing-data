  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the `pow` method to return a different result than the original code, as the `Math.cos` function has a different behavior than `Math.sin`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will also cause the `pow` method to return a different result than the original code, as the `Math.tan` function has a different behavior than `Math.sin`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This change will cause the `pow` method to return a different result than the original code, as the `Math.asin` function has a different behavior than `Math.sin`.

DONE.
