  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional from "not" to "contains".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text !== text
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional from "includes" to "not equals".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tmpUrl.text.startsWith(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional from "includes" to "starts with" and negates the result.

DONE.
