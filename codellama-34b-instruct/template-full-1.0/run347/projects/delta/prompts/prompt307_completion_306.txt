  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.undo())
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator and `otherIter.undo()` moves the iterator to the previous position, which would cause the loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(-1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator by a positive number and `otherIter.next(-1)` moves the iterator backwards by a negative number, which would cause the loop to never terminate.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(0))
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator by a positive number and `otherIter.next(0)` does not move the iterator at all, which would cause the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
