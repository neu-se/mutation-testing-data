  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first two arguments of the `fcall` method to the `apply` method, instead of passing all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `fcall` method to the `apply` method, instead of passing all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, arguments.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments of the `fcall` method to the `apply` method, except for the first argument.

DONE.
