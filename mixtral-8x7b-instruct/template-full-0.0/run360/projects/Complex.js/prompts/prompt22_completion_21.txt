 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * 1 + 1 * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the calculation with a constant value, which would not consider the input values `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the powers, which may have different behavior compared to the original code using the multiplication operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
hypot(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `hypot` function, which calculates the square root of the sum of squares of `a` and `b` using a different approach. The `hypot` function also has a check for large input values, which is not present in the original code.
