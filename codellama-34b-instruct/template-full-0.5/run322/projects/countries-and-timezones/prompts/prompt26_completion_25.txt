  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `dstOffset` by 1, potentially causing the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `dstOffset` by a factor of 2, potentially causing the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `dstOffset` by -1, potentially causing the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string.

DONE.
