  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first character of the line and start at the second character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start at the second line instead of the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start at the third line instead of the first line.

DONE.
