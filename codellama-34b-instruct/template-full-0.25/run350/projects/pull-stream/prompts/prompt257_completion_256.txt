  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `err` is truthy and has a `message` property, whereas the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy in general.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is falsy or has a `message` property, whereas the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy in general.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err || err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is falsy or has a `message` property, whereas the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy in general.

DONE.
