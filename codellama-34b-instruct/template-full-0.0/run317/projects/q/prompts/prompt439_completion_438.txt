  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` handler to the promise that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` handler to the promise that returns a rejected promise with the reason "test".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.resolve("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` handler to the promise that returns a resolved promise with the value "test".

DONE.
