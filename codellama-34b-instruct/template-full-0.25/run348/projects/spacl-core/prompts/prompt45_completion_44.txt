  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if the pattern is not found in the string, so the original code fragment would return `true` if the pattern is not found, while the new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `undefined` if the pattern is not found in the string, so the original code fragment would return `true` if the pattern is not found, while the new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== null && part.match(/:.+/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if the pattern is not found in the string, and `undefined` if the pattern is not
