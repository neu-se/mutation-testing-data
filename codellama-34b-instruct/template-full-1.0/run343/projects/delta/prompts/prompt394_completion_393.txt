  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the Delta object would be one less than the original, which could cause the iterator to skip the last element and return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the Delta object would be one more than the original, which could cause the iterator to attempt to access an element that does not exist and return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would always return the first element of the Delta object, regardless of the value of `otherOp.delete` or `priority`.

DONE.
