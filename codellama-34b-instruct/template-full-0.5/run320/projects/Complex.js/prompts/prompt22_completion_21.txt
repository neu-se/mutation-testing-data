  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, without squaring them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, without adding them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, without squaring them.

DONE.
