  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, so replacing `rejected` with `resolved` would prevent `done` from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, so passing an error object as the first argument would cause `done` to be called with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, so resolving the deferred promise would prevent `done` from being called.

DONE.
