  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` and `args` variables, while the buggy code fragment is using the `value` and `args` variables. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variables are used in a different way in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` and `args` variables, while the buggy code fragment is using the `value` and `args` variables.
