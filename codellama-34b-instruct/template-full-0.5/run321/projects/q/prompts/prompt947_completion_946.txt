  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred, deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` function is not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
