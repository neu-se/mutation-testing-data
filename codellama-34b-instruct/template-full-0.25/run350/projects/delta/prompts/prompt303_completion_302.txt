  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one step, potentially skipping over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by two steps, potentially skipping over multiple operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the next operation, potentially skipping over multiple operations.

DONE.
