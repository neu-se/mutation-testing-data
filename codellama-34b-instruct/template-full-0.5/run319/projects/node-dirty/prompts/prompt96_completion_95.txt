  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the key `key` is in the object `row`, while `row.key === undefined` checks if the value associated with the key `key` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key !== 'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the key `key` is in the object `row`, while `row.key !== 'key'` checks if the value associated with the key `key` is not the string `'key'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(row, 'key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the key `key` is in the object `row`, while `!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(row
