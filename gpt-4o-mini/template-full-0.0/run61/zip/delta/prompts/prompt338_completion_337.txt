Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next operation in the base slice, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations that follow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access an invalid index in the base slice, which could lead to an error or unexpected results when trying to retrieve the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the base index forward by the length of the current operation, which could cause the wrong operations to be processed or skipped entirely.

DONE.
