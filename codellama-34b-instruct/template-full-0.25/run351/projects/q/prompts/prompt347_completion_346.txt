  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` can be a function or any other value, and `undefined` is a specific value that is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string representing the type of the operand, and `undefined` is a specific value that is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a specific value that is not a function, and `rejected` can be a function or any other value.

DONE.
