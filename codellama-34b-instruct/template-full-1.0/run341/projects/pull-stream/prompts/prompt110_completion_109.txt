  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var acc = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` is a variable that is assigned a value of `0` in this snippet, but the original code fragment uses the `acc` variable from the parameter of the `reduce` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign before `acc` makes the expression evaluate to a negative value, whereas the original code fragment does not use any arithmetic operations on `acc`.
