  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses at the end of the `chop` method, which would have caused the method to not be called and the resulting `Delta` object to not be chopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the argument `1` in the `chop` method, which would have caused the method to not chop the `Delta` object at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the argument `2` in the `chop` method, which would have caused the method to chop the `Delta` object at a different position.

DONE.
