  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `diff` method of the `AttributeMap` class to compare the attributes of the two operations, instead of using the `invert` method as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(otherOp.attributes, thisOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `invert` method of the `AttributeMap` class to invert the attributes of the second operation, instead of using the `diff` method as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `compose` method of the `AttributeMap` class to combine the attributes of the two operations, instead of using the `diff` method as in the original code
