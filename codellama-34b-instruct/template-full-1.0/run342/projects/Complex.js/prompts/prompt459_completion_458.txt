  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'isInfinite' => function() { return 0; },
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `0`, regardless of the actual value of the complex number, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'isInfinite' => function() { return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite'](0, 0)); },
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if the complex number is infinite, but the second argument to `isFinite` is `0`, which is not the same as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'isInfinite' => function() { return this['isNaN'](0, 0); },
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if the complex number is infinite, but the `isNaN` function expects the first argument to be a number
