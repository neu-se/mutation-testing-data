  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but replacing it with `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but replacing it with an empty function would cause the `runSingle` function to do nothing.

DONE.
