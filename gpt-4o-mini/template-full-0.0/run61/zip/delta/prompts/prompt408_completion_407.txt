Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `delta` object directly without calling the `chop` method, which may lead to the return of an unmodified `delta` instead of a processed version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.slice();
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a shallow copy of the `delta` object instead of the processed version, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent operations that rely on the modified state of `delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.push({}); 
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty object to the `delta`, altering its contents and potentially affecting any logic that depends on the structure or length of the `delta` object.

DONE.
