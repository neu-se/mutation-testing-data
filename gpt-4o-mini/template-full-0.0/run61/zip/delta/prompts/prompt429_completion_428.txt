Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current index instead of the length of the next operation, potentially allowing the iterator to incorrectly determine if there are more operations to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0`, causing `hasNext()` to incorrectly indicate that there are no more operations available, regardless of the actual state of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the current index to the total number of operations instead of the length of the next operation, leading to incorrect results when determining if there are more operations to process.

DONE.
