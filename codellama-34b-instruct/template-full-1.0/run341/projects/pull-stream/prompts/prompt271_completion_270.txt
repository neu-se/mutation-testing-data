  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `stream` variable instead of the `values` variable, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `stream` variable as an argument to the `values` function instead of returning it, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate an error because `stream` is not a function and cannot be called.

DONE.
