  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as a string, while the modified code fragment uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the `text` variable to uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as a string, while the modified code fragment uses the `length` property to get the length of the `text` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split(' ').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as a string, while the modified code fragment uses the `split()` method to split the `text` variable into an array of words, and then uses the `join()` method to join the array of words into a single string with no spaces.

DONE.
