  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 0
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out empty strings from the array, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 1
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out strings with length 1 or less, while the new code fragment filters out strings with length 0 or less.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 2
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out strings with length 1 or less, while the new code fragment filters out strings
