  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match carriage returns instead of line feeds, which could cause issues if the input string contains carriage returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n{2,}/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match two or more consecutive line feeds instead of a single line feed, which could cause issues if the input string contains multiple consecutive line feeds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match both carriage returns and line feeds, which could cause issues if the input string contains a mix of both.

DONE.
