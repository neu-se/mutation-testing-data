  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the reason, instead of returning a promise that is resolved with the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the reason, instead of returning a promise that is rejected with the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the reason, instead of returning a promise that is rejected with the reason.

DONE.
