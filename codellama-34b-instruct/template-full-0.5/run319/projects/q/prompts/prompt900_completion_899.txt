  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeRejector` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise.

DONE.
