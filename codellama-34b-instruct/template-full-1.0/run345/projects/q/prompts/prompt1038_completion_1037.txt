  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a promise that is never resolved or rejected, while `Q.defer()` returns a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise with the reason `'Can't get value from closed queue'`, while `Q.defer()` returns a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array resolves or rejects, while `Q.defer()` returns a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
