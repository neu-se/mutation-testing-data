  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `null` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which would likely cause an error when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `nodeArgs` array, which could potentially break the functionality of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `nodeArgs` array, which could potentially break the functionality of the function.

DONE.
