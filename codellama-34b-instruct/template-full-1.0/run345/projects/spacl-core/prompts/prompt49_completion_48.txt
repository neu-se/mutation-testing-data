  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is now capturing the first two characters of the part string, whereas the original code captured only the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is now capturing a different substring of the part string, whereas the original code captured only the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.charAt(0) + part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now concatenating the first character of the part string with the remainder of the string, whereas the original code captured only the first character.

DONE.
