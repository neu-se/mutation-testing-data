  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns `undefined`, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns `undefined`, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise. Additionally, `fs.writeFileSync` takes three arguments, whereas `fs.writeFile` takes four arguments.

DONE.
