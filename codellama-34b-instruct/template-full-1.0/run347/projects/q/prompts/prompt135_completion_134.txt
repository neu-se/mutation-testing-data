  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"[object StopIteration]" => "[object QReturnValue]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "[object QReturnValue]" is not the same as "[object StopIteration]", which would prevent the code from recognizing the StopIteration exception and properly terminating the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof QReturnValue => false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting the exception to be an instance of the QReturnValue class, but by returning `false`, it would always return `false`, even if the exception is an instance of QReturnValue, causing the code to throw the exception and terminate the iteration instead of properly terminating the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var QReturnValue = function () {return;}
```
This would result in different behavior because the QReturnValue function would return an empty object instead of the expected value, causing the code to throw an error and terminate the iteration instead of
