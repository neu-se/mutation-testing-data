  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are inverse operations, so if the original code used `delete`, replacing it with `insert` would result in the opposite behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are inverse operations, so if the original code used `delete`, replacing it with `retain` would result in the opposite behavior. Additionally, `retain` takes a length argument, which is not present in the original code, so this change would also result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op), {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are inverse operations, so if the original code used `delete`, replacing it with `retain` would
