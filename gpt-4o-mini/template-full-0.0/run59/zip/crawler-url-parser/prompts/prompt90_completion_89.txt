Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href == null || href.length < 5 || /^(mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for `null` instead of `undefined`, increases the minimum length requirement from 3 to 5, and removes the `javascript` protocol from the check, allowing more URLs to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href !== "string" || href.length <= 3 || /^(javascript|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `!==` instead of `==`, which changes the type checking logic, and it allows `href` of length exactly 3 to pass through, while also excluding `mailto:` from the check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|http:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for `typeof href`, meaning any falsy value (like `null`
