  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an iterator over the keys in the map, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, rather than just the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values.filter(value => value.type === 'internal')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the values that pass the specified filter function, rather than all the values in the map.

DONE.
