  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, regardless of the input string, which would cause the `parse` function to return `null` for any input that contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !_has_illegal_chars(str);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if the input string does not contain any illegal characters, and `false` otherwise. This would cause the `parse` function to return `null` for any input that does not contain any illegal characters, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str);
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is negated, which
