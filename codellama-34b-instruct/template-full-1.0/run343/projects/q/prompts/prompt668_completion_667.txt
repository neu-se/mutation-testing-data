  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["dispatch"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called as a property of the `Q(object)` result, rather than as a method of the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called as a static method of the `Q` object, rather than as an instance method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object, "post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with a different set of arguments, resulting in a different behavior.

DONE.
