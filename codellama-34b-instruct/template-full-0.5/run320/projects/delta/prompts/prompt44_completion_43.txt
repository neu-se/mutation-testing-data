  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this new fragment checks if `a` is not an object and not null. If `a` is null, the original fragment would return true, but the new fragment would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' || a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this new fragment checks if `a` is not an object or undefined. If `a` is undefined, the original fragment would return false, but the new fragment would return true.
