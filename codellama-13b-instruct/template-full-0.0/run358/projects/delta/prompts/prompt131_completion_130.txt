  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of an array, while the `push` method adds an element to the end of an array. In this context, using `unshift` would cause the new operation to be added to the beginning of the array, rather than the end, which could affect the order in which operations are applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method adds an element to an array at a specific index, while the `push` method adds an element to the end of an array. In this context, using `splice` would cause the new operation to be added to the beginning of the array, rather than the end, which could affect the order in which operations are applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.concat(newOp)
```
