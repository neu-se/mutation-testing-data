  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` in the original code fragment is used as a key to retrieve the `fallback` method from the `object` argument. By adding 1 to `op`, the returned value would be a different method, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` in the original code fragment is used as a key to retrieve the `fallback` method from the `object` argument. By subtracting 1 from `op`, the returned value would be a different method, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` in the original code fragment is used as a key to retrieve the `fallback` method from the `object` argument. By multiplying `op` by 2, the returned value would be a different
