 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'href' attribute of the 'body' element, which is not a collection, unlike the 'a' elements selected by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('a')[0].attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it only accesses the 'href' attribute of the first 'a' element, whereas the original code processes all 'a' elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('a').eq(0).attr('data-href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'data-href' attribute of the first 'a' element, which might not exist, and the original code accesses the 'href' attribute.

DONE.
