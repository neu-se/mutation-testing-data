  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1` and `point2` are different points, and using `point1.latitude` instead of `point2.longitude` would change the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because this calculation would add 180 degrees to the longitude of `point1`, which would change the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude + point2.longitude) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because this calculation would calculate the average of the longitudes of `point1` and `point2`, which would change the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
