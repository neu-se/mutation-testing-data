  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the hash and any characters after it from the URL, whereas the original code fragment only removes the hash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "http://" protocol to the URL if it doesn't have one, whereas the original code fragment only adds the protocol if the URL starts with "//".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http://" protocol from the URL if it has one, whereas the original code fragment only removes the protocol if the URL starts with "//".

DONE.
