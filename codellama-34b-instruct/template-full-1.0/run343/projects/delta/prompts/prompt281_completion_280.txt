  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code,
 the peeked length is the number of characters remaining in the current op's
  target, but in the mutated code, the peeked length is decremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code,
the typeof operator is checking if the otherOp's retain attribute is an object,
while in the mutated code, the typeof operator is checking if the otherOp's retain
attribute is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
transformedData
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code,
the transformedData attribute is being assigned to the result of the
iter.next() method, which returns the next op in the iteration.
In the mutated code, the transformedData attribute is
not assigned to
