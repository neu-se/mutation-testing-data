  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        (priority || otherIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to always retain the `otherOp` when both `thisOp` and `otherOp` are inserts, regardless of the `priority` flag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        (priority || otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete')
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to always retain the `otherOp` when `thisOp` is an insert and `otherOp` is not a delete, regardless of the `priority` flag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        (priority || otherIter.peekType() === 'retain')
```
This change will cause the `transform` method
