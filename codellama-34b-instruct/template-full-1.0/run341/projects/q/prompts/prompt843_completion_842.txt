  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- return Q(object).timeout(<PLACEHOLDER>, error);
+ return Q(object).timeout(500, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout value would be 500 milliseconds instead of the original value, which may cause the promise to be rejected earlier or later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- return Q(object).timeout(<PLACEHOLDER>, error);
+ return Q(object).timeout("500", error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `500` value would be treated as a string instead of a number, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- return Q(object).timeout(<PLACEHOLDER>, error);
+ return Q(object).timeout(undefined, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value
