  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `post`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a bound function, which would change the value of `this` inside the function.

DONE.
