 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new empty Delta object instead of using the current line, potentially affecting the iteration and processing of the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the line to null, which might cause issues when the `length()` method is called on it, or when it is passed to the `predicate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the line to the current Delta's operations array, which is not a Delta object and may not have the same methods or properties as a Delta object. This could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
