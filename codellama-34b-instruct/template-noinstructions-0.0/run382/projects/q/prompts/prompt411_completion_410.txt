  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value, regardless of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.inspect().value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise, but only if it is fulfilled. If the promise is rejected, it would return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.inspect().reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason for the rejection, but only if the promise is rejected. If the promise is fulfilled, it would return undefined.

DONE.
