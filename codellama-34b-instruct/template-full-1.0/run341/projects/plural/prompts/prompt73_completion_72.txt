  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celo', 'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects the word "cello" to be pluralized to "cellos", but if it is replaced with "celo" it will be pluralized to "celloes" which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'violino'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects the word "cello" to be pluralized to "cellos", but if it is replaced with "violino" it will be pluralized to "violinos" which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'youtube', 'youtubes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects the word "youtube" to be pluralized to "youtubes", but if it is replaced with "youtube" it will not be pluralized at all.

DONE.
