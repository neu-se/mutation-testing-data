  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'foo' would be appended to the timezone name, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the integer 1 would be added to the timezone name, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bar' + tzName
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'bar' would be prepended to the timezone name, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

DONE.
