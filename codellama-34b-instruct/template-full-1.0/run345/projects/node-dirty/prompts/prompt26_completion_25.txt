  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the `_data` map, rather than setting it to `undefined` as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the key `key` to `null`, rather than `undefined` as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the key `key` to an empty object, rather than `undefined` as the original code does.

DONE.
