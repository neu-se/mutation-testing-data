 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the entire stream has finished, while `close` is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'finish'
