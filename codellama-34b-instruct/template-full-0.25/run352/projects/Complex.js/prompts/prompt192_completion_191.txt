  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `c` is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `this.b` is a property of the current object.

DONE.
