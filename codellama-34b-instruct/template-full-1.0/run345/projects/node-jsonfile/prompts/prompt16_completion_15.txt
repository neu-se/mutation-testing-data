  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFileAsync` is a different function that has a different implementation and may not handle errors in the same way as `_readFile`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_readFile` and may not handle errors in the same way as the asynchronous version.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty async function would not handle errors in the same way as `_readFile` or `_readFileSync`.

DONE.
