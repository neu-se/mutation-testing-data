  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending()` returns `true` if the promise is pending, whereas `isPromise()` returns `true` if the value is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` returns an object with information about the promise, and `state` is a property of that object that indicates the current state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled()` returns `true` if the promise is fulfilled, whereas `isPromise()` returns `true` if the value is a promise.

DONE.
