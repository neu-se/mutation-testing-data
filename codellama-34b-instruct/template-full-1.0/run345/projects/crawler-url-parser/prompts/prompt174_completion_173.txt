  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(gettype(link, page));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would be called with the arguments reversed, which would cause it to return a different value and potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(parse(url));
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` would be called with a different argument than what is typically passed to it, which could cause it to return a different value and potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(getlevel(link, page));
```
This would result in different behavior because `getlevel` would be called with the arguments reversed, which could cause it to return a different value and potentially cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
