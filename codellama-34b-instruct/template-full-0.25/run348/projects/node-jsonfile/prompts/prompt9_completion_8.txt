  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.slice(1)` would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas `data` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.concat([])` would return a new array with the original array concatenated with an empty array, whereas `data` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.map(x => x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.map(x => x + 1)` would return a new array with each element incremented by 1, whereas `data` would return the original array.

DONE.
