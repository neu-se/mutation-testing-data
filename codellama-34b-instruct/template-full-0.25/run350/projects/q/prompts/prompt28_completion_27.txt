  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error if it tries to access the `domain` property of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null, domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error if it tries to access the `domain` property of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function() {}` value would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error if it tries to call the `domain` function.

DONE.
