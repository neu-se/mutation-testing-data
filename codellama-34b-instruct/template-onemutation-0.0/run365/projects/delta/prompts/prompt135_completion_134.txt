  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, while `otherIter.peek()` is a function call that returns the value returned by the function. In this case, the function `otherIter.peek` is not defined, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when it is called.

DONE.
