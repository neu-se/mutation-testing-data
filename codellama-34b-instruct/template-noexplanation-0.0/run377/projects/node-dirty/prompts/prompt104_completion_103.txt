  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This change will cause the `update` method to delete the key from the database instead of updating it, which will likely cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This change will cause the `update` method to clear the entire database instead of updating a single key, which will likely cause significant issues in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This change will cause the `update` method to set the value of the key to `undefined` instead of the updated value, which will likely cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
