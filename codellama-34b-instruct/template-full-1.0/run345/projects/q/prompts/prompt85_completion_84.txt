  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setTimeout(flush, 0);
    requestPortTick();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to execute twice. Once with `setTimeout(flush, 0)` and second time with `requestPortTick()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    if (typeof process !== 'undefined') {
        process.once('async', flush);
    }
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only invoke `flush` function asynchronously but not immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setTimeout(flush, 1);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because  it would invoke `flush` function with a delay of 1 millisecond, instead of immediately.

DONE.
