Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to treat the `data` variable as an error condition, potentially leading to incorrect handling of valid data and causing the stream to terminate prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, meaning that the error handling logic would never be executed, and valid data would always be passed to the callback, ignoring any actual errors that may occur.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to treat `null` as a valid error condition, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the stream processing, as it would not differentiate between a legitimate error and a valid data response.

DONE.
