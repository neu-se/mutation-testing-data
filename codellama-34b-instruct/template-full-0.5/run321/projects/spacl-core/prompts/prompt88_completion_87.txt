  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` will only return policies that have a truthy `name` property, while `map` will return all policies regardless of their `name` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` will return an array of policy names, while `filter` will return an array of policies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => acc.concat(policy.name), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` will return a flattened array of policy names, while `map` and `filter` will return an array of policies.

DONE.
