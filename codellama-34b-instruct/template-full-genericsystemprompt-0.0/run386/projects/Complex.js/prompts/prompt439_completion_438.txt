  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use division instead of multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part and division instead of the real part and multiplication.

DONE.
