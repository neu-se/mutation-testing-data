  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(-1)**(minus & 1) * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `%` operator, which performs a modulo operation and returns the remainder of the division, while the new code uses the `&` operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation and returns the bitwise AND of the two operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus / 2) * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `%` operator, which performs a modulo operation and returns the remainder of the division, while the new code uses the `/` operator, which performs a division and returns the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus | 1) * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `%` operator, which performs a modulo operation and returns the remainder of the division, while the new code uses the `|` operator, which performs a bitwise OR
