  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the `op` and `index` arguments, which would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the `ops` array and call the `predicate` function with each element and its index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op => predicate(op, index)` function would be called with the `op` argument, which would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the `ops` array and call the `predicate` function with each element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `() => predicate(op, index)` function would be called with no arguments, which would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the `ops` array and call the `
