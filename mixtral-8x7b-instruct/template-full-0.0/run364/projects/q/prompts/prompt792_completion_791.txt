 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects exactly two arguments, `fulfilled` and `rejected`, but with this change, an additional function is passed, which would cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `then` method would refer to the promise object itself, rather than the `rejected` function, causing the rejection not to be handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promised.then
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the `rejected` function, the `then` method of another promise is passed, which would cause unexpected behavior and might lead to unhandled rejections.

DONE.
