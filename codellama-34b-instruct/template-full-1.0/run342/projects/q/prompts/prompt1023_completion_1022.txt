  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a constructor and `{}` is an empty object, which is not a valid argument for `Q`. The original code fragment `Q(object)` creates a promise for the object, which is not the same behavior as an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick()` is a function that queues a function to be called on the next cycle of the event loop, whereas `Q(object).nodeify` is a function that takes a nodeback argument and returns a promise for the object. The original code fragment `Q(object).nodeify` creates a promise for the object and then calls the nodeback function with the result or error. `Q.nextTick()` does not have this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior
