  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the result of `sin(θ)` would be different from `cos(θ)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` are trigonometric functions, and the result of `tan(θ)` would be different from `cos(θ)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the result of `acos(θ)` would be different from `cos(θ)`.

DONE.
