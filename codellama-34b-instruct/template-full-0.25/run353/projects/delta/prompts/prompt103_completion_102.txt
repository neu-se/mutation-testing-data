  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only keep operations with a `retain` property, while the original code keeps all operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only keep operations with a `delete` property, while the original code keeps all operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only keep operations with an `insert` property, while the original code keeps all operations.

DONE.
