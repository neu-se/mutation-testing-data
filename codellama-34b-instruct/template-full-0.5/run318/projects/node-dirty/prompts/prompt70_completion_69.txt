  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event is emitted when the database is fully loaded, while the `'error'` event is emitted when an error occurs. Using `'error'` instead of `'load'` would cause the `Dirty` class to emit an error event when the database is fully loaded, which would be unexpected and potentially cause issues for the users of the class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event is emitted when the database is fully loaded, while the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is drained. Using `'drain'` instead of `'load'` would cause the `Dirty` class to emit a drain event when the database is fully loaded, which would be unexpected and potentially cause issues for the users of the class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in
