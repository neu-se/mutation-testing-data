  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called immediately, instead of being called only when the current stream has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null, function(err, data) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called with a null error and a function that ignores its arguments, instead of being called with the original error and callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(true, function(err, data) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called with an error of `true`, instead of being called with the original error.

DONE.
