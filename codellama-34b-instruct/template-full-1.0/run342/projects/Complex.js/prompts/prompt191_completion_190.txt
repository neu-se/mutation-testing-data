  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(b, a)` is a different function from `Math.pow(a, b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(a)` is a different function from `Math.pow(a, b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a)` is a different function from `Math.pow(a, b)`.

DONE.
