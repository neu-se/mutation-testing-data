  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the diff algorithm to miss a potential difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the diff algorithm to incorrectly identify a difference where there is none.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the diff algorithm to incorrectly identify a difference where there is none.

DONE.
