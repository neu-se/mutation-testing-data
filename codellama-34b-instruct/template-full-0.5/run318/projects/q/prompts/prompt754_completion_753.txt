  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects the promise, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

DONE.
