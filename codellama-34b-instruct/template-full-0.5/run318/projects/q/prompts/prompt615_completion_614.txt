  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, rather than resolving with the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value of `object`, rather than rejecting with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("different value")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a different value than the original code, which would affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
