  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `name` is a string, while `name + "foo"` is a concatenation of a string and another string, resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `name` is a string, while `name.toUpperCase()` is a string in all uppercase letters, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `name` is a string, while `name.length` is the length of the string, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
