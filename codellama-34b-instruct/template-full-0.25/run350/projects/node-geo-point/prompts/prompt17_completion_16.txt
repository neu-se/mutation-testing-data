  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first element of the coordinates array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second element of the coordinates array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the third element of the coordinates array, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
