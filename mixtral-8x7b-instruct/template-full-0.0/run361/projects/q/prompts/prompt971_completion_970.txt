 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is returned instead of the `args` variable, which could cause issues if the continuation function expects a non-empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is returned instead of the `args` variable, which could cause issues if the continuation function does not handle `null` values correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because an object is returned instead of the `args` variable, which could cause issues if the continuation function expects an array.

DONE.
