  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `{}` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, { id: 'invalid' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `{ id: 'invalid' }` argument would cause the `getCountry` function to return a country object with an invalid `id` property, which would not match any existing country in the data.

DONE.
