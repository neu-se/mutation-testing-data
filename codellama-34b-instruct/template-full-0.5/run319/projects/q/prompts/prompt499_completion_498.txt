  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the presence of the `name` variable, which could cause an error if the variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the presence of the `name` variable, which could cause an error if the variable is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== null && name !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the `name` variable and would not allow the code to continue if the variable is not defined.

DONE.
