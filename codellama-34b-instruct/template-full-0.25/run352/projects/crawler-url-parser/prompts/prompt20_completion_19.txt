  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one, and also make the match case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one, and also make the match multi-line.

DONE.
