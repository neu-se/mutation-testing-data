  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === true) onEnd(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is called regardless of the value of `end`, whereas the replacement code fragment would only call `onEnd` if `end` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === false) onEnd(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is called regardless of the value of `end`, whereas the replacement code fragment would only call `onEnd` if `end` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end) onEnd(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is called regardless of the value of `end`, whereas the replacement code fragment would only call `onEnd` if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
