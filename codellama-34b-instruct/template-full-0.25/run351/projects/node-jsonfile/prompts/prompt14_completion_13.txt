  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `shouldThrow`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `shouldThrow`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `shouldThrow`.

DONE.
