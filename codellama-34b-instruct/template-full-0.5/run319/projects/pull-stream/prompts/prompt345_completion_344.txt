  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the equality operator `===` to check if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, while this replacement uses the assignment operator `=` to assign the value of `abort` to `true`. If `abort` is not strictly equal to `true`, the original code fragment would return `null`, while this replacement would return `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the equality operator `===` to check if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, while this replacement uses the inequality operator `!==` to check if `abort` is not strictly equal to `true`. If `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, the original code fragment would return `null`, while this replacement would return `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
