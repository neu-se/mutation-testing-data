  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different result, as `i` is a different value than `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different result, as `i + 1` is a different value than `null`.

DONE.
