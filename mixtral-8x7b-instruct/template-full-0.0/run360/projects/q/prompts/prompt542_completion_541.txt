 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new empty array, whereas the original code fragment reuses the `array` variable passed to the `spread` function. This could lead to issues if the original `array` variable is modified before the yielded promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the value of `this` in the context of the `spread` function, which might not be the expected array. The original code fragment expects an array, so using `this` could lead to unexpected results or even errors if `this` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the arguments list using `Array.prototype.slice`. While this creates an array-like object, it might not have the
