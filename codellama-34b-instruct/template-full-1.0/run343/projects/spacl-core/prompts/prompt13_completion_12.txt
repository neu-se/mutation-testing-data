  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!/[^/]:|:\/|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the exclamation point at the beginning of the regex inverts the match, causing the regex to match any string that does not match the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/*|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the asterisk is not escaped, causing it to match any number of characters, rather than just the literal asterisk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/+|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the plus sign is not escaped, causing it to match any number of characters, rather than just the literal plus sign.

DONE.
