  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `archive.directory` would treat the directory as if it contains files, even if it's empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!false
```
This would result in different behavior because `archive.directory` would treat the directory as if it contains files, even if it's empty and also would negate the truthiness of the boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `archive.directory` would treat the directory as if it contains files, even if it's empty and also would negate the null-ish value.

DONE.
