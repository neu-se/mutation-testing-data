  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This code fragment will remove the "http://" or "https://" protocol from the beginning of the URL, which may cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This code fragment will replace the "http://" or "https://" protocol with "ftp://", which may cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'file://')
```
This code fragment will replace the "http://" or "https://" protocol with "file://", which may cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
