  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a bound function, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return deferred.makeNodeResolver(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function that returns a function, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

DONE.
