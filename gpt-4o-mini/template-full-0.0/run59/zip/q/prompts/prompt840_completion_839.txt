Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of handling the error properly by forwarding it to the next tick or calling the `Q.onerror` handler, it simply logs the error to the console, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Unhandled promise rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error instead of passing the original error to the `onUnhandledError` function, which may lead to loss of the original error context and stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return; 
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the error, preventing any error handling from occurring, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections and make debugging difficult.

DONE.
