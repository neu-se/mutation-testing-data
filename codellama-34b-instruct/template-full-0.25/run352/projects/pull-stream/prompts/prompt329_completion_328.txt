  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is not being called with the correct argument. The original code fragment calls `op` with the `data` argument, but the modified code fragment calls `op` with the `data + 1` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is being called with a different argument. The original code fragment calls `op` with the `data` argument, but the modified code fragment calls `op` with the `data + 1` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is being called with a different number of arguments. The original code fragment calls `op` with a single argument, but the modified code fragment calls `op` with two arguments.

DONE.
