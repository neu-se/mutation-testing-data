  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'`, while this new fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices'`. This means that the new fragment would remove three characters from the end of the word instead of two, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'`, while this new fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i'`. This means that
