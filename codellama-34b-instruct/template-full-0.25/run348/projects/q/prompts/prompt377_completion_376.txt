  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method would be called with `undefined` instead of `newValue`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method would be called with `null` instead of `newValue`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method would be called with `0` instead of `newValue`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

DONE.
