Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` computes the natural logarithm of a number, which is fundamentally different from the exponential function `Math.exp`, leading to incorrect results in calculations that expect exponential growth.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `Math.exp` with `Math.exp(1)` would always return a constant value (approximately 2.718), ignoring the input `-x`, which would lead to incorrect results in the context of the hyperbolic cosine calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(2, -x)` computes 2 raised to the power of `-x`, which does not represent the same mathematical operation as `Math.exp`, leading to incorrect results in the context of hyperbolic functions.

DONE.
