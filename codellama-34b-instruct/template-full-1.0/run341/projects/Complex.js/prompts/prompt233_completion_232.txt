  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value for the square root of a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value for the square root of a negative number, and would also cause the function to return a different value for the square root of zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value for the square root of a negative number, and would also cause the function to return a different value for the square root of zero.

DONE.
