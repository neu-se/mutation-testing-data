  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `then` method, so calling `promise.then` on it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because `5` is a primitive value that does not have a `then` method, so calling `promise.then` on it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (){throw new Error("Error message")}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error when called, causing the promise to reject instead of resolving.

DONE.
