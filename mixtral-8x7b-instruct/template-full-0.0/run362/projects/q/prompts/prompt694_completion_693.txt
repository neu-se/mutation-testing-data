 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that always returns a resolved promise, instead of using the original object as the `this` value inside the returned function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that always rejects the promise with the error message 'Error', instead of using the original object as the `this` value inside the returned function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return this; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that does not take into account the original object or the passed arguments, and would always return the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).

DONE.
