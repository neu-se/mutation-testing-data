  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with a different set of operations than the original code, which could cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with a different set of operations than the original code, which could cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with a different set of operations than the original code, which could cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
