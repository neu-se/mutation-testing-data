  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeGenerator` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.async`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeGenerator` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.async`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this, arguments)();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeGenerator` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.async`.

DONE.
