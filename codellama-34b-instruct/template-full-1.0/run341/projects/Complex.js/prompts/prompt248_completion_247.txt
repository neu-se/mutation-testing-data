  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the value of Euler's number (e) raised to the power of the argument, while `Math.expm1` returns the value of Euler's number (e) raised to the power of the argument minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the argument, while `Math.expm1` returns the value of Euler's number (e) raised to the power of the argument minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the argument, while `Math.expm1` returns the value of Euler's number (e) raised to the power of the argument minus 1.

DONE.
