  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a 
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value of the hypot function to a null reference, effectively creating a divide by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b 
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value of the hypot function to a imaginary number, which would be a complex result when the argument is real.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c 
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value of the hypot function to a complex number, which would be a real result when the argument is complex.

DONE.
