  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const callbacks = this._queue.get(key) || [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `[]` as the default value for `this._queue.get(key)`, while this version uses an empty `Array`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const callbacks = this._queue.get(key) || new Set();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `[]` as the default value for `this._queue.get(key)`, while this version uses an empty `Set`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const callbacks = this._queue.get(key) || new Map();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `[]` as the default value for `this._queue.get(key)`, while this version uses an empty `Map`.

DONE.
