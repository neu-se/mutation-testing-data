  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the second-to-last character instead of the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra character instead of removing the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character and then return the substring from the beginning of the word to the second-to-last character.

DONE.
