  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function takes two arguments, the second of which specifies the index at which to start the slice. In the original code, the second argument is `void 0`, which indicates that the entire `arguments` array should be sliced. By replacing `void 0` with `1`, the slice will start at index 1 instead, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `-1`, which indicates that the slice should start at the last index of the `arguments` array. This would result in a different behavior because the `arguments` array is now sliced differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because
