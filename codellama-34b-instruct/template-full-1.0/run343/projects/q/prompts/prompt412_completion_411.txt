  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.status === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `status` property is not defined anywhere in the code, so it would always return `undefined`. Therefore, the `if` block would never be entered, and the promise would never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property is set to `pending` when the promise is created, and it is only changed to `fulfilled` or `rejected` when the promise is resolved or rejected. Therefore, this change would cause the `if` block to always be entered, even if the promise was never resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property is set to `pending` when the promise is created, and it is never changed. Therefore,
