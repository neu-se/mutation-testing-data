  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This will cause the new stack trace to be added to the end of the array, rather than the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift
```
This will cause the new stack trace to be added to the beginning of the array, rather than the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.unshift(promise.stack)
```
This will cause the new stack trace to be added to the beginning of the array, and will also include the stack trace of the `promise` object.

DONE.
