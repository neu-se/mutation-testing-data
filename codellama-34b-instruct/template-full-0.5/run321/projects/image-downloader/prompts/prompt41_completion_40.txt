  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would throw an error, while `reject` would reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` would return from the function, while `reject` would reject the promise.

DONE.
