  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string 'foo' to the key, which would cause the update to fail if the key is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the key to uppercase, which would cause the update to fail if the key is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the key, which would cause the update to fail if the key is not a string.

DONE.
