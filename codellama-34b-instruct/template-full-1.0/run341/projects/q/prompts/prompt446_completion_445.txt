  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, whereas the original code fragment uses `push()` to add the current promise to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas the original code fragment uses `push()` to add the current promise to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection()` method would be called on each element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, whereas the original code fragment does not call the method at all.

DONE.
