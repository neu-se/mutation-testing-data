  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether a string or substring is present in the string, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the substring if it is present, or -1 if it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, or -1 if it is not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array containing the matches, or null if no matches are found.

DONE.
