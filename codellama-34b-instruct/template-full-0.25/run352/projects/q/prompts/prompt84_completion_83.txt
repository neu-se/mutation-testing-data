  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be bound to a different context, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { requestTick(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be wrapped in a new function, which could affect its behavior.

DONE.
