  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, { allTimezones: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the country's timezones, instead of all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, { deprecated: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only non-deprecated timezones, instead of all timezones.

DONE.
