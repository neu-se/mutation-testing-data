  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the next op is not null, but if it's replaced with null, it will always evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the next op is not null, but if it's replaced with undefined, it will always evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the next op is not null, but if it's replaced with 0, it will always evaluate to false.

DONE.
