  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with the wrong number of operations, potentially leading to incorrect results in downstream code that uses the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<randInt(10, 100))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with a random number of operations, potentially leading to incorrect results in downstream code that uses the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()</code">
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with nested operations, potentially leading to incorrect results in downstream code that uses the `Delta` object.

DONE.
