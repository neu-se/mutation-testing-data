  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezonesMap === null` would always evaluate to `false` if `timezonesMap` is not null, whereas `!timezonesMap` would evaluate to `true` if `timezonesMap` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezonesMap.length === 0` would always evaluate to `false` if `timezonesMap` is not an array or if it has a length greater than 0, whereas `!timezonesMap` would evaluate to `true` if `timezonesMap` is not an array or if it has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof timezonesMap === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof timezonesMap === 'undefined'` would
