  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:  ```var i = 1```  This would result in different behavior because the loop would begin at 1 instead of 0, and the first element would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:  ```var i = -1```  This would result in different behavior because the loop would begin at -1 instead of 0, and the first element would be accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:  ```var i = Math.random()```  This would result in different behavior because the loop would begin at a random index instead of 0, and the first element would not be guaranteed to be accessed.

DONE.
