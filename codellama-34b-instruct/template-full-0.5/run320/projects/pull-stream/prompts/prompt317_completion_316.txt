  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with a different set of arguments. In the original code, `cb` is called with `ended` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument. In this option, `cb` is called with `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with a different set of arguments. In the original code, `cb` is called with `ended` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument. In this option, `cb` is called with `true` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
