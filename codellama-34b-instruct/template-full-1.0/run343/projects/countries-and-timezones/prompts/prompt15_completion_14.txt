  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r !== undefined` will always be true if `tz.r` is not undefined, regardless of the value of `tz.c`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== c
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r !== c` will always be true if `tz.r` and `c` have different values, regardless of whether `tz.r` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tz.c
```
This would result in different behavior because `!tz.c` will always be true if `tz.c` is falsy (e.g. null, undefined, 0, etc.), regardless of the value of `tz.r`.

DONE.
