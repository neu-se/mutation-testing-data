  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to have a non-null `attributes` property, which would not be allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to have an `attributes` property that is undefined, which would not be allowed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to have a null or undefined `attributes` property, which would not be allowed in the original code.

DONE.
