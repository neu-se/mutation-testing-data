  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a different function than `requestPortTick`, and it would cause the code to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would cause the `flush` function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds, whereas `requestPortTick` would execute it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` would cause the `flush` function to be executed at the end of the current event loop, whereas `requestPortTick` would execute it immediately.

DONE.
