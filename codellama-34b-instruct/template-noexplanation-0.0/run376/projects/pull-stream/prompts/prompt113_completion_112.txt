  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This change will cause the callback to be called with a null error and the accumulated value, regardless of whether the stream has ended or not. This change will likely cause the test suite to fail, as it will not be able to detect the error condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This change will cause the callback to be called with the error and a null value, regardless of whether the stream has ended or not. This change will likely cause the test suite to fail, as it will not be able to detect the error condition.
