  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the value at that index may be different from the value at the original index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value at the index is now different from the original value, and the `+ 1` operator changes the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value at the index is now different from the original value, and the `* 2` operator changes the value.

DONE.
