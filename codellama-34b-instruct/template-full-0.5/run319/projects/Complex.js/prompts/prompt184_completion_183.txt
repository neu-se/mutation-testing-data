  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is equal to zero and `b` is greater than zero, even if `a` and `b` are not equal to zero and one, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is equal to one and `b` is greater than zero, even if `a` and `b` are not equal to zero and one, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is equal to zero and `b` is equal to one, even if `
