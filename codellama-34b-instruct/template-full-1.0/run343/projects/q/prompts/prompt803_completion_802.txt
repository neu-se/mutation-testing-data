  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"always-be-progressed"
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with the string "always-be-progressed", which would never be a valid progress update.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with null, which would be a valid progress update.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called at all, since undefined is not a valid function.

DONE.
