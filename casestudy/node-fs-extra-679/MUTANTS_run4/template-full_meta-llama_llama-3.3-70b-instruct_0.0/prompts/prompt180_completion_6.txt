Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.normalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.normalize` is used to normalize a path, resolving sequences like `../` and `./`, whereas `path.parse` is used to parse a path into its components, which is what the original code intended to use to get the root of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
destParent => destParent
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would return the `destParent` as is, without parsing it to get the root, which could lead to incorrect results if the `destParent` is not already the root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('url').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `require('url').parse` is used to parse a URL, not a file path, which would not work correctly with the `destParent` variable, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
