  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is called after the task is completed, while `flush()` would call the function immediately, which could cause the task to be executed multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that takes a single argument, which is the task to be executed, while `flush(null)` would pass `null` as the task to be executed, which could cause the task to not be executed at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that takes a single argument, which is the task to be executed, while `flush(undefined)` would pass `undefined` as the task to be executed, which could cause the task to not be executed at all.

DONE.
