  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the property of the object with the given key, rather than checking if the key is present in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has the given key as its own property, rather than checking if the key is present in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the property of the object with the given key, rather than checking if the key is present in the object.

DONE.
