  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the array is empty, whereas the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the array has at least one element, whereas the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the array has exactly one element, whereas the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy.

DONE.
