  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a zero argument, which would cause the iterator to return the first element of the array, rather than the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a one argument, which would cause the iterator to return the second element of the array, rather than the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with the length of the array minus one as the argument, which would cause the iterator to return the last element of the array, rather than the next element.

DONE.
