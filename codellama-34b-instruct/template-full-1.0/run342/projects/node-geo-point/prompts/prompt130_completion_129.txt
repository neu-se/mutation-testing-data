  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null pointer value that does not have properties or methods, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` creates a new object with no properties or methods, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

DONE.
