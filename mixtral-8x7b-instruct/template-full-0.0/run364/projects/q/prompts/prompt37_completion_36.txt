 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always be true, and the exception would be thrown asynchronously in browsers, even if it was caught in the same event loop tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always be false, and the exception would not be thrown at all, even in Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would check for nullity instead of truthiness, and the exception would not be thrown in Node.js or in browsers where `process` is not defined.

DONE.
