  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the contents of the delta, whereas `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new op at the specified index, whereas `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the contents of the delta, whereas `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas.

DONE.
