  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country === null` checks if it is strictly equal to `null`. If `country` is `undefined`, `!country` would return `true`, but `country === null` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country !== null` checks if it is not strictly equal to `null`. If `country` is `undefined`, `!country` would return `true`, but `country !== null` would return `true` if `country` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country == null` checks
