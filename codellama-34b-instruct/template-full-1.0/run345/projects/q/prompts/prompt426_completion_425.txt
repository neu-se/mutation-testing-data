```
 <PLACEHOLDER: > False)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only be called if the input parameter is false, and the function would not be called if the input parameter is any other value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can replace:
```
 <PLACEHOLDER: > False)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only be called if the input parameter is false, and the function would not be called if the input parameter is any other value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can replace:
```
 <PLACEHOLDER: > False)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only be called if the input parameter is false, and the function would not be called if the input parameter is any other value.

By injecting this change, we can demonstrate the importance of test coverage and edge cases when building a promise library, as a seemingly trivial change can have significant effects on the overall behavior of the library.
