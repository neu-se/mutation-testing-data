  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function as the first argument, but this replacement would pass a string instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function as the first argument, but this replacement would pass a number instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function as the first argument, but this replacement would pass null instead.

DONE.
