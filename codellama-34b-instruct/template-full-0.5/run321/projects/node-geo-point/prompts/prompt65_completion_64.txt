  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 180 from the longitude difference, which is necessary to ensure that the resulting angle is in the range of -180 to 180 degrees. By adding 180 instead of subtracting it, the resulting angle would be outside of this range, causing incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is dividing the longitude difference by 2, which is necessary to ensure that the resulting angle is in the range of -180 to 180 degrees. By multiplying the longitude difference by 2 instead of dividing it, the resulting angle would be outside of this range, causing incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the
