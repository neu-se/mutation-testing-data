 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign calculation now depends on the remainder of dividing `minus` by 3 instead of 2, which would cause incorrect signs for some input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '+') + c
