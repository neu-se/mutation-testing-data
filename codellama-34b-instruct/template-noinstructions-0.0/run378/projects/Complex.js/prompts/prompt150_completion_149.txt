  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the complex number was infinite, while the new code fragment would be checking if the complex number is infinite and also calling the `isInfinite` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the complex number was infinite and also checking if the other complex number was infinite, while the new code fragment would be checking if the complex number is infinite and also checking if the other complex number is infinite and also calling the `isInfinite` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the complex number was infinite or if the other complex number was infinite, while the new code fragment would be checking if the complex
