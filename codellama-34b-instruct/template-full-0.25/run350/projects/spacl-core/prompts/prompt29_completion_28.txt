  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is being called on the `parts` array with a different accumulator initial value, which would cause the resulting regex to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '^')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is being called on the `parts` array with a different accumulator initial value, which would cause the resulting regex to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is being called on the `parts` array with a different accumulator initial value, which would cause the resulting regex to be different.

DONE.
