  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "null" instead of the string "undefined".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "SOH" instead of the string "undefined".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "STX" instead of the string "undefined".

DONE.
