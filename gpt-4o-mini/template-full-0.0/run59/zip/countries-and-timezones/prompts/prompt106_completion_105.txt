Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `country` is strictly equal to `null`, while the original code checks for both `null` and `undefined` values, potentially allowing undefined countries to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `country` is strictly equal to `undefined`, which means that a valid country object that is `null` would incorrectly be treated as valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country || country.id === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition that checks if the `id` property of `country` is an empty string, which could lead to valid country objects being incorrectly rejected if they have an empty `id`.

DONE.
