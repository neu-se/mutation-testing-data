  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Q` object is a promise library, and `Q(callback)` creates a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Q` object is a promise library, and `Q(callback)` creates a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the callback.
