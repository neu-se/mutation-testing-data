  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `false` for non-finite numbers, whereas `isNaN` returns `true` for non-finite numbers. This could cause the `Complex` constructor to return `NaN` or `Infinity` for certain inputs, which could affect the behavior of the `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` for non-finite numbers, whereas `isFinite` returns `false` for non-finite numbers. This could cause the `Complex` constructor to return `NaN` or `Infinity` for certain inputs, which could affect the behavior of the `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(a) && isFinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite
