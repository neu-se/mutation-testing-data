  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `isPromise`, so the code would enter the `if` block if `isPromise` is `false`, and the `else` block if `isPromise` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than `isPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` checks if a promise is in the pending state, which may have different behavior than `isPromise`.

DONE.
