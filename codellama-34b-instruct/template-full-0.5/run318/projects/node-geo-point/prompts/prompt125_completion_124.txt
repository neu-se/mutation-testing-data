  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between two points, whereas the original code uses the Haversine formula, which is more accurate for calculating distances on a sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(this.latitude - point.latitude) + Math.abs(this.longitude - point.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the Manhattan distance between two points, which is the sum of the absolute differences in latitude and longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 2)
