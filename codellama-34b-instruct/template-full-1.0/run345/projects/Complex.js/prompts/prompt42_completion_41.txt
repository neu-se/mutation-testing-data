  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a * a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was squaring the `b` value before adding it to the square of `a`, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a * b + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `a` value twice before adding it to the `b` value, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `a` value twice before adding it to the `b` value, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
