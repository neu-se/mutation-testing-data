  Sure, here are three options to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the given code with buggy code fragments having different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object or null, while this code checks if it's a string. This would cause the `length` function to return a different value if `op.retain` is a string, which could lead to incorrect results in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object or null, while this code checks if `op.insert` is a number. This would cause the `length` function to return a different value if `op.insert` is a number, which could lead to incorrect results in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
