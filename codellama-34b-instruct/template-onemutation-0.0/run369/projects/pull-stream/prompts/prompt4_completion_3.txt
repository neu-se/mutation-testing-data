  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `in` operator to iterate over the keys of the `throughs` object, while the modified code fragment uses the `=` operator to assign the value `0` to the variable `k`. The `=` operator does not iterate over the keys of an object, so the modified code fragment would not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
