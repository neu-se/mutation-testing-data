  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δ.eachLine()` method would iterate over each line of the document, instead of each element in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δ.eachLine()` method would iterate over each line of the document, instead of each element in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δ.eachLine()` method would iterate over each line of the document, instead of each element in the `ops` array.

DONE.
