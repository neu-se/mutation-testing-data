  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * a + b * b)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `Math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * a - b * b)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `Math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of the difference of the squares of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * b)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `Math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
