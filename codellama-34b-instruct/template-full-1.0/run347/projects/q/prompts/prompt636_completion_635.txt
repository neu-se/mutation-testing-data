  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a non-callable value, and attempting to call it as a function would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a numeric literal, and attempting to call it as a function would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a boolean value, and attempting to call it as a function would result in a `TypeError`.

DONE.
