  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezonesForCountry` returns an array of timezone objects, whereas `getCountry` returns a single country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountriesForCountry` returns an array of country objects, whereas `getCountry` returns a single country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` returns a single timezone object, whereas `getCountry` returns a single country object.

DONE.
