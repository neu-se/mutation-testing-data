  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the algorithm to miss certain operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the algorithm to include operations that should not be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the algorithm to include operations that should not be included and miss certain operations.

DONE.
