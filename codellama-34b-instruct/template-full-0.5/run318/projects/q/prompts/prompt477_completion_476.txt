  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return the index of the next element in the array, rather than the index of the current element, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return the index of the previous element in the array, rather than the index of the current element, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return the index of the element two positions ahead of the current element, rather than the index of the current element, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
