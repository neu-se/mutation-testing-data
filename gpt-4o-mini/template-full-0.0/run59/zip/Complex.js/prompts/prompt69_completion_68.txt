Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid input type');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of error thrown from a `SyntaxError` to a generic `Error`, which may not be caught by existing error handling that specifically checks for `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing an error when the input is invalid, it silently returns `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code that expects a valid `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = 1; z['im'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns default values of `1` to both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of throwing an error, which could lead to incorrect calculations later in the program.

DONE.
