  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would include the entire buffer, while the new code fragment would only include the buffer up to the last character. This would cause the error message to be different, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
