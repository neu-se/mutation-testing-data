  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` method to use a different delimiter, potentially returning a different array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` method to use the same delimiter as the original code, potentially returning the same array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` method to use a different delimiter, potentially returning a different array of strings.

DONE.
