  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["newArg"])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(["newArg"])` would return a new array containing all the elements of `args` plus the new argument `"newArg"`, whereas `args` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause the function to return `undefined`, whereas `args` would return the original array.

DONE.
