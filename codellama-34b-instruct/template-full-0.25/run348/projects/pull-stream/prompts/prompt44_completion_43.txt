  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error when trying to call `pull.apply(undefined, ref)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error when trying to call `pull.apply(null, ref[0])`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` and `ref[1]` are not functions, and would cause a runtime error when trying to call `pull.apply(ref[0], ref[1])`.

DONE.
