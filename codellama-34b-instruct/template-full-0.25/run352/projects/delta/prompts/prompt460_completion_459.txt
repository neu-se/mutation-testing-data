  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `slice` method to start at the next index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `slice` method to start at the previous index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to start at the end of the `ops` array instead of the current index, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

DONE.
