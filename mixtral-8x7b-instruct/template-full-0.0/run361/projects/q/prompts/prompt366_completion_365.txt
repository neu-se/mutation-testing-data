 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved promise would be rejected instead, causing the chained `.then()` to execute the rejected handler instead of the fulfilled handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved promise would be sent as a progress notification instead of fulfilling the promise, causing the chained `.then()` to execute the progress handler if one is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.resolve()` method is called on the `deferred` object itself, which is not a function and would result in an error. The original code calls the `.resolve()` method on the `deferred` object with `_fulfilled(value)` as its argument.

DONE.
