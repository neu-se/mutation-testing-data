  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `resetUnhandledRejections` with `undefined` as an argument, which would have no effect. In contrast, the new code fragment calls `resetUnhandledRejections` with an empty array as an argument, which would clear the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(["dummy reason"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `resetUnhandledRejections` with `undefined` as an argument, which would have no effect. In contrast, the new code fragment calls `resetUnhandledRejections` with an array containing a single string as an argument, which would add a reason to the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(unhandledReasons);
```
