  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessagePort !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `MessagePort` is a constructor for a message port object, which is different from `MessageChannel`, which is a constructor for a message channel object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageEvent !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `MessageEvent` is an event type that is used to represent a message event, which is different from `MessageChannel`, which is a constructor for a message channel object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.nextTick !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that is used to schedule a task to be executed after the current event loop, which is different from `MessageChannel`, which is a constructor for a message channel object.

DONE.
