  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is being called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is being called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x*x` is not the same as `sin(x)` or `cos(x)`.

DONE.
