  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && stream.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the stream is an object and has a length greater than 0, whereas the original code fragment would return true if the stream is an object regardless of its length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && stream.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the stream is an object and has a length of 0, whereas the original code fragment would return true if the stream is an object regardless of its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && stream.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the stream is an object and has a length less than 0, whereas the original code fragment would return true if the stream is an object regardless of its length.
