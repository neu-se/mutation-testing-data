  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called twice, once for each event emitted by the `writeStream`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called when an error occurs, rather than when the `writeStream` is drained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called when the `writeStream` is finished writing, rather than when it is drained.

DONE.
