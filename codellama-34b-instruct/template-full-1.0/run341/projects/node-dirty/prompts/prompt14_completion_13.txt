  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val => this.cb(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call `cb` on every element in the `cbs` list, while the new code would only call `cb` on the last element in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val => this.cb(val + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call `cb` with the original value, while the new code would call `cb` with the value incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val => this.cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call `cb` with the original value, while the new code would call `cb` with `undefined`.

DONE.
