  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an offset of 10 degrees in the longitude calculation, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitude difference by 2, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an offset of -10 degrees in the longitude calculation, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
