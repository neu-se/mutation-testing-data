  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```console
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned index would be one position further to the right than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```console
8, -9
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned index would be too far to the left and return a negative index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```console
8, -1, 7
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument would completely change the outcome of the function. 

DONE.
