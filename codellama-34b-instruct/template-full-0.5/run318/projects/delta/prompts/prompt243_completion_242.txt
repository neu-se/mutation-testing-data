  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would be called with a different argument, which could affect the result of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would be called on a different iterator, which could have a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherIter.next(opLength))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would be called with a different argument, which could affect the result of the method.

DONE.
