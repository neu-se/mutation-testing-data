  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:./
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character, including / and ?, instead of matching only a single character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match one or more of any character, including / and ?, instead of matching only a single character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match one or more characters that are not /, instead of matching only a single character.

DONE.
