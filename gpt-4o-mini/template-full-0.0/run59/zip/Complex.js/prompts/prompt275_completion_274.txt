Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of `a` instead of the sine, leading to incorrect results for the sine function of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of `a + 1`, effectively shifting the input by 1 radian, which alters the output of the sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a`, which is not the intended calculation for the sine of a complex number.

DONE.
