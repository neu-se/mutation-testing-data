Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of `λ2` by using the sine of `φ1` instead of the original `y` value, which is derived from the sine of the bearing and the angular distance, leading to incorrect longitude calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the calculation of `λ2` by using the cosine of the bearing instead of the original `y` value, which would result in an incorrect adjustment of the longitude based on the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the `y` component of the calculation, leading to a constant longitude value regardless of the bearing and distance, which would not reflect the intended destination point.

DONE.
