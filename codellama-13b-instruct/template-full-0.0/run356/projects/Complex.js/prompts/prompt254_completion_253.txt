  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the exponential of `a` and then multiplies it by `Math.cos(b)`, while this alternative calculates the exponential of `a + i*b` and then multiplies it by `Math.cos(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the exponential of `a` and then multiplies it by `Math.cos(b)`, while this alternative calculates the exponential of `b` and then multiplies it by `Math.cos(a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the exponential of `a` and then multiplies it by `Math.cos(b)`, while this alternative calculates the exponential of `a + b` and
