  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would cause the condition to always be false, which would prevent the `trackRejection` function from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` would cause the condition to always be true, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called unconditionally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections ^ true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^ true` would cause the condition to be negated, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called when it would not have been called otherwise.

DONE.
