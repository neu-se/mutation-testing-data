  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the `latitude` and `longitude` properties directly, rather than using `hasOwnProperty()` to check if they are defined on the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are not defined on the object itself, rather than checking if they are defined on the object or its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === null || object.longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are null, rather than checking if they are undefined.

DONE.
