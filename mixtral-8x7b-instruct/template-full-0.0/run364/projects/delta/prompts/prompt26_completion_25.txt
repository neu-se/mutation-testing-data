 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` only returns the enumerable and non-enumerable own properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns only the enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Reflect.ownKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.ownKeys` returns all own property keys of an object, including symbols, while `Object.keys` returns only the enumerable string keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const key in a) {
  if (a.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    attributes[key] = b[key] === undefined ? null : b[key];
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop with `hasOwnProperty` check ensures that only the object's own enumerable properties are
