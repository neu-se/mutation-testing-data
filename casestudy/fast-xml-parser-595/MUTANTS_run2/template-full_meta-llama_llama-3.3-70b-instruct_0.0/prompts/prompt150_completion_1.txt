Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.options.tagValueProcessor(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was directly using the `val` whereas the mutated code is passing `val` to the `tagValueProcessor` function which could potentially alter the value before it's used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attrStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the text value `val` whereas the mutated code is using the attribute string `attrStr` which could lead to incorrect XML structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the actual text value `val` whereas the mutated code is using an empty string which would result in empty text nodes in the XML output.

DONE.
