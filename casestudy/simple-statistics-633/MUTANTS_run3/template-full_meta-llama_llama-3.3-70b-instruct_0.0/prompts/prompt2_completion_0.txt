Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof x !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input array `x` is not an object, which is a different condition than checking if the `sum` variable is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the input array `x` is less than 0, which is always false since array lengths are non-negative, but it's a different condition than the original one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sum === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `sum` variable is equal to NaN, which is a different condition than checking if `sum` is not a number, since NaN is a special value in JavaScript that is not equal to anything, including itself.

DONE.
