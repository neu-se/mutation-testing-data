 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the attributes object with null, causing an error when trying to access properties of a null value in the following lines of code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the attributes object with an empty object, causing any existing attributes to be lost.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the attributes of the lastOp instead of the newOp, causing any changes to the attributes of the newOp to be ignored.

DONE.
