  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is the result of concatenating the `args` array with the `value` argument, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the generator function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.map(function(arg) { return arg * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method creates a new array with each element being the result of the callback function applied to the corresponding element of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the generator function.

DONE.
