  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's a string. If `op.delete` is a string, the original code would return `op.delete`, while this code would return `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's defined. If `op.delete` is undefined, the original code would return `op.delete`, while this code would return `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's greater than 0. If `op.delete` is greater than 0
