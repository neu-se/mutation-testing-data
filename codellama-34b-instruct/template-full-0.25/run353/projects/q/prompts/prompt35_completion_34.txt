  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with `null` as an argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when called with the original argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when called with the original argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with `0` as an argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when called with the original argument.

DONE.
