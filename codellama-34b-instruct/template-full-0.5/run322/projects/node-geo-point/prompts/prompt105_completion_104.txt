  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would shift the result by 1, which would cause the `Math.floor` function to round down to a different tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the result, which would cause the `Math.floor` function to round down to a different tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 from the result, which
