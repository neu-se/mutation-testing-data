Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the verb to 'GET', which may not reflect the actual action being performed, potentially leading to incorrect permission checks for other verbs like 'POST' or 'DELETE'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the verb by appending an 's', which could lead to incorrect rule matching since the modified verb may not correspond to any defined actions in the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the verb would likely cause the rule's query method to behave unexpectedly, potentially bypassing the intended permission checks altogether.

DONE.
