  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `value` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.then(function(value) { return value; })` is a promise that resolves to the value of `value`, whereas `value` is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(value) { return value.then; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.then(function(value) { return value.then; })` is a promise that resolves to the `then` method of `value`, whereas `value` is a promise.

DONE.
