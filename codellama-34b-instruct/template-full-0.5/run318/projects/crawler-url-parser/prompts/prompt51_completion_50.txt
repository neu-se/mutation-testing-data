  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is the parsed URL object, while `parsedBaseUrl` is the parsed base URL object. Using `parsedUrl` as the argument to `URL.resolve()` would cause the function to resolve the URL relative to the current URL, rather than the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl` is the base URL object, while `parsedBaseUrl` is the parsed base URL object. Using `baseUrl` as the argument to `URL.resolve()` would cause the function to resolve the URL relative to the base URL, rather than the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument to `URL.resolve()`. The function would throw an error when called with `null`.

DONE.
