  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.latitude - point.latitude) * (this.longitude - point.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance using the Haversine formula, while this code calculates the Euclidean distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.latitude + point.latitude) * (this.longitude + point.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance using the Haversine formula, while this code calculates the Manhattan distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.latitude + point.latitude) % 360 * (this.longitude + point.longitude) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance using the Haversine formula, while this code calculates the distance using the Haversine formula modified to handle longitudes outside the
