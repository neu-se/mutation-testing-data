  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the promise onto the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last item from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first item from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
