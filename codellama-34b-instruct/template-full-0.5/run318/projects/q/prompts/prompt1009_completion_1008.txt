  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, and the callback would not be passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have two elements instead of one, and the callback would be passed to the `dispatch` method twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a negative length, and the `dispatch` method would throw an error.

DONE.
