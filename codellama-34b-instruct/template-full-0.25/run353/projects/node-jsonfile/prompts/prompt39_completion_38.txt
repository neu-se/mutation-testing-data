  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that writes data to a file, while `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that writes data to a file. Using `fs.writeFileSync` in the code would cause the function to block until the file is written, which could lead to performance issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that is bound to the `fs` object, while `fs.writeFile` is an unbound function. Using a bound function could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(
