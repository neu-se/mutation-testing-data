  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isObject` function to always return `false`, even if the input is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof input === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `typeof` operator to always return `"Object"`, even if the input is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `instanceof` operator to always return `false`, even if the input is an object.

DONE.
