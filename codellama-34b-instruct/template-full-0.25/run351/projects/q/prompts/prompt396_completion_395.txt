  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code fragment, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code fragment, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value - 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code fragment, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

DONE.
