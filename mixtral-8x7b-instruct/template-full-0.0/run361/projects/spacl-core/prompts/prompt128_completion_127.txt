 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the last captured group to match if the context property exists, even if the count is exceeded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if the context is provided, even if the captured groups don't match the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the first context property to match if the count is 0, even if the captured groups don't match the properties.

DONE.
