  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pass the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to the `resume` method. Replacing it with `res.resume(null);` would pass `null` instead, which could cause the `resume` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pass the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to the `resume` method. Replacing it with `res.resume(undefined);` would pass `undefined` instead, which could cause the `resume` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(res.statusCode
