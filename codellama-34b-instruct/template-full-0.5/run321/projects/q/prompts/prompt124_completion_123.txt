  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `undefined` would cause the `object_keys` function to return a different value for objects with `undefined` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || object[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `undefined` would cause the `object_keys` function to return a different value for objects with `undefined` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `null` would cause the `object_keys` function to return a different value for objects with `null` properties.

DONE.
