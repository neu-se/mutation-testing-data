  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Replace `currentUrlStr` with a random string
Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 8)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would throw an error when attempting to parse a random string as a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Replace `currentUrlStr` with a boolean value
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would throw an error when attempting to parse a boolean value as a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Replace `currentUrlStr` with an object
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would throw an error when attempting to parse an object as a URL.

DONE.
