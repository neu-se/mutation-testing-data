  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute called "href" on an element with the tag name "base", but the replaced code fragment is looking for an attribute called "href" on an element with the tag name "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute called "href" on an element with the tag name "base", but the replaced code fragment is looking for an attribute called "href" on an element with the tag name "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute called "href" on an element with the tag name "base", but the replaced code fragment is looking for an attribute called "href" on an element with the tag name "a".

DONE.
