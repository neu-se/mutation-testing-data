  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would consider the second component of the `diffResult` array, which may contain a different type of change (insert, delete, or equal) than the first component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would consider the third component of the `diffResult` array, which may contain a different type of change (insert, delete, or equal) than the first or second components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would consider the fourth component of the `diffResult` array, which may contain a different type of change (insert, delete, or equal) than the first three components.

DONE.
