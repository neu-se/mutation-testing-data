  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This change replaces the newline character (`\n`) with the carriage return character (`\r`), which is a different character and may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r\n/g, EOL
```
This change replaces the newline character (`\n`) with the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`), which is a different sequence of characters and may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\r'
```
This change replaces the newline character (`\n`) with the carriage return character (`\r`), which is a different character and may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
