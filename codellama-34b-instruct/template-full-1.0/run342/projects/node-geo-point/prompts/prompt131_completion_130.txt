  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator is applied to the `zoom` variable, which will result in the negative of the zoom level being passed to the `toTile` method. This could cause an invalid tile to be generated, which could in turn cause errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` variable is being multiplied by itself, which could cause the zoom level to be increased exponentially. This could cause the application to generate tiles that are far too large or small, leading to errors or inaccuracies in the map display.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number between 0 and 1 is being multiplied by the `zoom` variable. This could cause the application to generate tiles that are randomly located within the current
