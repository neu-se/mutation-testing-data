  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b)` is a function that returns the cosine of `b`, whereas `cosm1` is a function that returns the cosine of `b` minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is a function that returns the sine of `b`, whereas `cosm1` is a function that returns the cosine of `b` minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(b)` is a function that returns the tangent of `b`, whereas `cosm1` is a function that returns the cosine of `b` minus 1.

DONE.
