  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not the same as the `null` value, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` expression would decrease the value of `i` by 1, which would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i], array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array[i]` expression would return the value at the `i`th index of the `array` object, which would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
