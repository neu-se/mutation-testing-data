 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortErr` would not be passed to the callback, and the error would not be properly handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be a random number instead of a function, causing an error in the line `_read = stream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once.sync
```
This would result in different behavior because `once.sync` is a synchronous version of the `once` function, which would cause the function to behave differently when dealing with streams.

DONE.
