Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine function instead of the cosine function, leading to incorrect calculations in the complex exponential formula.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the tangent function instead of the cosine function, which would produce incorrect results in the complex exponential calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the hyperbolic cosine function instead of the cosine function, resulting in a fundamentally different output for the complex exponential operation.

DONE.
