  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm with base `b` instead of base `e`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm of `a + 1` instead of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm of `a * b` instead of `a`.

DONE.
