  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is a function that always returns `false`, whereas `!ses.ok()` is a negation of the `ses.ok()` function, which returns `true` if the current environment is a secure environment, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isNotOk()` is a function that always returns `true`, whereas `!ses.ok()` is a negation of the `ses.ok()` function, which returns `true` if the current environment is a secure environment, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isOk()` is a function that always returns `true`, whereas `!ses.ok()` is
