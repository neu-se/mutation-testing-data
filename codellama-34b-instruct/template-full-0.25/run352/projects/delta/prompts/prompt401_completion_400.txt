  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length` is a number, while `thisData` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` is a number, while `otherData` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.retain` is a number, while `thisData` is an object.

DONE.
