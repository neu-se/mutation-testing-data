  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if the `done` callback is falsy, but instead would call the `done` function and pass its return value to the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` and the `if` statement would never be entered, regardless of the value of `done`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `done` is truthy or falsy, but would not short-circuit the logical expression if `done` is falsy, causing the `if` statement to always be executed.

DONE.
