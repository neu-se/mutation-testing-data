Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the current `Delta` instance with itself instead of comparing it with the `other` instance, leading to incorrect diff results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'placeholder_string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a static string for comparison instead of the actual string representation of the `other` `Delta`, which would always yield a non-matching result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `diff` function, potentially causing it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly when trying to process a `null` value instead of a valid string.

DONE.
