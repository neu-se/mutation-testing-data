  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(index));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is not defined in the original code, and its use would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(i));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not defined in the original code, and its use would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is not defined in the original code, and its use would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
