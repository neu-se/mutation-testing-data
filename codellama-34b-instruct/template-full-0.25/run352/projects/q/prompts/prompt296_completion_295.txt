  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join `y` with `y` instead of `x` and `y`, which could produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(Q.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the resolved value instead of returning the value as-is, which could produce a different result.

DONE.
