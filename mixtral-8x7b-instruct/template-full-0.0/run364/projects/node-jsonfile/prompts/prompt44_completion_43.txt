 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a second argument to be an object, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a second argument to be an object, and passing a boolean would not provide the desired options for stringifying the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a second argument to be an object, and passing a function would not provide the desired options for stringifying the object.

DONE.
