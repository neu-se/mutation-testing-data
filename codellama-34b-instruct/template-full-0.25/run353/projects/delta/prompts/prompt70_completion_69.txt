  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'string' &&
      attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `attributes` variable is a string and has a length greater than 0, without checking if it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` variable is an object and has no keys, without checking if it has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` variable is an object and has at least one key, without checking if it has a length greater than 0.
