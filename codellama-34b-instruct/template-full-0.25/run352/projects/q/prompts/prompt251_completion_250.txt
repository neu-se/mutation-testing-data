  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set only when `Q.longStackSupport` is `true` and `hasStacks` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set whenever either `Q.longStackSupport` or `hasStacks` is `true`, regardless of the value of the other variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.stack` property to never be set, regardless of the values of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks`.

DONE.
