  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Delta object that contains all the elements of the original Delta object except for the first one, whereas the original code fragment would return a new Delta object that contains all the elements of the original Delta object except for the last one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Delta object that contains all the elements of the original Delta object except for the last one, whereas the original code fragment would return a new Delta object that contains all the elements of the original Delta object except for the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Delta object that contains all the elements of the original Delta object except for the first and last ones, whereas the
