  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would be called with the `data` argument, which would cause the `drain` function to return early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause the `drain` function to return early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would be called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause the `drain` function to return early.

DONE.
