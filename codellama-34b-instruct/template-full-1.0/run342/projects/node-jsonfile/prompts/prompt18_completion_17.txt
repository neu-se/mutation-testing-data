  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileAndSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileAndSync` is not a valid method in the `fs` module, whereas `readFileSync` is. The try-catch block would catch the error and return `null` as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.nope
```
This would result in different behavior because `nope` is not a valid method in the `fs` module, and would cause a ReferenceError to be thrown when attempting to call it. The error would propagate up the call stack and eventually be caught by the try-catch block, returning `null` as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is not a valid method in the `fs` module, and would cause a ReferenceError to be thrown when attempting to call it. The error would propagate up the call stack and eventually be caught
