  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `reject` function would not be called with the expected exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `reject` function would not be called with the expected exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error message would be passed to the `reject` function, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting a specific error message.

DONE.
