  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `allResolved` would not be called, and the string "allResolved" would not be used as a function name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `allSettled` would be called instead of `allResolved`, and the string "allSettled" would be used as a function name instead of "allResolved".
