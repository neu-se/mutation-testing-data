 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the length of the next operation in the current iterator, rather than the length of the operation itself. This could lead to incorrect calculations when deleting or retaining operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0 as the length of the operation, regardless of its actual length. This could lead to incorrect deletions or insertions in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number between 0 and 1, rather than the length of the operation. This could lead to unpredictable behavior in the delta, such as inserting or deleting incorrect lengths.

DONE.
