Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from "post" to "get", which may not be supported by the object, leading to a different execution path or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the dispatch call, which could change how the method is processed or lead to unexpected results if the method does not handle additional arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `nodeArgs` from the dispatch call and changes the failure handling to resolve the deferred instead of rejecting it, which would alter the intended error handling logic.

DONE.
