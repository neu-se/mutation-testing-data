  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is asynchronous, while `fs.readFileSync` is synchronous.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is synchronous, while `fs.readFile` is asynchronous.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync('file.json')
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` reads the file synchronously, while `fs.readFile` reads the file asynchronously.

DONE.
