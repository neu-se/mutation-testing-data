  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit` would be called twice, which could cause unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.run
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.run` would be called with a different argument, which could cause the domain to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter` would be called with a different argument, which could cause the domain to behave differently.

DONE.
