  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, but it is not being called in the original code. By adding the parentheses, we are actually calling the function, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.
