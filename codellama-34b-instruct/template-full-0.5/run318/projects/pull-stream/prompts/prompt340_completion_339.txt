  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single object, while the mutated code fragment `field(data) + 1` is an object with an additional property `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single object, while the mutated code fragment `field(data) * 2` is an object with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single object, while the mutated code fragment `field(data) - 1` is an object with a different value.

DONE.
