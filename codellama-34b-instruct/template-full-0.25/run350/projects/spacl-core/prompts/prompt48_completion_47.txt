  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string to the props array, rather than just the part after the colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1).toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string to the props array in lowercase, rather than the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1).split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string to the props array in reverse order, rather than the original order.

DONE.
