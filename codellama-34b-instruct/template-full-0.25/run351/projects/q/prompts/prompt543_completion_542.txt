  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` is a number, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

DONE.
