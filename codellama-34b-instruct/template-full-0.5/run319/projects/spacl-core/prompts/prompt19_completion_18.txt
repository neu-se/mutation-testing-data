  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `string.length` check would always return `true` for any non-empty string, even if it doesn't end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 || string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `string.length` check would always return `true` for any string with a length greater than one, even if it doesn't end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('//')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `string.endsWith` check would always return `true` for any string that ends with two slashes, even if it doesn't end with a single slash.

DONE.
