Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with ` null ` instead of `_writeFile `.
`null` evaluates to false which will prevent chaining and return a null value instead of a stream as the original code does. This changes how the function works by returning the null value instead of chaining.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `_readFile `.
`_readfile` is a function and a property name in the readFile object that represents the readFile function. Replacing it with its name results in infinite recursion and causes the process to crash with a stack overflow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `_fs`.
`_fs` is a variable name in the readFile object that represents the file system. It is not a function, so replacing it with its name would cause scope issues and result in unexpected behavior.

Mutation analysis can be automated in a test suite using the mutation operator to generate mutants and run them against the test suite. The mutation operator is typically used in conjunction with a test case execution and results in
