  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (aborted) {
  cb(aborted);
  abortCb && abortCb(aborted);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `aborted` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (aborted === true) {
  cb(aborted);
  abortCb && abortCb(aborted);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (aborted !== false) {
  cb(aborted);
  abortCb && abortCb(aborted);
}
```
