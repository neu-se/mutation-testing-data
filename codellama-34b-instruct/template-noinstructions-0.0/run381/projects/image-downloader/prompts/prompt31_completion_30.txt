  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with a parameter of 10 would remove the first 10 characters from the URL, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight` method with a parameter of 10 would remove the last 10 characters from the URL, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method with a parameter of 10 would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the 10th character.

DONE.
