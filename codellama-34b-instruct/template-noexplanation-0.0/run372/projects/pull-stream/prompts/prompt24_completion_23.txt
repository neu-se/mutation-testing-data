  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This change will cause the `switch` statement to fall through to the `default` case, which will result in the `ref.unshift(read)` line being executed, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This change will cause the `switch` statement to fall through to the `default` case, which will result in the `ref.unshift(read)` line being executed, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This change will cause the `switch` statement to fall through to the `default` case, which will result in the `ref.unshift(read)` line being executed, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
