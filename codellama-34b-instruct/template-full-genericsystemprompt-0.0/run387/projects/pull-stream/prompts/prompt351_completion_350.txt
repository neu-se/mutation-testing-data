  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `test` function with the `data` argument, which is not the same as calling the `test` function without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `test` function with two arguments, which is not the same as calling the `test` function with one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `test` function with three arguments, which is not the same as calling the `test` function with one argument.

DONE.
