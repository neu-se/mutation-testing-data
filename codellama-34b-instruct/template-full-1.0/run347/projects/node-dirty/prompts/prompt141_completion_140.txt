  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'join'
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` is a method that concatenates all the elements of an array into a string, whereas `'error'` is a string literal that represents the name of an event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'drain'` is an event that is emitted when the `Writable` stream's internal buffer is empty, whereas `'error'` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'finish'` is an event that is emitted when the `Writable` stream has finished writing all the data, whereas `'error'` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs.

DONE.
