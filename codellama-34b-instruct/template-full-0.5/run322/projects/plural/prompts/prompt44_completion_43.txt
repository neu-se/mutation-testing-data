  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment subtracts 3. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "us" to be incorrect, such as "bus" becoming "buss" instead of "buses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment subtracts 4. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "us" to be incorrect, such as "bus" becoming "buss" instead of "buses".
