  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to use the HTTPS protocol instead of the HTTP protocol, which could cause issues if the website does not support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http://" prefix from the URL, which could cause issues if the website does not support relative URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to use the FTP protocol instead of the HTTP protocol, which could cause issues if the website does not support FTP.

DONE.
