Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the imaginary part is not equal to zero, which would lead to a different execution path in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the real part is less than zero, potentially altering the logic for when the function returns a specific complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the real part is exactly one, which would affect the flow of the function and the resulting complex number returned.

DONE.
