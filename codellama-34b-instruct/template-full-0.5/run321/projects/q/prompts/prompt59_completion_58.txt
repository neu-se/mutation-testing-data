  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && window
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the expression to return `window` instead of `true` or `false`, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || window
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the expression to return `true` if `window` is defined, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would cause the expression to return `window` if it is defined, and `false` otherwise, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code.

DONE.
