  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite. This change would cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` in more cases, which could lead to unexpected results in the application.

DONE.
