  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and would therefore cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with a `null` error argument, which would then be passed through to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with a `false` error argument, which would then be passed through to the `cb` function.

DONE.
