  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b + 1` returns a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a + b` returns a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a - b` returns a different value.

DONE.
