 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` function would return `true` for the `'re'` and `'im'` properties, causing the function to return `undefined` instead of a new `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the object property access `z['re']` would result in a `TypeError` when `z` is `null`, causing the function to terminate prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0 / 0
