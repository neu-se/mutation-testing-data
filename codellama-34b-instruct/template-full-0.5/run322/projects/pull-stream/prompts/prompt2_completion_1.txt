  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinks` is a different object than `sources`, and the code is using `sources` to iterate over the keys and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because `throughs` is a different object than `sources`, and the code is using `sources` to iterate over the keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exports
```
This would result in different behavior because `exports` is a different object than `sources`, and the code is using `sources` to iterate over the keys and values.

DONE.
