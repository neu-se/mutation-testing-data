 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends './' to the targetFilePath, which might cause issues if the path is already absolute or if the './' is not desired.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd() + '/' + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends the current working directory to the targetFilePath, which might cause issues if the path is already absolute or if the developer doesn't expect this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./target/' + targetFilePath
