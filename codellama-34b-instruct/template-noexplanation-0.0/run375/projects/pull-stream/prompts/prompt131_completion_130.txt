  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This change will cause the function to decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This change will cause the function to increment the `i` variable by 2 instead of 1, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = max
```
This change will cause the function to set the `i` variable to the `max` value instead of incrementing it, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
