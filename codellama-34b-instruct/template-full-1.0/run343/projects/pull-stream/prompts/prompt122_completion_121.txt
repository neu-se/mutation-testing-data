  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a stream object, but `null` will cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a stream object, but `{}` is an empty object without the necessary methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a stream object, but `false` is not a stream object at all.

DONE.
