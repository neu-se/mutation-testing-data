  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof process` would return "undefined", which would evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextTick` function to be assigned to `setTimeout` instead of `process.nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() !== "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString()` would return a different string than "[object process]", which would cause the `nextTick` function to be assigned to `setTimeout` instead of `process.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` would be `undefined`, which would cause the `nextTick` function to be assigned to `setTimeout` instead of `process.nextTick`.

DONE.
