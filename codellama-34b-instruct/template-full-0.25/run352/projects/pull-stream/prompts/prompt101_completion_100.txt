  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `err` is `false`, instead of `err` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `err` is not `true`, instead of `err` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `err` is truthy, instead of `err` itself.

DONE.
