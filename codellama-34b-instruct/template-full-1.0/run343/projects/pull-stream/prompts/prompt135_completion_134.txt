  A possible solution is to use a different operator than cb for error handling. The error function now ignores the abort argument and does not pass the error to the callback. This would result in different behavior because the abort argument would not be handled correctly.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the cb function adds a handler to the error event if the error should occur.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because abort is a function that will be called to handle the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because the process will terminates with error if an error occurred.

DONE.
