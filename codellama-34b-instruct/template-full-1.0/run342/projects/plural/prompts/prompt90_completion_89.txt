  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule("chilli", "chillis")
```
This would result in a different output because the given word "chilli" does not match the regular expression "^(?:wo)?man$" in the last rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/chilli/i, "chillis")
```
This would result in a different output because the regular expression "/chilli/i" matches the word "chilli", but the replacement string "chillis" does not match the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule("chilli", /chillis/)
```
This would result in a different output because the replacement string "chillis" is a regular expression instead of a string.

DONE.
