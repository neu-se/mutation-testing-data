 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `x === y` would now always be falsy, since `x` is an object and `0` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `x === y` would now always be falsy, since `x` is an object and `null` is an object with no properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
