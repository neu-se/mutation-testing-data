  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content = content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.substring(1)` would remove the first character of the content, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content = content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toLowerCase()` would convert the content to lowercase, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content = content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.split('').reverse().join('')` would reverse the order of the content, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

DONE.
