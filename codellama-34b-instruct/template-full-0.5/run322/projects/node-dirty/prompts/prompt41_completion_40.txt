  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of the expected value, which could cause errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of the expected value, which could cause errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a random key instead of the expected value, which could cause errors in the application.

DONE.
