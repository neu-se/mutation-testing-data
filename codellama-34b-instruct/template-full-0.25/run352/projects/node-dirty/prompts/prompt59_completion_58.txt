  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `close` method on the `this._writeStream` object, which is not the same as the `this` object that is passed as an argument to the `close` method in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `close` method on the `this._readStream` object, which is not the same as the `this` object that is passed as an argument to the `close` method in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream.end());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `end` method on the `this._writeStream` object, which would cause the stream to be closed and the `close` event to be emitted, but it would
