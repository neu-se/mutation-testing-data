  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffsetStr: getOffsetStr((utcOffset + dstOffset) * 2),
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `getOffsetStr()` function to the sum of `utcOffset` and `dstOffset`, instead of the correct value `dstOffset`. This would cause the `dstOffsetStr` property to be incorrect, potentially leading to errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffsetStr: getOffsetStr(dstOffset * 2),
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `getOffsetStr()` function to twice the value of `dstOffset`, instead of the correct value `dstOffset`. This would cause the `dstOffsetStr` property to be twice as large as it should be, potentially leading to errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffsetStr: getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset),
```
