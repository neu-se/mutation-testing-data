Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the imaginary part is positive instead of negative, leading to an incorrect sign being applied to the imaginary part in the string representation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only negate the imaginary part if it is exactly 1, which is not the intended logic of negating when the imaginary part is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the real part of the complex number to determine the sign of the imaginary part, which is not relevant to the condition being checked.

DONE.
