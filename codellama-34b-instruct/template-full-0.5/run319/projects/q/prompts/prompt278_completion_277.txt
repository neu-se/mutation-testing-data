  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `self.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.notify` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `self.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.resolve(new Error())` would cause the promise to be resolved with an error, whereas `self.resolve` would cause it to be resolved with a value.

DONE.
