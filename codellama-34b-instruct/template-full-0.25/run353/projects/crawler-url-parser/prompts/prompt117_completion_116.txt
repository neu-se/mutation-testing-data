  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is being called with the arguments `linkurl` and `pageurl` in the opposite order than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(pageurl, linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is being called with the arguments `pageurl` and `linkurl` in the opposite order than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is being called with the same argument `linkurl` twice, which would cause the function to return the same value for both the `linkurl` and `pageurl` arguments.

DONE.
