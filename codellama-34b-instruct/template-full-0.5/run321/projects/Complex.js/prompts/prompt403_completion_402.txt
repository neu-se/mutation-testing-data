  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number before using it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number before using it.

DONE.
