Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach((op, index) => { if (index % 2 === 0) predicate(op, index); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it only calls the predicate function for every even index, potentially skipping operations at odd indices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach((op, index) => { predicate(op, index + 1); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the index passed to the predicate function, causing it to reference the next index instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the context of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach((op, index) => { predicate(op, 0); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `0` as the index to the predicate function, meaning that the index information is lost and all operations are treated as if they are at the same index.

DONE.
