 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the real part of the complex number and always returns the same value for the real part of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part for the result's real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random value for the real part of the result instead of the actual real part of the complex number.

DONE.
