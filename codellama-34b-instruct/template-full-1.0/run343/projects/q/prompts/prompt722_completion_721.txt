  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state == "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject all promises instead of resolving them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice([promise], 1)[0].inspect().state == "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second element of an array of promises, whereas the original code considers all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fulfill().state == "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject promises that are fulfilled, whereas the original code does not do this.

DONE.
