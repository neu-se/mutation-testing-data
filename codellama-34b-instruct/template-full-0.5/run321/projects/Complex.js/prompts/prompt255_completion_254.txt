  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by a different value than `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + 1) * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to `a` before multiplying it by `b`.

DONE.
