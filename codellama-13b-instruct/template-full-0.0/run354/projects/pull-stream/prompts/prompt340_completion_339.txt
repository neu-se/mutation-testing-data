  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property is not defined on the `data` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property is not defined on the `data` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key.value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` property is not defined on the `data` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
