  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `promise` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected, potentially triggering any callbacks or error handlers that have been registered with the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called twice on the `promise` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected twice, potentially triggering any callbacks or error handlers that have been registered with the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called three times on the `prom
