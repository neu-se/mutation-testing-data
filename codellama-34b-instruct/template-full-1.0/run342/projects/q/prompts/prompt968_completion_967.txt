  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so `deferred.reject` would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so `deferred.reject` would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object, so `deferred.reject` would be called with an object as the first argument, which would cause an error.

DONE.
