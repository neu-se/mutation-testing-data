  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments, 2` would pass the second and third arguments to `nodeArgs`, while the modified code fragment `arguments, 1` would only pass the second argument to `nodeArgs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments, 2` would pass the second and third arguments to `nodeArgs`, while the modified code fragment `arguments, 3` would pass the third, fourth, and fifth arguments to `nodeArgs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments, 2` would pass the second and third arguments to `nodeArgs`, while the modified code fragment `arguments, 0` would pass no arguments to `nodeArgs`.

DONE.
