  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a function that returns the hostname of the URL, whereas `host` is a property that returns the hostname and the port number of the URL. By using `hostname` instead of `host`, the result of the comparison will be affected by the presence of a port number in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.protocol == linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `protocol` is a property that returns the protocol of the URL, whereas `host` is a property that returns the hostname and the port number of the URL. By using `protocol` instead of `host`, the result of the comparison will be affected by the presence of a protocol in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.port == linkurl.port
```
This would result in different behavior because `port` is a property that returns
