  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `thisOp.attributes`, and it would cause the `diff` function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.attributes`, and it would cause the `diff` function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `thisOp.attributes` or `otherOp.attributes`, and it would cause the `diff` function to produce a different output.

DONE.
