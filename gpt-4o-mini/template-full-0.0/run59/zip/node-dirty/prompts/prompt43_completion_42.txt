Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the parameters passed to the function `fn`, which may lead to incorrect processing of the key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the value with `null`, which may cause the function `fn` to behave differently if it expects a valid value instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `undefined` as the second argument, which may lead to different handling in the `fn` function if it checks for the presence of a value.

DONE.
