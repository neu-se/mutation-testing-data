  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the word "woman" correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o$/, 'es') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the word "woman" correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o$/, 's') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the word "woman" correctly.

DONE.
