  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This change will cause the `put` method to always resolve the promise, even if the queue is closed. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the `get` method, which assumes that the promise will be rejected if the queue is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This change will cause the `put` method to always reject the promise, even if the queue is not closed. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the `get` method, which assumes that the promise will be resolved if the queue is not closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
```
This change will cause the `put` method to create a new deferred object and resolve it, even if the queue is closed. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the `get` method, which assumes that the promise will be rejected if the queue is closed.

DONE.
