  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that accepts a callback function to be called when the promise is fulfilled, while `spread` is a method that spreads the values of a resolved promise into an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, while `spread` is a method that spreads the values of a resolved promise into an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason, while `spread` is a method that spreads the values of a resolved promise into an array.

DONE.
