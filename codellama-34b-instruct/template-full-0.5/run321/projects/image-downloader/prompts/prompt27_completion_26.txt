  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the URL used for the request, which could potentially cause the request to fail or return different data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the destination path for the downloaded file, which could potentially cause the file to be saved in the wrong location or with the wrong name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url + '?foo=bar'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a query parameter to the URL, which could potentially cause the server to return different data or respond differently to the request.

DONE.
