  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the delete count would cause the filter function to return a different result when the predicate is applied to the element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the delete count would cause the filter function to return a different result when the predicate is applied to the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 to the delete count would cause the filter function to return a different result when the predicate is applied to the element.

DONE.
