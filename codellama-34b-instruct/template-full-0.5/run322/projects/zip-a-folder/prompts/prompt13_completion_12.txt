  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new string that is a substring of the original `src` string, starting from the second character. This would cause the `access` method to check the accessibility of a different file or directory, which may or may not exist, and may or may not have different permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new string that is all uppercase, regardless of the original case of the `src` string. This would cause the `access` method to check the accessibility of a different file or directory, which may or may not exist, and may or may not have different permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new string that is the last component of the `src` string, separated by the `/
