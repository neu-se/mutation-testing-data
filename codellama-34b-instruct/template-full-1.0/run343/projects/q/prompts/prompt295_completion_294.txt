  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `undefined`, the `become` function would not be called with a promise, which would cause the deferred promise to become stuck in the pending state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("example error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because when the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with a new error object, the `become` function would be called with a rejected promise, which would cause the deferred promise to become rejected with the same error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `null`, the `become` function would be called with a fulfilled promise, which would cause the deferred promise to become fulfilled with `null`.

DONE.
