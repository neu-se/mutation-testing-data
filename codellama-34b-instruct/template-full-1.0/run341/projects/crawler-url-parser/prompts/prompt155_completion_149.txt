  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to replace the last part of the link URL, while the replacement code fragment uses the number 1. The empty string would have matched any string, while the number 1 would only match a string that contains the digit 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to replace the last part of the link URL, while the replacement code fragment uses the null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to replace the last part of the link URL, while the replacement code fragment uses a function that returns the number 1. The empty string would have matched any string, while the
