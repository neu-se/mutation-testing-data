  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a different substring than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -3
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a different substring than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -4
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a different substring than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the original behavior.

DONE.
