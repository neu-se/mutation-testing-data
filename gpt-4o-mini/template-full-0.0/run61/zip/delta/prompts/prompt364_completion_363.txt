Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue processing when the next operation in `otherIter` is a delete, potentially skipping over important operations that should be retained or inserted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the loop prematurely if there are no more operations in `thisIter`, ignoring any remaining operations in `otherIter`, which could lead to loss of data that should have been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only process the loop if the next operation in `thisIter` is a retain, which could lead to ignoring insert and delete operations, resulting in an incorrect transformation of the delta.

DONE.
