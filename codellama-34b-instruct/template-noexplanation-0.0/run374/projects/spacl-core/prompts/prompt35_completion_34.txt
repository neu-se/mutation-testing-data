  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to return a different regular expression, which may or may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(p => p.toUpperCase())
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to return a different regular expression, which may or may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().filter(p => p.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/))
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to return a different regular expression, which may or may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
