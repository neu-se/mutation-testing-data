  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume()` method is called on the `res` object, which would cause the response to be consumed and the `close` event to be emitted, even if the status code is not 200.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume()` method is called with the `true` argument, which would cause the response to be consumed and the `close` event to be emitted, even if the status code is not 200.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume()` method is called with the `false` argument, which would cause the response to be paused and the `close` event to be emitted, even if the status code is not 200.
