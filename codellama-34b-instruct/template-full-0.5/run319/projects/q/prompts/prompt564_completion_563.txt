  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a reserved word in JavaScript, and using it as a function name would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `reject` is a variable that may or may not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `reject` is a variable that may or may not be defined.

DONE.
