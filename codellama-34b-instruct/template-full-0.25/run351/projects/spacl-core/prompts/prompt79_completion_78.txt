  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `matches` method, causing the `for` loop to terminate early if the rule matches the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would cause the `for` loop to terminate early if the rule matches the path, but the `matches` method would still be called for each rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` would cause the `for` loop to terminate early if the rule matches the path, but the `matches` method would still be called for each rule.

DONE.
