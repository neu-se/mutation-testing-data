  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that immediately throws an exception, whereas the original code fragment `throw e;` only re-throws the same exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` throws a new error object, whereas the original code fragment `throw e;` re-throws the same error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Oops!");
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("Oops!")` throws a new error object with a custom message, whereas the original code fragment `throw e;` re-throws the same error object.

DONE.
