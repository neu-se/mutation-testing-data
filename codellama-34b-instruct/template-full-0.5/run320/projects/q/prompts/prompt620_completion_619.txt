  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a promise that resolves to the value of the property, while this new code returns a promise that resolves to the value passed as the second argument to the `set` method, which may not be the same as the value of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).then(function () {
    return key;
