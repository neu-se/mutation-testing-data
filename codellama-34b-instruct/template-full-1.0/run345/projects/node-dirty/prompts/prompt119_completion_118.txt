  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to check if the queue is empty, but this new code fragment checks if the queue is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to check if the queue is empty, but this new code fragment checks if the queue is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `size` property to check if the queue is empty, but this new code fragment uses the `length` property.

DONE.
