 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to `null`, regardless of the original deferred's resolution value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be rejected with the error message 'Error', regardless of the original deferred's resolution value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would not be resolved or rejected based on the original deferred's state, but rather on the state of the original promise itself. This could lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the original promise is still pending or has been rejected.

DONE.
