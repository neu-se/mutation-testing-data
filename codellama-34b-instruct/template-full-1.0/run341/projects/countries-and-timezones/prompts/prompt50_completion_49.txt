  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the actual timezone object with null, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return null instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    memoizeTimezone(data.timezones.UTC);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the actual timezone object with a different timezone object, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different timezone object than the one expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    memoizeTimezone(buildTimezone(data, 'Invalid Timezone'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the actual timezone object with a timezone object that doesn't exist in the data, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return null instead of the expected timezone object.

DONE.
