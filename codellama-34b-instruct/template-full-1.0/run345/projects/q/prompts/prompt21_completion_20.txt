  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mutate the task property of the `head` object, which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mutate the `head` object itself, which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mutate the `next` property of the `tail` object, which is not the intention of the original code.

DONE.
