  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if there are no more operations in the `otherIter` iterator, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if the length of the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator is zero, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator is a deletion, leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
