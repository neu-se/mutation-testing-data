  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` simply calls the `cb` function with `null` and `data` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, while the new code fragment `cb(err, data)` calls the `cb` function with `err` and `data` as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` argument, while the new code fragment `cb(null, null)`
