  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, causing the `all` function to resolve immediately with an empty array, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with a single element, causing the `all` function to resolve immediately with an array containing the single element, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with two elements, causing the `all` function to resolve immediately with an array containing the two elements, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.

DONE.
