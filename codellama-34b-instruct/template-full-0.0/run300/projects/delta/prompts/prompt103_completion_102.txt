  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first two elements of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
