  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `\n` character to indicate a new line, while the replaced code uses the `\r\n` sequence, which is the Windows-style newline character. This could cause issues if the code is run on a system that expects the Unix-style newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `\n` character to indicate a new line, while the replaced code uses the `\\n` sequence, which is a string literal representing the `\n` character. This could cause issues if the code is run on a system that expects the `\n` character to be interpreted as a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `\n` character to indicate a new line, while the replaced code uses a space character, which would
