  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is a truthy value, while `0` is a falsy value. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed, which would result in a different outcome.
