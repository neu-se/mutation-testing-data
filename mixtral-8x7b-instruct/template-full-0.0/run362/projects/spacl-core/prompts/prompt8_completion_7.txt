 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.match('//') !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact string '//' instead of a regular expression with the '/' delimiter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/\/\//g.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the '//' pattern exists in the spec string, but it doesn't check for empty segments since the 'g' flag makes it search for all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.includes('//')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string '//' is part of the spec, but it doesn't check for empty segments since it only checks for substring inclusion.

DONE.
