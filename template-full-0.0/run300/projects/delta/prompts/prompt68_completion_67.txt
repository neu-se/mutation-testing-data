  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied to one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied to one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied to twice as many characters as intended.

DONE.
