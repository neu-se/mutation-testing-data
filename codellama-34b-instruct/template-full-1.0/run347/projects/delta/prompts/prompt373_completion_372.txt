  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two elements in the iterator, potentially altering the behavior of the algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator back one element, potentially altering the behavior of the algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.prev(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator back two elements, potentially altering the behavior of the algorithm.

DONE.
