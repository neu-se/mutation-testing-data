  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, so it would not have a `task` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, so it would not have a `task` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ task: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` property would be an object with a `null` value, which is different from the original code where `task` was a function.

DONE.
