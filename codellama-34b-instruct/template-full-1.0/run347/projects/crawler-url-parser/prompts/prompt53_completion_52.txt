  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because "baseUrlStr" and "currentUrlStr" would have different values, and the function would return different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the parsed URL might have a different path than the current URL, and the function would return different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(parsedBaseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because "parse" would have been called with a different argument, and the function would return different results.

DONE.
