 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'str'.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in `_has_illegal_chars` is case-sensitive, and this change would convert the input to lowercase before testing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'[^a-z0-9\\:/\\?#\\[\\]@!$&'()*+,;=.\\-_~%]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslashes in the regular expression are escaped, which changes the set of characters matched by the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
document.location.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `document.location.href` is a property of the `document` object in a browser environment, and it may not be defined or have the expected value in other environments.

DONE.
