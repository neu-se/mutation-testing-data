  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This code fragment will clear the entire queue, which is different from the original code fragment that only deletes the key-value pair from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This code fragment will set the value for the given key to null, which is different from the original code fragment that deletes the key-value pair from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key);
```
This code fragment will delete the key-value pair from the queue, which is the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
