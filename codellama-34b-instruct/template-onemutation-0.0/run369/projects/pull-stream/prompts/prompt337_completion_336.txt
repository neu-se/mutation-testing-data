  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.toString()` returns a string representation of the `prop` object, whereas `prop` by itself returns the object. This change would cause the `field` function to receive a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the `filter` function.

DONE.
