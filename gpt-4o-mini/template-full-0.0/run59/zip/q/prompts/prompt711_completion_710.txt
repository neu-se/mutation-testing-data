Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to request the values of the properties of the object instead of the keys, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to dispatch a request for the "length" property of the object, which is not a valid operation for retrieving the keys of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getOwnPropertyNames"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly suggest that the method should retrieve property names using a method that is not defined in the context of the dispatch, leading to potential runtime errors.

DONE.
