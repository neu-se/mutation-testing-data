  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not set any value for the key, and the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value of the key to `null`, and the `get` method would return `null` instead of the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value of the key to the string `'key'`, and the `get` method would return the string `'key'` instead of the actual value.

DONE.
