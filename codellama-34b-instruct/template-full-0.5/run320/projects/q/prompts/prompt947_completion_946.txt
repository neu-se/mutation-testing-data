  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeNodeResolver` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `nodeArgs.push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `resolve` function as an argument to `nodeArgs.push`, rather than the `makeNodeResolver` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as an argument to `nodeArgs.push`, rather than the `makeNodeResolver` function.

DONE.
