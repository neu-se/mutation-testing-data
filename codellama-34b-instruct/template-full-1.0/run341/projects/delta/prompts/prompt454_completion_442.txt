  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return true, even when the offset is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset < Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return false, even when the offset is equal to infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset + 1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return true, even when the offset is not equal to zero.

DONE.
