  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the angle instead of the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tangent of the angle instead of the sine.

DONE.
