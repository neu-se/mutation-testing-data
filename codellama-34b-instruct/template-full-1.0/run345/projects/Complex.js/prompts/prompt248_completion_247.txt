  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` performs a exponentiation function, whereas `Math.expm1` performs the same calculation while subtracting 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinm1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinm1` calculates the sine of its argument while subtracting 1, whereas `Math.expm1` calculates the exponent while subtracting 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosm1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosm1` calculates the cosine of its argument while subtracting 1, whereas `Math.expm1` calculates the exponent while subtracting 1.

DONE.
