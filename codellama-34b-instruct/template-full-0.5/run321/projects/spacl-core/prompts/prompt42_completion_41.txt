  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.length` would return the length of the `part` string, whereas `part` would return the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)` would return a `RegExpMatchArray` object if the `part` string matches the regular expression, whereas `part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null` would return `true` if the `part` string does not match the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0' ? /[*+
