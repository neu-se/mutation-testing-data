  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `θ` variable, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is multiplied by 2, which would double the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable is multiplied by 0, which would result in a bearing of 0 degrees, regardless of the direction of the bearing.

DONE.
