 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newOp.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if `newOp.attributes` is falsy, instead of throwing an error. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `lastOp.attributes` instead of `newOp.attributes`, potentially causing issues if the two objects have different properties or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any>null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `newOp.attributes` with `null`, which is a different object and could cause issues in the code that uses this value.

DONE.
