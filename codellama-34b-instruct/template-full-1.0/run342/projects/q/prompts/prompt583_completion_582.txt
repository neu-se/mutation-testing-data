  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because errback is a function that handles errors, and in the original code, it is not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because reject is a function that returns a rejected promise, while callback is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.resolve is a function that resolves a deferred promise, while callback is a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
