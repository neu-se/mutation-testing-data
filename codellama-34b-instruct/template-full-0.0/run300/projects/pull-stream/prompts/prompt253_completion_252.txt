  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream, whereas `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, stream) {
  if(end)
    return cb(end)
  if(stream && 'object' === typeof stream)
    stream = values(stream)
  else if ('function' !== typeof stream)
    stream = once(stream)
  _read = stream
  nextChunk()
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the
