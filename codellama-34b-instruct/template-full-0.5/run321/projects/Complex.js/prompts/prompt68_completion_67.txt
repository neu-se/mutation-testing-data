  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument, which would cause it to throw a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a string argument, which would cause it to throw a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` function would be called with a string argument, which would cause it to log a different error message to the console.

DONE.
