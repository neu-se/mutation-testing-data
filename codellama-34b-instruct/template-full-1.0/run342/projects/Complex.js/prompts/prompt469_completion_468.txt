  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if b is less than 0, but the new code fragment checks if b is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if b is less than 0, but the new code fragment checks if the negation of b is true, which is the same as checking if b is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if b is less than 0, but the new code fragment always returns true, regardless of the value of b.

DONE.
