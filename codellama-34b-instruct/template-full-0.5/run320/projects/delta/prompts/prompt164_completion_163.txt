  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to treat a retain operation as a delete operation, which would result in the wrong output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to treat a retain operation as an insert operation, which would result in the wrong output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to treat a delete operation as a retain operation, which would result in the wrong output.

DONE.
