  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promise` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and would therefore cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.source` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and would therefore cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different function than `resolve`, and would therefore cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
