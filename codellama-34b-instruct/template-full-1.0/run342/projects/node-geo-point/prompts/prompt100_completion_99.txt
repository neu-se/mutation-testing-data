  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 hoch2 och
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert from radians to degrees, but the new fragment uses the `hoch2och` function, which is not a valid function and would result in a syntax error. Therefore, this mutation would cause the code to fail to compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert from radians to degrees, but the new fragment uses the `-rad2deg` function, which is a valid function but has a different behavior. Specifically, it would negate the angle before converting it to degrees, which would result in a different final angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert from radians to degrees, but the
