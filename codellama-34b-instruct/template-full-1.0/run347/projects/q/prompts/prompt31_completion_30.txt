  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method modifies the `laterQueue` array, removing the last element from the array. In the original code, the `laterQueue.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call seems to be used to retrieve the last element from the array without modifying it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method modifies the `laterQueue` array, removing the first element from the array. In the original code, the `laterQueue.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call seems to be used to retrieve the last element from the array without modifying it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the `laterQueue` array,
