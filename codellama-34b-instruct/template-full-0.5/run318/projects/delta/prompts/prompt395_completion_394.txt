  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different operation than `thisOp.delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different operation than `thisOp.delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is a different operation than `thisOp.delete`.

DONE.
