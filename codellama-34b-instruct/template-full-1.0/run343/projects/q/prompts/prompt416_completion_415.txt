  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then()` would return a new promise that resolves with the original promise, whereas `object` would return the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.catch()` would catch any errors that occur within the promise chain, whereas `object` would let the errors propagate up the chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.finally()` would execute the code in the current method once the promise chain is settled, whereas `object` would execute the code immediately.

DONE.
