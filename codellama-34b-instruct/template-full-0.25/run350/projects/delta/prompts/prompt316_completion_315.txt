  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be increased by 1, which could cause the code to skip over a necessary operation or perform an operation on the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decreased by 1, which could cause the code to skip over a necessary operation or perform an operation on the wrong data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which could cause the code to perform the operation twice on the same data or skip over a necessary operation.

DONE.
