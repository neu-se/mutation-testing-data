 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.hasNext() || otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check for `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` even when `thisIter` has a next element, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.hasNext() || thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
