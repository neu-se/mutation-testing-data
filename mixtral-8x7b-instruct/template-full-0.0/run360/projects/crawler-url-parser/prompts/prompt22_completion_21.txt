 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from http to https, which might not be the desired behavior for certain use cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the protocol entirely, which could lead to unexpected results when resolving relative URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, 'http:/'
