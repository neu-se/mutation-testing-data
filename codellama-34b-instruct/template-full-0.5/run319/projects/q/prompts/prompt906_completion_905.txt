  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is `undefined`, but this replacement code fragment checks if `callback` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is a function, but this replacement code fragment checks if `callback` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is `undefined`, but this replacement code fragment checks if `callback` has a non-zero length.

DONE.
