  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns the value of `a` to `z['im']`, while this replacement assigns the value `1` to `z['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns the value of `a` to `z['re']`, while this replacement assigns the value of `b` to `z['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns the value of `a` to `z['im']`, while this replacement assigns the value of `b` to `z['im']`.

DONE.
