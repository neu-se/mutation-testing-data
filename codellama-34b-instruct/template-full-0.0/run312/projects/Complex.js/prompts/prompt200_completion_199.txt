  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the resulting expression would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `b`, and the resulting expression would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because `d` is a different variable than `b`, and the resulting expression would be different.

DONE.
