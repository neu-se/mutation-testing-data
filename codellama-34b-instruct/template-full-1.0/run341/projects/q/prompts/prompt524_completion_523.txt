  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the constant `12345` instead of the original `object`, which could cause unexpected results in the program's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the `object` variable, which could cause unexpected results in the program's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `object` array, which could cause unexpected results in the program's execution.

DONE
