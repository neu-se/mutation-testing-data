  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` quantifier matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character class, whereas the `*` quantifier matches zero or more occurrences. This means that the new regex would require at least one character to be present in the string, whereas the original regex would allow for an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]{0}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{0}` quantifier specifies that the preceding character class must not match any characters in the string. This means that the new regex would only match an empty string, whereas the original regex would match any string that contains only the specified characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*
