  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be off by one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses would cause the `+ 1` to be applied to the entire expression, rather than just the `c` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c + 1) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be twice as large as it should be.

DONE.
