 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, while `concat` returns a new array containing the joined arrays. In this case, it would cause `nodeArgs` to have a different value than the original implementation, potentially causing issues downstream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` modifies the original array instead of creating a new one. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the `nodeArgs` array, potentially causing issues when passed to `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of the array instead of concatenating arrays at the end. This would cause the order of arguments passed to `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)` to be
