  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData` is now a constant and cannot be reassigned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let transformedData = typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null ? otherData : length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `transformedData` is now a variable and can be reassigned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const transformedData = typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null ? otherData : length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `transformedData` is now a constant and cannot be reassigned.

DONE.
