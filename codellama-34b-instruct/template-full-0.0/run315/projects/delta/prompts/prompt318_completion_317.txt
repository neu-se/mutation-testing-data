  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number, but the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the `invert` method to behave differently when it encounters a retain operation with a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number or a string, but the new code fragment checks if it is an object and has attributes. This could cause the `invert` method to behave differently when it encounters a retain operation with an object value that has attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is
