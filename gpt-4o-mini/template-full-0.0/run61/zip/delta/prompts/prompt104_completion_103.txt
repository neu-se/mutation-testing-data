Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out all operations that pass the predicate, returning only those that fail, which is the opposite of the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include operations that pass the predicate and are at even indices, potentially omitting valid operations that are at odd indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index by 1 when calling the predicate, potentially causing it to evaluate against the wrong index and leading to incorrect filtering of operations.

DONE.
