  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `slice` method would be negative, which would cause the method to extract the last two characters of the string instead of the first two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `slice` method would be positive, which would cause the method to extract the first two characters of the string instead of the last two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `slice` method would be one less than the original value, which would cause the method to extract one less character from the string.

DONE.
