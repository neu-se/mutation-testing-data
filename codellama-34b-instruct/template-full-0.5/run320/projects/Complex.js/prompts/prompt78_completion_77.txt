  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the second element instead of the first, skipping the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially accessing an element outside the bounds of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element, potentially missing some important data.

DONE.
