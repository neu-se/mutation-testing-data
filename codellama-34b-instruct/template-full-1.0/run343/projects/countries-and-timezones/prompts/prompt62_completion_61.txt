  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"INVALID"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of the `country` object, which could cause errors in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123456789
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a different `country` object, which could cause errors in the calling code if the object's properties or methods are not the same as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a different `country` object, which could cause errors in the calling code if the object's properties or methods are not the same as expected.

DONE.
