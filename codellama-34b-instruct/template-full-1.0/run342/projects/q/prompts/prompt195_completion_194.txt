  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the function name instead of the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the column number instead of the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next value in the stack trace instead of the line number.

DONE.
