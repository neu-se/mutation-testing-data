  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cos(φ1) * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` has been replaced with the division operator `/`, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(δ) + cos(φ1) * sin(δ) * cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` has been replaced with the addition operator `+`, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(δ) - cos(φ1) * sin(δ) * cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` has been replaced with the subtraction operator `-`, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

DONE.
