  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is changed to `end` which would cause the loop to continue even if `end` is true, and the `!` operator is removed from `test(data)` which would cause the loop to continue even if `test(data)` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed from `end` which would cause the loop to continue even if `end` is false, and the `||` operator is changed to `&&` which would cause the loop to continue even if `test(data)` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed from `test(data)` which would cause the loop to continue even if `test(data)` is false
