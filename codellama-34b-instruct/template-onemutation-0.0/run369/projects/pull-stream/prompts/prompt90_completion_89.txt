  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `test` function returns `true`. This would cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` and `null` as arguments, which is different from the original behavior where `cb` would be called with `null` and `data` as arguments if `test` returns `true`.
