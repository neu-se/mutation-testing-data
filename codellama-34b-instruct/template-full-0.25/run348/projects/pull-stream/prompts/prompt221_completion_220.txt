  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `null` is a literal value that represents the absence of any object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `{}` is an empty object literal that does not have any properties or methods.

DONE.
