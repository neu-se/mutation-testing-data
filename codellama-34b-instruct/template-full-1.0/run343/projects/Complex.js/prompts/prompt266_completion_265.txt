  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because a and b are swapped, which could cause the tangent function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because a and b are added together, which could cause the tangent function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because a and b are multiplied together, which could cause the tangent function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
