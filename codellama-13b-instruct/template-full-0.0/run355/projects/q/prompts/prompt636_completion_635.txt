  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error when attempting to access the `dispatch` property of the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to bind the `dispatch` method to the `Promise` object, allowing it to be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to call the `dispatch` method with the `this` context and the `arguments` object as arguments.

DONE.
