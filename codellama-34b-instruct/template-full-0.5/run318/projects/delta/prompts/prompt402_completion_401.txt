  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the `embedType` is equal to the second key in the `otherData` object, rather than the first key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the `embedType` is not equal to the first key in the `otherData` object, rather than checking if it is equal to the first key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the `embedType` is equal to the first key in the `otherData` object and the value of that key is `null`, rather than just checking if the `embedType` is equal to the first key
