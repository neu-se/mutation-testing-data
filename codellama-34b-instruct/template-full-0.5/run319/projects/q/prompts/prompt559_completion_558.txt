  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) || exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if `exception` is an instance of the `StopIteration` class, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) && exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `true` if `exception` is an instance of `StopIteration` and `exception.value` is truthy, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) || exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if `exception` is an instance of `StopIteration` or `exception.value` is truthy, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
