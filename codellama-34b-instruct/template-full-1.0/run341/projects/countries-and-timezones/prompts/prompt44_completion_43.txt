  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the input id, which would cause the tests for the `getCountry` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => Object.keys(data.countries).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the number of countries in the data object, regardless of the input id, which would cause the tests for the `getCountry` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => Object.keys(data.countries).reduce((prev, cur) => prev + cur, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the sum of the country ids in the data object, regardless of the input id, which would cause the tests for the `getCountry` function to fail.

DONE.
