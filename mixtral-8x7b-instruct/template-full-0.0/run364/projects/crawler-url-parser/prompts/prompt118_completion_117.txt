 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function does not handle the case where `linkurl` or `pageurl` is null, and it would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects `linkurl` and `pageurl` to have specific properties such as `host`, `path`, `subdomain`, etc. An empty object does not have these properties, and it would cause a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{url: 'example.com'}
