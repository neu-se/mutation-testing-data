  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute indefinitely, as the index would always be greater than the count.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, as the index would always be less than or equal to the count.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count <= index
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, as the count would always be less than or equal to the index.

DONE.
