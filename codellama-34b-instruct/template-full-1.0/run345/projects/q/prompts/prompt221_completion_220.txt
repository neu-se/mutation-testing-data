  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return nothing, which would cause errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a new error object, which could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return undefined, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly or throw errors.

DONE.
