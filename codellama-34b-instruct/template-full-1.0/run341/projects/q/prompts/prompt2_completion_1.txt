  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be called with an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with an empty object as an argument, which is likely to produce different results than the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be executed and would return undefined, which is likely to produce different results than the original behavior.

DONE.
