 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise` is the built-in constructor for promises, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a reference to the `Q.Promise` constructor. Using `Promise` instead of `<PLACEHOLDER>` could lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior if the built-in `Promise` constructor has different methods or behavior than the `Q.Promise` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because using an empty function as the constructor would not have the same behavior as the `<PLACEHOLDER>` constructor. The `Q.Promise` constructor has specific methods and behavior that are necessary for the proper functioning of the code. Using an empty function would result in a different object being created, which would likely cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
