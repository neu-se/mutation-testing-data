 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would not receive the correct line and attributes, as it would be called with an empty Delta object instead of the current line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '\n', attributes: {} }
