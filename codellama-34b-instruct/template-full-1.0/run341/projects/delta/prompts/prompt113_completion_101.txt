  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from an array, whereas `reduce` iterates over the elements of an array and returns a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `reduce` iterates over the elements of an array and returns a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in an array, whereas `reduce` iterates over the elements of an array and returns a single value.

DONE.
