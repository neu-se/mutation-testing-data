  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.value` is not a valid method for a regexp object, whereas `key.exec` is. Therefore, replacing `key.exec` with `key.value` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.test` is a valid method for a regexp object, but it would not produce the same results as `key.exec`. `key.test` returns a boolean value indicating whether the regular expression matches the given string, whereas `key.exec` returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.match` is a valid method for a regexp object, but it would not produce the same results as `key.exec`. `key.match` returns an array of matches, but it would also include
