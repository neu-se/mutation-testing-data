  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(test && false) || id`, which would always return `id` regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(test || false) && id`, which would always return `id` if `test` is truthy, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!test) && id`, which would always return `id` if `test` is falsy, and `false` otherwise.
