  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezone` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone !== name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezone` is not strictly equal to `name`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.hasOwnProperty(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezone` does not have a property with the name `name`.

DONE.
