  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 0 instead of 1, which could cause the loop to execute one extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, and would iterate backwards instead of forwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, since the condition is inclusive of the upper bound instead of exclusive.

DONE.
