  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` is a boolean value that is always truthy, whereas `!priority` is a boolean value that is always falsy. This means that the `if` statement that checks `!priority` will always evaluate to `false`, even if `priority` is `true`.
