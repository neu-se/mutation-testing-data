  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this._inFlightWrites` is less than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is less than 0. This change could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when `this._inFlightWrites` is negative.

DONE.
