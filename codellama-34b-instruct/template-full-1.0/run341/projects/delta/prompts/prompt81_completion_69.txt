  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes an element from the beginning of the array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0] = <newOp>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first element of the `ops` array with the new operation, rather than adding it to the end of the array as `unshift` would.

DONE.
