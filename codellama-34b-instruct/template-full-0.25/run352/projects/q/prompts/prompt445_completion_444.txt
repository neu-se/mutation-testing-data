  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not emit the "unhandledRejection" event, which is necessary for tracking unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not track unhandled rejections, but instead track rejections that have been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not provide the promise that was rejected, which is necessary for tracking unhandled rejections.

DONE.
