Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation from `thisOp` instead of the operation from `otherOp`, potentially altering the intended delta composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value into the delta instead of the actual operation from `otherOp`, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in subsequent operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the attributes of `otherOp` instead of the entire operation, which may not represent the intended operation in the delta and could lead to incorrect state representation.

DONE.
