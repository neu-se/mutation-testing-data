Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key) * 2

```javascript
this.get(key + 'x')
```
This would result in different behavior because the key passed to the `get` method would be the original key with 'x' appended to it. This could cause issues if the updated key does not
