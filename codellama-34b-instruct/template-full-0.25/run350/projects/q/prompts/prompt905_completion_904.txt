  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is used to pass arguments to the `callback` function, and replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is used to pass arguments to the `callback` function, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to receive no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is used to pass arguments to the `callback` function, and replacing it with an empty array `[]` would cause the function to receive no arguments.

DONE.
