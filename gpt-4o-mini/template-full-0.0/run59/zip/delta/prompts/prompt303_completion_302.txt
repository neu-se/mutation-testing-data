Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always return an empty operation, potentially skipping valid operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times instead of moving to the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always attempts to consume only one unit of the operation, which may not align with the actual length of the operation, leading to incorrect processing of the delta.

DONE.
