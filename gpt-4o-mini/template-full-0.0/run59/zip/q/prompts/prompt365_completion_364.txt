Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the promise to resolve multiple times if `done` is false, potentially leading to multiple calls to the rejection handler instead of ensuring that it is called only once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejection handler to never be called, as the condition would always evaluate to true, preventing any handling of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check the value of `exception` instead of the `done` flag, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise resolution process, potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject incorrectly based on the exception value.

DONE.
