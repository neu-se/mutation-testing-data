  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would return a different value, potentially causing the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would return a different value, potentially causing the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would return a different value, potentially causing the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the one intended.

DONE.
