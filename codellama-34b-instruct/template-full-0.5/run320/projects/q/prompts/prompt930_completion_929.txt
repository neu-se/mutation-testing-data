  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if (callback === undefined)` check would pass, and an error would be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a falsy value, so the `if (callback === undefined)` check would pass, and an error would be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if (callback === undefined)` check would pass, and an error would be thrown.

DONE.
