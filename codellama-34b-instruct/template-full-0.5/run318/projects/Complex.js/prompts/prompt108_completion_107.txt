  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(z['re']) && !isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if both are not NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === Infinity || z['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if either is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if both are 0.

DONE.
