  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not an object, and therefore `Object.keys(a)` would return an empty array, causing the `if` statement to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[0]` would return the first element of the `b` array, which is not necessarily the same as `Object.keys(b)[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[1]` would return the second element of the `b` array, which is not necessarily the same as `Object.keys(b)[0]`.

DONE.
