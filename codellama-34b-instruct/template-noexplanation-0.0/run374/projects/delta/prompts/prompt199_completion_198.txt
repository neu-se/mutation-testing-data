  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of `thisIter.rest` except for the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.filter(x => x !== thisIter.peek())
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of `thisIter.rest` except for the element that is equal to `thisIter.peek()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice(0, thisIter.peek())
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of `thisIter.rest` up to but not including the element that is equal to `thisIter.peek()`.

DONE.
