Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `linkurl` is `null`, which would return `true` for `null` values but not for other falsy values like `undefined` or an empty string, potentially leading to incorrect handling of valid string URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof linkurl === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `linkurl` is an object, which would incorrectly allow non-string objects to pass through, potentially causing errors later in the code that expects `linkurl` to be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `linkurl` has a length greater than 0, which would incorrectly allow non-string types (like arrays or objects) that have a `length` property, leading to unexpected results when processing URLs.

DONE.
