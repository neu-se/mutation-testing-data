  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter would be incremented by 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `splice` method to start at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp` object would be inserted at the wrong index, which would cause the `splice` method to insert the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp` object would be deleted at the wrong index, which would cause the `splice` method to delete the wrong value.

DONE.
