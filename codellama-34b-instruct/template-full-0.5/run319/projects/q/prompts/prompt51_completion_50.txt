  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `requestTick` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called with a `null` value, rather than being passed as a callback to the `nextTick` function.

DONE.
