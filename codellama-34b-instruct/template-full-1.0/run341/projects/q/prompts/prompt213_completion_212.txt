  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because if the value is a promise-like object, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and the `else` statement would not be executed. However, if the value is not a promise-like object, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, and the `else` statement would be executed, which would result in the `Coercion` error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the value has an `isPromise` property, and not if the value is actually a promise. If the value is a promise-like object, it may not have an `isPromise` property, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, resulting in the `Coercion` error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if
