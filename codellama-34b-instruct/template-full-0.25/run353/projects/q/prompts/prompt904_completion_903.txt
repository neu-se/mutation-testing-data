  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `fapply` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the context of the function call to `null`, which would cause the `fapply` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` changes the context of the function call to `null`, which would cause the `fapply` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

DONE.
