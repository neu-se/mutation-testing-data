  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 'bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and adding the string `'bug'` to it would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and calling the `toUpperCase()` method on it would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and calling the `substring()` method on it with an argument of 1 would result in a different string.

DONE.
