  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('This is a different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', 'This is a different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error event would be emitted with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('This is a different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown with a different message.

DONE.
