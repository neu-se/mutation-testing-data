  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the arguments and return value as separate arguments, whereas the replaced code fragment would pass all the arguments together with the return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the arguments and return value as separate arguments, whereas the replaced code fragment would pass only the return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the arguments and return value as separate arguments, whereas the replaced code fragment would pass the return value as the first argument and the rest as undefined.

DONE.
