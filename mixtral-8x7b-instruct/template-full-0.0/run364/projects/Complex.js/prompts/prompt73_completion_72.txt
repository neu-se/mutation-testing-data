 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Parsing error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of silently continuing, which would cause the `parse` function to terminate prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the imaginary part of the complex number to a constant value, instead of parsing it from the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the real part of the complex number to a non-number value, which could cause unexpected behavior in subsequent calculations.

DONE.
