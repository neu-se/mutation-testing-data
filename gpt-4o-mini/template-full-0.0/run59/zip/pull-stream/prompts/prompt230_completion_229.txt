Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original test condition, causing the filter to pass data that does not meet the original criteria, potentially leading to incorrect data being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the test to only allow `null` values, filtering out all other data types, which may not be the intended functionality of the original filter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.bind(null, 'unexpected')
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the `test` function to always receive the string `'unexpected'` as its first argument, which may lead to incorrect filtering based on a fixed value rather than the actual data being processed.

DONE.
