  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to be called with an invalid argument, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = otherIter.peekLength(thisIter.peek());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = otherIter.peekLength(otherIter.peek());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could potentially return a different value.

DONE.
