  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to be off by 180 degrees, which is a significant difference in the resulting destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to be double the original value, which will result in a destination point that is twice as far away from the starting point as it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to be off by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which will result in a destination point that is 180 degrees away from the starting point.

DONE.
