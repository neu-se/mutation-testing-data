  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `at` variable, which is used to keep track of the index of the `unhandledRejections` array. If `at` is decremented, the array index will be incorrect, and the promise will not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `at` variable, which is used to keep track of the index of the `unhandledRejections` array. If `at` is incremented, the array index will be incorrect, and the promise will not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `at` variable to 0, which is not the correct index of the promise in the
