  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would start from the index 0 instead of 1, leading to a different resulting substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would start from the index 1 instead of 0, leading to a different resulting substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(w.length - 2, 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would start from the last index of the string instead of the first, leading to a different resulting substring.

DONE.
