  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `drain` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `drain(null, done)` is a function call with two arguments, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(undefined, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `drain` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `drain(undefined, done)` is a function call with two arguments, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.
