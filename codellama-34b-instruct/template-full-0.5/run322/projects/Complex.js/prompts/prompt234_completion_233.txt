  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, which would in turn affect the `exp` and `expm1` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, which would in turn affect the `exp` and `expm1` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, which would in turn affect the `exp` and `expm1` functions.

DONE.
