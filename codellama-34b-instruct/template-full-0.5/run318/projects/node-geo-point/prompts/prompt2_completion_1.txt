  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the latitude to be equal to zero, which is not a valid value for a geographic coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the latitude to be equal to 90, which is not a valid value for a geographic coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === -90
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the latitude to be equal to -90, which is not a valid value for a geographic coordinate.

DONE.
