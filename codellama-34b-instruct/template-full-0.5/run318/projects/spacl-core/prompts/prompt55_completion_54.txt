  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$2')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string has a different number of capturing groups than the original, which could cause the regex to match or capture different parts of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string has a different number of capturing groups than the original, which could cause the regex to match or capture different parts of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$3')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string has a different number of capturing groups than the original, which could cause the regex to match or capture different parts of the input.

DONE.
