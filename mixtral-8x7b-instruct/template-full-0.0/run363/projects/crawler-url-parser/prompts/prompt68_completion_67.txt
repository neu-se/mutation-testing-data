 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a function that returns the `parse` function, instead of directly calling `parse`. This would cause the `extract` function to fail when trying to call the result of the PLACEHOLDER as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `extract` function to skip the processing of links, since the `baseUrl` variable would be set to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'notaparsefunction'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `parse` function with a string, causing the `extract` function to throw a TypeError when trying to call the PLACEHOLDER as a function.

DONE.
