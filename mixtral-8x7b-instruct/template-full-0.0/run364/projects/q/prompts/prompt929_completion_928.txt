 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor` may not refer to the `Q` object, and the `denodeify` method is expected to be a part of the `Q` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because assigning `null` to `this.denodeify` would remove the `denodeify` method from the `Q` prototype, causing errors in any code that relies on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
