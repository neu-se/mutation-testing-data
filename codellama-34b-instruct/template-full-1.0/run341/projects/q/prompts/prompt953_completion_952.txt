  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, whereas `fail` is a legitimate method in the Q library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that takes no arguments, whereas `fail()` is a method that takes an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a legitimate property of a promise in the Q library, whereas `fail` is a method that handles rejection of a promise.

DONE.
