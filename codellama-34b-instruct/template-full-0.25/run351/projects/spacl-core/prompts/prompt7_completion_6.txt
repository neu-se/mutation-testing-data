  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while this replacement checks if it does not contain consecutive slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while this replacement checks if the result of the match is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== null && spec.match(/\/\//).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while this replacement checks if the result of the match is not null and has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
