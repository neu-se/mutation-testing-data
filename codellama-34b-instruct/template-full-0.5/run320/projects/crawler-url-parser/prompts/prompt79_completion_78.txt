  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a' + 'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects links with an 'a' tag, while this new fragment would select links with an 'a' tag and a 'b' tag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a' + 'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects links with an 'a' tag, while this new fragment would select links with an 'a' tag and a 'c' tag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects links with an 'a' tag, while this new fragment would select links with a 'b' tag.

DONE.
