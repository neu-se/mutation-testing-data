  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is the opposite of `Q.reject`, and would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which would cause the promise to resolve with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and would cause the promise to resolve with a different value.

DONE.
