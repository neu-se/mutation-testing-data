 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes only the `end` parameter to the callback, while the modified version passes both `end` and `data`. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle both parameters correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `end` and `data` parameters to the callback, while the modified version passes a boolean value. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle boolean values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(test(data))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `end` parameter to the callback, while the modified version passes the result of the `test` function applied to the `data` parameter. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle the result of the
