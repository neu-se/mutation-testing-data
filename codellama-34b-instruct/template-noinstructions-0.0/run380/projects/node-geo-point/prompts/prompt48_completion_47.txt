  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(φ1)` is used to convert the latitude of the first point to radians, while the replacement code fragment `deg2rad(φ2)` is used to convert the latitude of the second point to radians. This would cause the bearing calculation to use different values for the latitudes of the two points, leading to a different bearing result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(φ1)` is used to convert the latitude of the first point to radians, while the replacement code fragment `rad2deg(φ2)` is used to convert the latitude of the second point to degrees. This would cause the bearing calculation to use different values for the latitudes of the two points, leading to a different bearing result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
