  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code always uses 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code always uses the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code always uses the negative of the imaginary part.

DONE.
