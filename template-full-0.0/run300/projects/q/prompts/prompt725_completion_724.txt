  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is a function, and calling it with `.state` would return the state of the promise, which is not the same as the original code fragment `promise.inspect`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is a function, and calling it with `.value` would return the value of the promise, which is not the same as the original code fragment `promise.inspect`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is a function, and calling it with `.reason` would return the reason for the promise's rejection, which is not the same as the original code fragment `promise.inspect`.

DONE.
