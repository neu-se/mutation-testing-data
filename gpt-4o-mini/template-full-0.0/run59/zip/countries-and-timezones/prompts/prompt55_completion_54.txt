Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to not receive any options, potentially leading to unexpected results when checking for deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ deprecated: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because providing an options object with `deprecated` set to `false` would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones, including those marked as deprecated, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ allTimezones: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an options object with a property `allTimezones` would not be recognized by the `deliverTimezones` function, leading to a situation where the function does not filter out deprecated timezones as expected.

DONE.
