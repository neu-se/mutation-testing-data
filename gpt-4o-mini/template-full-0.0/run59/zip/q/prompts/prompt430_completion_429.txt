Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the promise is in the "fulfilled" state instead of the "rejected" state, leading to false positives when determining if an object is a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending instead of rejected, which would cause the function to incorrectly identify pending promises as rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(object) && object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic to check if the promise is fulfilled instead of rejected, leading to incorrect results when determining if an object is a rejected promise.

DONE.
