 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last two characters of the word instead of removing the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the word instead of removing the last two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append "es" to the end of the word, regardless of the word's length.

DONE.
