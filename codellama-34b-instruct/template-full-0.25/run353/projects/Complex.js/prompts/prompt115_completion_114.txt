  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` as is, while this modified code fragment adds 1 to the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` as is, while this modified code fragment multiplies the value of `a` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` as is, while this modified code fragment subtracts 1 from the value of `a`.

DONE.
