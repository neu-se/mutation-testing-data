  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, but not if it is a NaN.

DONE.
