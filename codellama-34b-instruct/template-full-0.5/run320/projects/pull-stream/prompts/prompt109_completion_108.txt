  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc + data` would always return a new value, whereas `reducer` could potentially return a different value each time it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc * data` would always return a different value than `reducer`, even if `reducer` returned the same value each time it was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc - data` would always return a different value than `reducer`, even if `reducer` returned the same value each time it was called.

DONE.
