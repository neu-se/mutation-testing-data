  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `async` function immediately, rather than returning a function that can be called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `this` context of the `async` function to the current context, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `async` function immediately, with the current context as the `this` value, which could potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to be called in that way.

DONE.
