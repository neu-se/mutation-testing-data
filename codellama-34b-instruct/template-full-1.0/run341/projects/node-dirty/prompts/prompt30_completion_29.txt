  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be incremented by 1 before being used, which could cause the `get` method to return a different value than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of the value associated with the given key, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be treated as a string and its length would be returned instead of the value associated with the given key, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

DONE.
