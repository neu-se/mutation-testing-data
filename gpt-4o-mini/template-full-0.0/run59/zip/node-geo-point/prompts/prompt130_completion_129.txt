Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ longitude: this.longitude, latitude: this.latitude }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the input to the `GeoPoint.toTile` method from the current instance (`this`) to an object with properties, which may not be compatible with the expected input type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.latitude, this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new `GeoPoint` instance with the latitude and longitude swapped, which would lead to incorrect tile calculations based on the wrong coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the coordinate to the `GeoPoint.toTile` method would likely cause runtime errors or unexpected results, as the method expects a valid `LatLng` object.

DONE.
