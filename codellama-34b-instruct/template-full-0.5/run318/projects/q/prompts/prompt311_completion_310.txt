  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a resolved promise when all of the promises in an array are resolved, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` is a function that returns a resolved promise when any of the promises in an array are resolved, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
