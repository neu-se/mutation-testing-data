  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` should be `nodeback()` to invoke the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback(error, value)` would always call the `nodeback` function with error `error` and value `value` regardless of the actual error and value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log(error)` would log the error to the console, but it would not call the `nodeback` function.

DONE.
