  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function checks if the input is a glob pattern, and the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src) && src !== '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `src !== '*'` would prevent the code from executing if the input is a glob pattern that matches all files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src) || src === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `src === '*'` would allow the code to execute if the input is a glob pattern that matches all files.

DONE.
