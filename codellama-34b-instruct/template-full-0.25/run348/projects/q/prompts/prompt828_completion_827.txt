  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` property would be set to `null`, which would prevent any error handlers from being called when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` property would be set to a function that throws an error, which would cause any error handlers to be called with a different error object than the one that was originally passed to `Q.onerror`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { return; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` property would be set to a function that returns without doing anything, which would cause any error handlers to be called with the original error object, but without any of the original error handling logic being executed.
