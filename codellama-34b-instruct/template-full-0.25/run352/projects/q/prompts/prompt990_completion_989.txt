  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array of arguments, but the new code fragment would pass a single number (1) instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array of arguments, but the new code fragment would pass a null value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array of arguments, but the new code fragment would pass an undefined value instead.

DONE.
