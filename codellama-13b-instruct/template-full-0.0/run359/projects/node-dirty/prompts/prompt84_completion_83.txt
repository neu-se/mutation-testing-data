  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\n'

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was only a newline character, while the new code fragment is a newline character followed by another newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\n\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was only a newline character, while the new code fragment is a newline character followed by two more newline characters. This would cause the `split` method to split the input string into an array of strings, where each string is a line of the input, and each line is followed by an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
