 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would always return true, causing the function to return a constant value of 1 instead of using the Taylor series approximation for small x values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an exponential function, which is not present in the original code fragment. This change would lead to a different implementation of the `cosm1` function, affecting its accuracy and potentially causing issues with other parts of the code that rely on this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the conditional statement with the absolute value of x, which would always be non-negative. This change would lead to incorrect results for negative x values, as the original code fragment is designed to handle negative x values correctly.

DONE.
