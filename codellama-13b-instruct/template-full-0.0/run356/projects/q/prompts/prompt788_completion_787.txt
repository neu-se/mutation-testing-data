  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

DONE.
