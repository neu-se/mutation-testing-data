  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be inverted, meaning that it would be called instead of not being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called immediately instead of being passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with `abort` set to `true` instead of the original value.

DONE.
