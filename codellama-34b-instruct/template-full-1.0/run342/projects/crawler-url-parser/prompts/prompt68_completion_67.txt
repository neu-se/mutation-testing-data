  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called twice, and the second time it is called, it may return a different object, which could lead to different behavior in the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(embedBaseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedBaseUrlStr` is not necessarily equal to `baseUrlStr`, and it may not have the same properties or behavior as the object returned by `parse`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(data);
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is not necessarily a string, and the `parse` function may not be able to handle non-string input.

DONE.
