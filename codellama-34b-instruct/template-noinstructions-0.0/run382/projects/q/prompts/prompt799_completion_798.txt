  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid promise, while `null` is not a valid promise and would cause the promise chain to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid promise, while `undefined` is not a valid promise and would cause the promise chain to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid promise, while `Q.reject("error")` is a rejected promise with the reason "error".

DONE.
