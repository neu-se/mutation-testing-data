 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
href === null || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `===` operator instead of `==`, which checks for strict equality. This could cause issues if `href` is a non-empty string that is not equal to `undefined` but is still falsy, such as an empty string or a string containing only whitespace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof href === "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/i.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `/i` flag to make the regular expression case-insensitive. This could cause issues if the code relies on the case-sensitivity of the regular expression to correctly identify certain types of links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
