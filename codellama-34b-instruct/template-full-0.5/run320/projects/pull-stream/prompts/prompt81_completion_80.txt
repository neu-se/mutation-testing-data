  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `err` to `true`, regardless of its original value, which could cause the `abort` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `cb` to `null`, regardless of its original value, which could cause the `abort` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err = new Error('aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `err` to a new error object, regardless of its original value, which could cause the `abort` function to behave differently.

DONE.
