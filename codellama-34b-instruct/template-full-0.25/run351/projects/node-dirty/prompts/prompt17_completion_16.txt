  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being modified, which could cause the code to access different data in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo' + key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being concatenated with the string `'foo'`, which could cause the code to access a different key in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being converted to uppercase, which could cause the code to access a different key in the database.

DONE.
