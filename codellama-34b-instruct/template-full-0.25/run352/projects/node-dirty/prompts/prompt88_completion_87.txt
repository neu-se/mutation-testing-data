  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would remove the last element of the `arr` array, while the modified code fragment `arr.pop(arr.length - 1)` would remove the first element of the `arr` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would remove the last element of the `arr` array, while the modified code fragment `arr.pop(arr.length)` would remove the first element of the `arr` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length - 2);
```
