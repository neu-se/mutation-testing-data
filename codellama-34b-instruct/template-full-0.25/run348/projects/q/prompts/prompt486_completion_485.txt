  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the unhandled rejections array, which would cause any unhandled rejections to be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the length of the unhandled rejections array to 0, which would also cause any unhandled rejections to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the length of the unhandled reasons array to 0, which would cause any unhandled reasons to be ignored.

DONE.
