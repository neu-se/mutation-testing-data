  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "index" for the word "index", while the new code fragment would return "indices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "indices" for the word "index", while the new code fragment would return "indiceses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "indices" for the word "index", while the new code fragment would return "indices".

DONE.
