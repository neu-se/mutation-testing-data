  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid argument for the `Q.nextTick` function, which expects a function as its first argument. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `Q.nextTick` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a valid argument for the `Q.nextTick` function, which expects a function as its first argument. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `Q.nextTick` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"hello"` is not a function, and therefore cannot be passed as an argument to the `Q.nextTick` function. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `Q.nextTick` function is called.

DONE
