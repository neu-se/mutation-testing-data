This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would return a promise that is fulfilled when all the promises in the input array are fulfilled, rather than returning a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promise states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would return a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the input array are fulfilled, rather
