  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the value of `b` instead of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying `a` and `b` instead of using the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding `a` and `b` instead of using the value of `a`.

DONE.
