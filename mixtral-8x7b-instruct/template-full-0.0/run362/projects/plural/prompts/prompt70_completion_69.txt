 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the rule for 'cello' with the `addRule` function, while this change directly assigns the string 'cellos' to the `rules` array. This change would bypass the rule-adding function and directly add the string, possibly causing unexpected behavior in the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a
