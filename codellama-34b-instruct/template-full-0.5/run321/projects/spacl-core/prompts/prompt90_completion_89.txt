  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `const` keyword is used to declare a constant, which cannot be reassigned. In the original code, the `const policy` declaration is inside the loop, so it is redeclared on each iteration. By replacing `const` with `let`, the `policy` variable is no longer constant, and can be reassigned on each iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the loop. In the original code, the `const policy` declaration is inside the loop, so it is redeclared on each iteration. By replacing `const` with `let`, the `policy` variable is no longer block-scoped, and can be accessed outside the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
