  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a delta with a length of 0, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a delta with a length of -1, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a delta with a length of null, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
