  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Invalid key'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom error message, whereas the original code would emit an error event with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Key not found'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different error message than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Invalid key'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom error message, whereas the original code would emit an error event with a different error message.

DONE.
