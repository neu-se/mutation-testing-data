  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `attributes` object is not null and has at least one property. If the `attributes` object is null or has no properties, the `newOp.attributes` property will not be set, which may cause issues in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 0 && attributes.some(attr => attr.value !== null)
```
This code fragment checks if the `attributes` object is not null, has at least one property, and if any of the properties have a non-null value. If the `attributes` object is null or has no properties with non-null values, the `newOp.attributes` property will not be set, which may cause issues in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 0 && attributes.every(attr => attr.value !== null)
```
