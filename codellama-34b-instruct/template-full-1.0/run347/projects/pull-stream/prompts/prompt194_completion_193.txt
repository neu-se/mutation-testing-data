  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, but the new code fragment `null` evaluates to a null value, so the function call is not made.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, but the new code fragment `undefined` evaluates to an undefined value, so the function call is not made.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, but the new code fragment `{}` evaluates to an empty object, which is not a function and cannot be called.

DONE.
