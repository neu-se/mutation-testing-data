Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
function stringify (obj, { EOL = '\n', finalEOL = true, replacer = null, spaces } = {}) {
  const EOF = finalEOL ? EOL : ''
  const str = JSON.stringify(<PLACEHOLDER>, replacer, spaces)

  return str.replace(/\n/g, EOL) + EOF
}

function stripBom (content) {
  // we do this because JSON.parse would convert it to a utf8 string if encoding wasn't specified
  if (Buffer.isBuffer(content)) content = content.toString('utf8')
  return content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
}

module.exports = { stringify, stripBom }

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
obj
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
