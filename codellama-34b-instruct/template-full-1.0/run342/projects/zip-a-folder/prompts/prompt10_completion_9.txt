  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGlob(src)` would always evaluate to `false` in the original code, but by replacing it with `=== false`, it would only be false if the value of `isGlob(src)` is actually false, otherwise it would be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGlob(src)` would always evaluate to true in the original code, but by replacing it with `!== true`, it would only be true if the value of `isGlob(src)` is actually true, otherwise it would be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical negation operator in JavaScript, so `!isGlob(src)` would evaluate to true if `isGlob(
