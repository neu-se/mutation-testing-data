  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the `reviver` option is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'null'` is a string, and it would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the `reviver` option is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object, and it would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the `reviver` option is not provided.

DONE.
