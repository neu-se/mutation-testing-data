  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `index` variable, which was defined in the `eachLine` method, to determine the current line number. Replacing it with `0` would cause the code to always use the first line, regardless of the current line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `index` variable, which was defined in the `eachLine` method, to determine the current line number. Replacing it with `-1` would cause the code to always use the last line, regardless of the current line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `index` variable, which was defined in the `eachLine` method, to determine the current line number. Replacing it with `index + 1` would
