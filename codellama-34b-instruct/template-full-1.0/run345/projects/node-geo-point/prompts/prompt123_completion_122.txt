  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate2
```
This would result in different behavior because `coordinate2` is a different argument from `point`, which is the original argument that is being passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.x + point.y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the x and y coordinates of the point, which would result in a different result than simply passing the point itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the point by 2, which would result in a different result than simply passing the point itself.

DONE.
