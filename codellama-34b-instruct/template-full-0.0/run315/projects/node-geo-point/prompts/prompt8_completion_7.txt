  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has the `coordinates` property, while this code checks if the `coordinates` property is an own property of the `point` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has the `type` property, while this code checks if the `type` property is an own property of the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has the `latitude` property, while this code checks if the `latitude` property is an own property of the `point` object.

DONE.
