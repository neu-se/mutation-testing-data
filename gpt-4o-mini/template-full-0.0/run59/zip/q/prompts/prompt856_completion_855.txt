Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve to `undefined` instead of the original `value`, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent promise chains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a custom error instead of resolving with the original `value`, causing any subsequent `.then` handlers to be skipped and the error to be propagated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve to `value + 1`, which changes the resolved value and could lead to incorrect results if the subsequent logic expects the original `value`.

DONE.
