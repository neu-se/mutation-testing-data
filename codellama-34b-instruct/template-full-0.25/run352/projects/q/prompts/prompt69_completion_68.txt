  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because `port1` and `port2` are different ports, and `postMessage` is a method that sends a message to the port. Using `port1` instead of `port2` would cause the message to be sent to a different port, which could have unintended consequences.
