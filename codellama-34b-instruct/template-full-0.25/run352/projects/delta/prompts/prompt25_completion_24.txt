  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to the same type, while the new code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for both equality and type equality. This means that the new code fragment may produce different results when comparing values of different types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to the same type, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for both inequality and type inequality. This means that the new code fragment may produce different results when comparing values of different types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] > b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses
