```
policies.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of the `policies` array except the first one. This change will cause the `push` method to skip the first policy in the array, which may cause the test suite to miss testing that policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== 'admin')
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the policies in the `policies` array except the ones with the name 'admin'. This change will cause the `push` method to skip policies with the name 'admin', which may cause the test suite to miss testing those policies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This code fragment will return a new array containing the names of all the policies in the `policies` array. This change will cause the `push` method
