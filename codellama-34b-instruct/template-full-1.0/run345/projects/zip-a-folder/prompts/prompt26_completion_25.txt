  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `archiver()` would be an empty object instead of the actual `archiverOptions` object passed in, which would cause the `archiver()` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, archiverOptions || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `archiver()` would be `null` instead of the actual `format` string passed in, which would cause the `archiver()` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gzip', archiverOptions || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `archiver()` would be the string 'gzip' instead of the actual `format` string passed in, which would cause the `archiver()` function to behave differently.

DONE.
