  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push("\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer join the stacks with the separator, but instead push the separator onto the stacks array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of stacks instead of joining the elements with the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.splice(0, stacks.length, "\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire stacks array with the separator, effectively removing all the stack traces.

DONE.
