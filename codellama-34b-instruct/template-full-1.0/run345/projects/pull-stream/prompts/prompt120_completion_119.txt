  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null when "end" is null, rather than the original code which would return "end" when "end" is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end != true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null when "end" is not true, rather than the original code which would return "end" when "end" is not true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null when "end" is not strictly equal to true, rather than the original code which would return "end" when "end" is not strictly equal to true.

DONE.
