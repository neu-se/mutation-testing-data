  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, rather than fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending, rather than fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled, rather than rejected.

DONE.
