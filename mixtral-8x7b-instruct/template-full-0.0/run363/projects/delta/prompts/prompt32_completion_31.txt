 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare keys from `a` instead of `attr`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute comparisons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `attr` parameter and always return an empty object, even if there are attributes to invert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider keys from `b` for inversion, ignoring keys from `attr` that are not present in `b`.

DONE.
