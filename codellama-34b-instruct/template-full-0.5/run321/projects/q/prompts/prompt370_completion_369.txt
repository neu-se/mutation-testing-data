  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `_progressed` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is fulfilled, whereas `_progressed` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `_progressed` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress.

DONE.
