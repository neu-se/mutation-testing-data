  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, so the function would return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (data) { return test(data) || test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return `true` if `test(data)` is true, or if it is called again with the same argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (data) { return !test(data) ? false : test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return `false` if `test(data)` is false, and `test(data)` otherwise, effectively making the function always return `true`.

DONE.
