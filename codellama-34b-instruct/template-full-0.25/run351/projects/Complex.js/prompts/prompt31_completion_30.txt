  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_b` is a different variable than `b`, and may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is a different expression than `b`, and may evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(b)` is a different expression than `b`, and may evaluate to a different value.

DONE.
