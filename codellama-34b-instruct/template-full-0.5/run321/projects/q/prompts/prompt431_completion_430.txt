  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.call(this)` would call the function with `this` as the `this` value, which would result in a different object being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.bind(this)` would create a new function that, when called, would call `this.inspect` with `this` as the `this` value, which would result in a different object being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.apply(this)` would call `this.inspect` with `this` as the `this` value, which would result in a different object being returned.
