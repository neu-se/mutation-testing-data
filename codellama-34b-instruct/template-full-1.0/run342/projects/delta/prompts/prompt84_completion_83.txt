  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the comparison, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the comparison is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = (new Function("return " + <PLACEHOLDER>))();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Function` constructor creates a new function with the provided source code and executes it immediately. This would cause the `<PLACEHOLDER>` value to be evaluated and assigned to the `PLACEHOLDER` variable, potentially changing the behavior of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = <PLACEHOLDER> + Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is a non-integer value, adding it to `<PL
