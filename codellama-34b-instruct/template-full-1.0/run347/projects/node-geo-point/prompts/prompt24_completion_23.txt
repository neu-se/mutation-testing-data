  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the 'longitude' property is in the object, rather than the 'hasOwnProperty' method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.propertyIsEnumerable('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the 'latitude' property is enumerable, rather than checking if the object has a 'latitude' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keyIsOwn('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object contains a key called 'longitude', rather than checking if the 'hasOwnProperty' method returns true for the 'longitude' property.

DONE.
