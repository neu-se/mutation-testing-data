  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the length of the operation by 1, while this modified code fragment increments the length by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the length of the operation by 1, while this modified code fragment decrements the length by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the length of the operation by 1, while this modified code fragment increments the length by 2.

DONE.
