  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [val, key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the key and value in the map, potentially causing the `get` method to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key + 1, val];
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the key by 1, potentially causing the `get` method to return incorrect values or fail to find existing keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, val + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the value by 1, potentially causing the `get` method to return incorrect values or fail to find existing keys.

DONE.
