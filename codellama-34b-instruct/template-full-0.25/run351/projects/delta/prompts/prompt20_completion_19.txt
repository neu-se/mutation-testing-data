  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects being compared, which could lead to different results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return `null` instead of an object, which could cause errors in the code that uses the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return `undefined` instead of an object, which could cause errors in the code that uses the function.

DONE.
