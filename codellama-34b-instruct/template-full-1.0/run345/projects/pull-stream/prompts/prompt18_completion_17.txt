  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s
```
This would result in different behavior because `s` is a different variable than `read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[i]` is a different value than `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a different value than `read + 1`.

DONE.
