  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` variable would be initialized with a resolved promise, which would cause the `get` method to return a resolved promise instead of a rejected one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` variable would be initialized with a rejected promise, which would cause the `get` method to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` variable would be initialized with a null value, which would cause the `get` method to return a null value instead of a promise.

DONE.
