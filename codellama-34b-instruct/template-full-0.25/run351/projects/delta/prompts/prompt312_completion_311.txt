  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line in the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the lines in the document in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over every other line in the document twice.

DONE.
