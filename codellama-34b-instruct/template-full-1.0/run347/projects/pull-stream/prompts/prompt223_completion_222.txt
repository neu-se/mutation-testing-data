  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var test;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `tester` is a function call that returns a function, while `var test;` is a variable declaration that does not have any effect on the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (test) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `tester` is a function call that returns a function, while `if (test) {}` is a control flow statement that does not have any effect on the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `tester` is a function call that returns a function, while `data` is a parameter name that does not have any effect on the function's behavior.

DONE.
