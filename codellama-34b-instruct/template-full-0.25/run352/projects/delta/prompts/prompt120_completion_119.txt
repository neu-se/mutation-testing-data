  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `delete` property to be incremented by 1, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `delete` property to be decremented by 1, which would also change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `delete` property to be multiplied by 2, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
