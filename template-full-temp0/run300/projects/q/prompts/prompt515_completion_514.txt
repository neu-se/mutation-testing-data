  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject` to reject the promise, while this option uses `return deferred.reject` to return the rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject` to reject the promise, while this option uses `deferred.resolve` to resolve the promise with the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject` to reject the promise, while this option uses `deferred.notify` to notify the promise with the exception.

DONE.
