Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current operation and start from the next one, potentially omitting an operation that should be included in the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to slice the operations starting from the previous index, which could lead to accessing an invalid operation or returning unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the slice starting point by adding the offset to the index, which could lead to returning operations that are not intended to be part of the result.

DONE.
