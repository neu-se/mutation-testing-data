  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object, but `null` is not an error object and would not cause the stream to error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object, but `undefined` is not an error object and would not cause the stream to error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('some error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object, but `new Error('some error message')` is a different error object with a different message and would cause the stream to error.

DONE.
