  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call(domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with the `domain` object as its `this` binding, which may change its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.apply(domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with the `domain` object as its `this` binding, and any arguments passed to the `task` function would be passed as an array to the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.bind(domain)();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be bound to the `domain` object as its `this` binding, and then immediately invoked with no arguments.

DONE.
