  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now checking the `currentUrlStr` instead of the `baseUrlStr`, which could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!baseUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now checking the negation of the `baseUrlStr` instead of the `currentUrlStr`, which could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now checking both the `baseUrlStr` and the `currentUrlStr` for illegal
