  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `readFile` method directly on the `fs` object, rather than using the `universalify.fromCallback` method to wrap it in a promise. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `fs` object is not a promise-based API.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `readFileSync` method directly on the `fs` object, rather than using the `universalify.fromCallback` method to wrap it in a promise. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `fs` object is not a promise-based API.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
