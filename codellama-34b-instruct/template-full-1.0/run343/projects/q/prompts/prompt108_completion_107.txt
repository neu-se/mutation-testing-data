  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never end if the condition is not met, as the loop counter would be decremented instead of incremented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i+2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, as the loop counter would be incremented by 2 instead of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the array twice as fast, as the loop counter would be incremented by 2 instead of 1.

DONE.
