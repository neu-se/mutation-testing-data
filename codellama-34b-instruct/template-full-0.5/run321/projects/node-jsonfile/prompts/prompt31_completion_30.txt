  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `stringify`, rather than the `options` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `reviver` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `stringify`, rather than the `options` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `throws` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `stringify`, rather than the `options` object itself.

DONE.
