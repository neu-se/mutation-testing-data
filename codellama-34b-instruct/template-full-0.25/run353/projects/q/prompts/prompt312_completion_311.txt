  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the index of the current element in the loop to `Q()`, rather than the element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the next element in the loop to `Q()`, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the previous element in the loop to `Q()`, rather than the current element.

DONE.
