  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function is called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to `setTimeout`. This would cause the task to be executed immediately, rather than being queued for later execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestTick, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function is passed as a callback to `setTimeout`, rather than being called immediately. This would cause the task to be queued for later execution, rather than being executed immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(requestTick)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function is passed as a callback to `setImmediate`, rather than being called immediately. This would cause the task to be queued for later execution, rather than being executed immediately.

DONE.
