  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment would not match the regular expression /^(?:wo)?man$/i and would not trigger the function that returns w.replace(regex, 'ves').

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bison'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment would not match the regular expression /\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i and would not trigger the function that returns w.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'pliers'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment would not match the regular expression RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i') and would not trigger the function that returns w.

DONE.
