  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + 'foo'
```
This code fragment will cause the `access` method to check for read and write permissions on the concatenated path, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.substring(1)
```
This code fragment will cause the `access` method to check for read and write permissions on the substring of the target base path, which may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This code fragment will cause the `access` method to check for read and write permissions on the uppercase version of the target base path, which may not exist.

DONE.
