  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two elements of the `other.ops` array, rather than just the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate the first element of the `other.ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate the second element of the `other.ops` array, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
