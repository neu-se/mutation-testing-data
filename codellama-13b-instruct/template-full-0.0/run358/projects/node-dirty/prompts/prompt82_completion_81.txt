  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified character in the string, and the `!==` operator checks for inequality. In the original code, the `lastIndexOf` method returns `-1` if the character is not found, and the `===` operator checks for equality. By changing the operator to `!==`, the code will now check for inequality, and the `if` statement will be executed if the character is found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string, and the `!==` operator checks for inequality. In the original code, the `indexOf` method returns `-1` if the character is not found, and the `===` operator checks for equality. By changing the operator to `!==`, the code
