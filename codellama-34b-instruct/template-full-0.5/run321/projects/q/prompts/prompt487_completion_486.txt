  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two elements from the `unhandledRejections` array instead of one, potentially causing the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag to be set to `false` when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two elements from the `unhandledReasons` array instead of one, potentially causing the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag to be set to `false` when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(at, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of one, potentially causing the `trackUnhandledRejections
