  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name
```
This change will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to always return `true`, even if the `timezone` object is empty or has no `name` property. This will result in the `timezones` object being updated with an empty object, which may cause issues when trying to access the `timezones` object later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name === 'UTC'
```
This change will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to only return `true` if the `timezone` object has a `name` property that is equal to `'UTC'`. This will result in the `timezones` object being updated with an object that has a `name` property equal to `'UTC'`, which may cause issues when trying to access the `timezones` object later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name.length > 0
