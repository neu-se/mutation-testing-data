 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `fulfill` is a reference to a function that resolves the promise, while `Promise.resolve()` immediately creates a resolved promise. This change would cause the function to return a promise that is already resolved, instead of resolving it in the future.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `fulfill` is a reference to a function that resolves the promise, while `value` is the input argument that is passed to the constructor. This change would cause the function to return the input argument directly, instead of resolving the promise with the input argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(function() { fulfill }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `fulfill` is a reference to a function that resolves the promise, while
