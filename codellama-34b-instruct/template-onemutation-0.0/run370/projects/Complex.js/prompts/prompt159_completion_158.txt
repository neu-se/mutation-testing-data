  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` and `z` are both zero, while the new code fragment only checks if `this` is zero. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` when `z` is zero, even if `this` is not zero.
