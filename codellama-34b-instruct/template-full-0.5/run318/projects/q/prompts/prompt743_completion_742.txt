  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved twice, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved twice, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).then(onRejected, onFulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved twice, with the order of the callbacks being reversed, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
