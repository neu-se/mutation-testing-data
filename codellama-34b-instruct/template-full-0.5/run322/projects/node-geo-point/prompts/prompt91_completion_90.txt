  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing in the range of -180 to 180 degrees, while the modified code would calculate the bearing in the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing in the range of -180 to 180 degrees, while the modified code would calculate the bearing in the range of -360 to 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing in the range of -180 to 180 degrees, while the modified code would calculate the bearing in the range of -270 to 90 degrees.

DONE.
