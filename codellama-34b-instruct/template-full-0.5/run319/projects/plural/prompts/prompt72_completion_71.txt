  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the singular form of the word "cello" instead of the plural form "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the concatenation of the singular form of the word "cello" with the string "s", resulting in "cellos" instead of the expected "cello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the concatenation of the singular form of the word "cello" with the string "es", resulting in "celloes" instead of the expected "cellos".

DONE.
