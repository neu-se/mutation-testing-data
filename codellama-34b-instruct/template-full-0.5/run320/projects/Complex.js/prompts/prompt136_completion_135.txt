  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `isInfinite()`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isInfinite()` checks if a value is infinite. If the value is finite, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), whereas `isInfinite()` checks if a value is infinite. If the value is NaN, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

DONE.
