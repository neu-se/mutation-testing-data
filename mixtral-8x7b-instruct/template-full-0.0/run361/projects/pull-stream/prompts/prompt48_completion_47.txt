 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other argument after the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the addition assignment operator instead of the pre-increment operator, which may lead to different behavior when `i` is a property of an object or a function call with side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `length` instead of `i`, causing the loop to iterate one more time than intended and potentially accessing an undefined or unintended argument.

DONE.
