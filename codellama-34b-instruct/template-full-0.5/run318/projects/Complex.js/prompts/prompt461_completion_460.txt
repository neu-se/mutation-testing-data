  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `-Math.abs` would return the negative of the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(Math.abs(a) - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(Math.abs(a) - b)` would return the absolute value of the difference between the absolute value of `a` and `b`, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
