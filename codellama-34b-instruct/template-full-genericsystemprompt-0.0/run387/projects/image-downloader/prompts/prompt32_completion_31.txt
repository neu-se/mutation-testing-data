  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 300 is a valid status code for a successful response, but it is not the same as the original status code 200.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 400
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 400 is a valid status code for a client error, but it is not the same as the original status code 200.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 500
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 500 is a valid status code for a server error, but it is not the same as the original status code 200.

DONE.
