  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push();
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon (`;`) at the end of the line indicates to the interpreter that the statement is complete, so the `if` statement would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.length` is a number, not a function, so it could not be invoked with `()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.shift()` would remove the first element from the `laterQueue` array, whereas `laterQueue.push()` would add a new element to the end of the array.

DONE.
