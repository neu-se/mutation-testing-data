  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not used in the original code, so the `a` variable would not be affected by the change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression would be evaluated before being passed to the `Math.abs()` function, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - b` expression would be evaluated before being passed to the `Math.abs()` function, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
