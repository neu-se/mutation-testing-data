  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\r\n' is a Windows-style line ending, whereas '\n' is a Unix-style line ending. If the code is run on a Windows system, the '\r\n' line ending would cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\r' is a carriage return character, whereas '\n' is a line feed character. If the code is run on a system that uses carriage returns for line endings, the '\r' character would cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\0'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\0' is the null character, whereas '\n' is a line feed character. If the code is run on a system that uses null characters for line endings, the '\0' character would cause the code to behave
