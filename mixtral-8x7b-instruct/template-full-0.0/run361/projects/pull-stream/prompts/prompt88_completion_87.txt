 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return true, causing it to find a match in every iteration and not waiting for the actual condition to be met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => data.length > 0
