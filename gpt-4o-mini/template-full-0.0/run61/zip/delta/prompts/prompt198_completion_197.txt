Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp, delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the operands being concatenated, which could lead to a different resulting Delta object than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the second-to-last operation in the `delta.ops` array instead of the last one, potentially omitting the most recent operation from the composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a `null` value into the concatenation, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when processing the Delta object, as it would not be a valid operation.

DONE.
