  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be set to the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause the request to be sent over an unencrypted connection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be set to the `ftp` module, which is not a valid module for making HTTP requests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be set to the `https` module, but the URL would be prefixed with `https://`, which could cause the request to be sent to a different server.

DONE.
