  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being compared to `true` instead of being used as a boolean value. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is being used to negate the `end` variable. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being compared to `null` instead of being used as a boolean value. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
