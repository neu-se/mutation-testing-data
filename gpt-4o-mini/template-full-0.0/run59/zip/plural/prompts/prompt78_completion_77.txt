Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/goose$/, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "goose" to "gooses" instead of the correct "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'gooses')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the plural of "goose" to "gooses" instead of the correct "geese", which is not a proper pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/goose$/, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize "goose" to "goosies" instead of the correct "geese".

DONE.
