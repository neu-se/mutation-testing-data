  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id
```
This would result in different behavior because `id` is a function that returns its argument unchanged, while `prop` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a number, while `prop` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return "Hello, world!"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because this code returns a different value than `prop` would return.

DONE.
