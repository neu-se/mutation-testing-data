  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(() => 0).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function passed to `trimLeft` would always return 0, causing the conditional to always be false, even if the URL starts with "https".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.startsWith('https') && !url.trimLeft().startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the second condition would always be false, causing the conditional to always be true, even if the URL does not start with "https".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(() => 1).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function passed to `trimLeft` would always return 1, causing the conditional to always be true, even if the URL does not start with "https".

DONE.
