  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `fail` method of the promise and result in a rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the function to return a promise that is already resolved, which would result in the `then` method being called immediately with the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(error) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but a function that takes an `
