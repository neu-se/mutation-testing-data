  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `ops` property of the `nextOp` object, which is not the same as the `nextOp` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `ops` array, which is not the same as the `nextOp` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the `ops` array except for the first element, which is not the same as the `nextOp` object itself.

DONE.
