  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will remove the first element of the `args` array, which is the `op` argument, and return the remaining elements as a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat(args.shift())
```
This code fragment will concatenate the `args` array with the first element of the `args` array, which is the `op` argument, and return the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== op; })
```
This code fragment will filter the `args` array to remove any elements that are equal to the `op` argument, and return the resulting array.

DONE.
