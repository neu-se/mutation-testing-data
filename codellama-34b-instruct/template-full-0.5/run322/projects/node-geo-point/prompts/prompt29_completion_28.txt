  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is being used instead of the `longitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinates` property is being used instead of the `latitude` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinates` property is being used instead of the `latitude` property, and the first element of the `coordinates` array is being used instead of the second element.

DONE.
