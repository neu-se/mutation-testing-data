  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = flush;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event would be assigned to the `flush` function directly, rather than being wrapped in a closure that also calls `requestPortTick`. This could cause the `flush` function to be called too frequently, leading to performance issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function () {
  requestPortTick();
  flush();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event would be assigned to a function that calls both `requestPortTick` and `flush`, rather than just `flush` as in the original code. This could cause the `requestPortTick` function to be called more frequently than necessary, leading to performance issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function () {
  setTimeout(flush, 0);
};
```
