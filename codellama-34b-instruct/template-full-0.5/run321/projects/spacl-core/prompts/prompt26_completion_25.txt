  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the minimum number of matches is greater than zero, which is a necessary condition for the code to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the maximum number of matches is greater than zero, which is a necessary condition for the code to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max < min
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the maximum number of matches is greater than the minimum number of matches, which is a necessary condition for the code to work correctly.

DONE.
