  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the value associated with the key instead of returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set a new value for the key instead of returning the existing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of key-value pairs in the map instead of the value associated with the key.

DONE.
