  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.foo` is not a promise, so the `when` function would not wait for it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.bar` is not a function, so the `dispatch` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.baz` is not a property of `object`, so the `dispatch` method would not be called.

DONE.
