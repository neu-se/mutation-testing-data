  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"].then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not a property of the `finally` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"]().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not a function, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not a property of the `Q` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
