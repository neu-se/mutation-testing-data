Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially allowing files to be opened with flags that are not intended for files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isSymbolicLink()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a symbolic link instead of a directory, which could lead to incorrect error handling for symbolic links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always throws an error when the flags are not read-only, regardless of the node type, which could lead to incorrect error handling for directories and files.

DONE.
