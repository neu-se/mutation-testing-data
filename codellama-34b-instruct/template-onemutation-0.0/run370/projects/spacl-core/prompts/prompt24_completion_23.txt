  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `any` variable would be evaluated first, and the `max > 0` condition would only be evaluated if `any` is truthy. In the original code, the `max > 0` condition would be evaluated first, and the `any` variable would only be evaluated if `max > 0` is truthy.

DONE.
