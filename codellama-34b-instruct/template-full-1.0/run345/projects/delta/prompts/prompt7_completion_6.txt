  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes[key]` is not the same as `attributes`. The former is a property access, while the latter is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` is not the same as `attributes`. The former is a property access, while the latter is a variable reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(b)` returns an array of keys from the `b` object, whereas `attributes` is a variable reference.

DONE.
