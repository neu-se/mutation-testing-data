  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches the pattern `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. The modified code fragment checks if the part does not match the pattern `:.+`, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.

DONE.
