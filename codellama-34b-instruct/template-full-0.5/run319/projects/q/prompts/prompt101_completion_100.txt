  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is being called with three arguments, whereas the original code only passes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(this[index], basis)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to `callback` is reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `callback` is an index rather than the value at that index in the array.

DONE.
