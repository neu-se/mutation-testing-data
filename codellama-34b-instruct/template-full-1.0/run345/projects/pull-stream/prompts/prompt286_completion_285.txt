  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` is always truthy, whereas `end` is either true or false depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end + true` is always a truthy value, whereas `end` is either true or false depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? data : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `? :` is only evaluated if `end` is truthy, whereas `end + true` is always evaluated.

DONE.
