  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a function and the updated code would call that function, whereas the original code would simply pass the `aborted` parameter to the next callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"aborted"
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated code would pass the string "aborted" to the next callback, whereas the original code would pass the `aborted` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated code would pass the `null` value to the next callback, whereas the original code would pass the `aborted` parameter.

DONE.
