  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method than `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for an array of promises that are settled, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises that are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for the first resolved promise of an array, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for all resolved promises of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for all resolved promises of an array, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for all resolved and rejected promises of an array.

DONE.
