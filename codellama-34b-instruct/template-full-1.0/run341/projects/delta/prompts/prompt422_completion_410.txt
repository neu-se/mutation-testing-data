  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simplified the expression `index - offset` to `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simplified the expression `index - offset` to `index`, whereas the replaced code fragment would produce a different result due to the multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simplified the expression `index - offset` to `index`, whereas the replaced code fragment would produce a different result due to the subtraction.

DONE.
