  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
‘author’
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string that needs to be returned whereas the new fragment is a variable that needs to be accessed through the object’s properties. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.memos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string that needs to be returned whereas the new fragment is a property of the object that needs to be accessed. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.memos[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string that needs to be returned whereas the new fragment accesses the first element of an array that is stored as the object’s property.

DONE.
