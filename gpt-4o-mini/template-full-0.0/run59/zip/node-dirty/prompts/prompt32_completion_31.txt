Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrongKey'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the value associated with the string 'wrongKey' instead of the intended key, potentially leaving the actual key-value pair intact.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would not trigger the deletion of the key from `_data`, as `null` is not treated as `undefined`, thus leaving the key-value pair unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete a key that is a concatenation of the original key with '1', which likely does not exist in `_data`, leading to no deletion of the intended key-value pair.

DONE.
