  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `nbind` function to bind the arguments in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of elements in the array, which would cause the `nbind` function to bind the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the array, which would cause the `nbind` function to bind the wrong arguments.

DONE.
