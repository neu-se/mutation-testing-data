  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the exponent would be different, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the exponent would be different, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the exponent would be different, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
