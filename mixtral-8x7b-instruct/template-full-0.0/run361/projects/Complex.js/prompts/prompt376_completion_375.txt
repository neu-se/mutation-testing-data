 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(a * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of `a * a` instead of simply using `2 * a`. This change may cause issues when the input `a` is negative, as the square root of a negative number will result in a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `this['re']` property instead of the local variable `a`. This change may cause issues if the `this['re']` property is not properly initialized or if it is changed elsewhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(a) * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `2 * a` using the exponential and logarithmic functions instead of simply multiplying `a` by 2
