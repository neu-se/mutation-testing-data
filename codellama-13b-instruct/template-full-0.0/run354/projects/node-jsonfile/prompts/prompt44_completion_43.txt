  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

options.encoding

This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is now being accessed directly instead of being passed as an argument to the `stringify` function. This could potentially cause issues if the `options` object is not defined or if it does not have an `encoding` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is now being accessed with a different property name (`foo`) instead of the original `encoding` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is now being accessed with a different property name (`bar`) instead of the original `encoding` property. This could potentially cause issues if the `options` object does not have a
