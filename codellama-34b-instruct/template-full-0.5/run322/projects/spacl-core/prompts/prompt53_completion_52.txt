  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, but the new code fragment captures the last group of non-slash characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+?)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, but the new code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, but allows for zero or more characters to be matched.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, but the new code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, but allows for zero or one character to be matched.

DONE.
