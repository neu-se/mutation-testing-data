  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` would consume the response data, freeing up memory, whereas the original code fragment `res.resume` would not consume the response data, potentially leading to memory leaks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy()` would destroy the response stream, preventing any further data from being read, whereas the original code fragment `res.resume` would allow data to continue being read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pause()` would pause the response stream, potentially leading to a timeout error if the response is not resumed, whereas the original code fragment `res.resume` would allow data to continue being read.

DONE.
