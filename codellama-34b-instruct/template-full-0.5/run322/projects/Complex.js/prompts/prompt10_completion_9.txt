  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be computing the hyperbolic cosine of a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be computing the hyperbolic sine of a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function would be computing the cosine of a different value.

DONE.
