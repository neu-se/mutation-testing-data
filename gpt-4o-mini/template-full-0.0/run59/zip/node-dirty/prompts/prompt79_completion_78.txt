Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of emitting an 'error' event when an error occurs, it would emit a 'warning' event, which may not be handled by the same listeners, potentially leading to unhandled errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event instead of an 'error' event when an error occurs, which could mislead the application into thinking that the loading process was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an 'info' event instead of an 'error' event, which could cause the application to ignore critical error handling logic that is specifically designed for 'error' events.

DONE.
