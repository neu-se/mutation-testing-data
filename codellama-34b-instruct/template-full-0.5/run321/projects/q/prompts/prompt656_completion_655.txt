  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an empty array, which would not allow the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an array that only contains the first argument, which would not allow the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an array that contains all of the arguments, which would allow the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
