  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands in the `atan2` function is reversed, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
