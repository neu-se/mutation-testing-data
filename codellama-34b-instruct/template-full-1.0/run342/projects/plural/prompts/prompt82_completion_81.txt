  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (word, regex) { return word; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would return "mice" for the input "mouse", whereas this modified function would return "mouse" for the same input, resulting in a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (word, regex) { return word + "ice"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would return "mice" for the input "mouse", whereas this modified function would return "mouseice" for the same input, resulting in a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (word, regex) { return word.replace("mouse", "mice"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would return "mice" for the input "mouse", whereas this modified function would return "mice" for the input "mouse", resulting in a bug.

DONE.
