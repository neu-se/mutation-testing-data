  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of strings, whereas the original code fragment returns a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '**')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method replaces all occurrences of the first argument with the second argument, whereas the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string with the first character removed, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
