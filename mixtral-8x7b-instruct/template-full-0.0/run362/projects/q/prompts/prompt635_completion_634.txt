 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method checks if the `object` is an instance of `Promise` and throws an error if it is not. Replacing it with `null` would bypass this check and result in a `TypeError` being thrown in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects the `object` to have a `promiseDispatch` method, which is not present in an array. This would result in a `TypeError` being thrown in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects the `object` to have a `promiseDispatch` method, which is not present in a function. This would result in a `TypeError` being thrown in the `dispatch` method
