  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL to "https" instead of "http".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL to "ftp" instead of "http".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "www." subdomain to the URL instead of the protocol.

DONE.
