  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which negates the truthiness of the operand. In this case, it would negate the truthiness of the `data` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `data` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `data` object by 2, which could potentially change the behavior of the `test` function.

DONE.
