  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return one fewer element than it should, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return one more element than it should, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length * 2
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return twice as many elements as it should, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
