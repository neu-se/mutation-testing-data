  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array with the specified elements, while `splice` returns the elements that were removed from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Rejection(at, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Rejection` is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[at].splice(0,1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the array at the specified index, while the original code splices out the element at the specified index.

DONE.
