  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejects
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected regardless of the promise's fulfillment, which would change the behavior of the `fail` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` regardless of the promise's rejection, which would change the behavior of the `catch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
returns
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the return value of the `rejected` callback, which could change the behavior of the `catch` method.

DONE.
