Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `handler` is strictly `undefined`, which would not catch cases where `handler` is `null` or any other falsy value, potentially leading to a situation where a valid handler is incorrectly assumed to be absent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `handler` is not `null` or `undefined`, which would allow for a scenario where a falsy value (like `false` or `0`) could be treated as a valid handler, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.handlers[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the handler for the specific `embedType` is falsy, which could lead to a situation where a valid handler is present but not correctly referenced, causing the error to be thrown incorrectly.

DONE.
