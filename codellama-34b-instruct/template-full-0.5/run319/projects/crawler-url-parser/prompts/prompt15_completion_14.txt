```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the dollar sign at the end to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the caret at the beginning to match the start of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the dollar sign at the end to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the caret at the beginning to match the start of the string, and the "g" flag at the end to match all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the dollar sign at the end to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the caret at the beginning to match the start of the string, and the "i" flag at the end to
