 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the `options.dest` path relative to the current working directory instead of the module's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname + '/' + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the module's directory and `options.dest` with a string concatenation operator instead of using `path.join` or `path.resolve`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts `options.dest` to a string, which may not be the desired behavior if `options.dest` is a non-string value.

DONE.
