  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` even if there are still operations left in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property is an array of operations, and its length is not necessarily the same as the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property is the index of the current operation in the `ops` array, and adding 1 to it would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` even if there are still operations left in the iterator.

DONE.
