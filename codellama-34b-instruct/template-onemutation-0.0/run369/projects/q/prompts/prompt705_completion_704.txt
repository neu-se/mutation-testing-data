  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a local variable in the `fbind` function, while `arguments` is a built-in object that contains the arguments passed to the function. Using `args` instead of `arguments` would cause the function to bind the wrong arguments to the function.

DONE.
