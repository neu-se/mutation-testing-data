  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws a `PLACEHOLDER` error, while this code throws a more specific `Error` object with the message "Invalid Param".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 'Invalid Param';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws a `PLACEHOLDER` error, while this code throws a string with the message "Invalid Param".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws a `PLACEHOLDER` error, while this code throws a `TypeError` object with the message "Invalid Param".

DONE.
