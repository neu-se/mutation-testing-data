 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/[^/][:]|:\/|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a character other than '/' followed by a colon (`[^/]:`), instead of just a colon (`:`) after a slash (`/`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/[^/]:|:[/]|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a colon (`:`) followed by a slash (`/`) or end-of-string (`$`), instead of just a colon (`:`) after a slash (`/`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/[^/]:|:\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the global flag (`g`), which would change the behavior of the regular expression to find all occurrences instead of
