  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a function that returns the angle of the point (y, x) in the plane (which is the opposite of the angle of the point (x, y) in the plane), whereas `atan2` is a function that returns the angle of the point (x, y) in the plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that returns the angle of the point (y, x) in the plane, whereas `atan2` is a function that returns the angle of the point (x, y) in the plane.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(y, x)` is a function that returns the angle of the point (y, x) in the plane,
