  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to run fewer times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `i` variable by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the loop to run twice as many times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `i` variable by 2 instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to run twice as many times.

DONE.
