  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter would be incremented by 1, causing the plural form of the word to be returned even if the original word was already plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter would be decremented by 1, causing the singular form of the word to be returned even if the original word was already singular.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter would be multiplied by 2, causing the plural form of the word to be returned even if the original word was already singular, and causing the singular form of the word to be returned even if the original word was already plural.

DONE.
