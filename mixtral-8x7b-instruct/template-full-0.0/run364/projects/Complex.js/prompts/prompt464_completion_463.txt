 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1 *
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the imaginary part, which should be positive if it's less than the epsilon value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 *
```
This would result in different behavior because it always makes the imaginary part positive, even if it's originally negative. This could lead to incorrect string representations of complex numbers with negative imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b - Complex['EPSILON'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the absolute difference between the imaginary part and the epsilon value, instead of checking if the imaginary part is less than the epsilon value. This could lead to incorrect string representations of complex numbers with small imaginary parts.

DONE.
