  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "."
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the last directory in the URL path, while the replacement code fragment matches the last directory or file in the URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, ".."
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the last directory in the URL path, while the replacement code fragment matches the last directory or the directory above it in the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "../"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the last directory in the URL path, while the replacement code fragment matches the directory above the last directory in the URL path.

DONE.
