  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream || 'object' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the stream is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && stream.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the stream is an object and has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && stream.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the stream is an object and has a length of 0.

DONE.
