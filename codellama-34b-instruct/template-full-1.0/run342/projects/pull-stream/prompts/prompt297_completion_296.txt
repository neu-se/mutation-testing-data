  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with `null` as the error argument, even if an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the `ended` variable as the error argument, even if an error does not occur.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with `null` as both the error and data arguments, even if an error does not occur.

DONE.
