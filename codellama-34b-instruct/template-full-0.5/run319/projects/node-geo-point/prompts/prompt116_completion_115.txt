  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the current point and the destination point, rather than the destination point itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the current point and the destination point, rather than the destination point itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point based on the current point, distance, and bearing, rather than just returning the destination point.

DONE.
