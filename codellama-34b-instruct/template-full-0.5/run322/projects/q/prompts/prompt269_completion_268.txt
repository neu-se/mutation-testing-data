  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are different functions with different meanings in the context of promises. `resolve` is used to resolve a promise with a value, while `reject` is used to reject a promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a method that is not defined in the `Promise` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that is not defined in the `Promise` class.

DONE.
