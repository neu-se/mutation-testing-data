  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op instead of the base op, which could cause the transformation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use null as the attributes of the base op, which could cause the transformation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op as the attributes of the base op, which could cause the transformation to produce a different result.

DONE.
