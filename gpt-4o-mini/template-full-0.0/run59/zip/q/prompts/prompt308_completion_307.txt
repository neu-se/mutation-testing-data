Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Promise rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the value of the first settled promise, it would immediately reject the promise with a new error, causing any subsequent `.then()` calls to handle a rejection instead of a fulfillment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` regardless of the actual value of the first settled promise, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the resolved value in subsequent promise chains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(arguments[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the first argument passed to the callback instead of the value of the first settled promise, which could lead to unexpected results if the first argument is not the intended value.

DONE.
