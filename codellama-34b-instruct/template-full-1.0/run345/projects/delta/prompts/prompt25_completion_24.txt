  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] || b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce short-circuiting behavior, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] && a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce short-circuiting behavior in the opposite direction, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a string value that is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
