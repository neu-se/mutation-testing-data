  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method would return a different value, which could affect the calculation of the complex number's sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method would return a different value, which could affect the calculation of the complex number's sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method would return a different value, which could affect the calculation of the complex number's sign.

DONE.
