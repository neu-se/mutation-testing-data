  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.push({})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method adds a new element to the end of the array, whereas the original code fragment was calling the `flush` method to write the data to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment was calling the `flush` method to write the data to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element from the array, whereas the original code fragment was calling the `flush` method to write the data to the stream.

DONE.
