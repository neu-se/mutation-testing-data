 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `ref` array is accessed instead of the second one, potentially affecting the order of processing the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument of the `ref` array is accessed, which might not be the intended argument for the `pull` function, especially when there are more than 3 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the `ref` array is removed and returned, changing the order of arguments and potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `pull` function.

DONE.
