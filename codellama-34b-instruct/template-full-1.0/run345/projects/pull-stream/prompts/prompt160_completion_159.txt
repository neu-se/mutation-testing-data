  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and would cause the callback to be invoked with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and would cause the callback to be invoked with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function() {}` is not the same as `null`, and would cause the callback to be invoked with a different argument.

DONE.
