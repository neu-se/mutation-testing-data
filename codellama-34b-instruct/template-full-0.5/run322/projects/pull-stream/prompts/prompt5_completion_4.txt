  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the order of the elements in the `throughs` array to be reversed, which could potentially affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a shallow copy of the `throughs` array, which could potentially affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would combine the `throughs` array with another array, which could potentially affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
