  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to create a slice of the `arguments` array starting from index 0, but this replacement code fragment starts from index 1. This would cause the first argument to be excluded from the slice, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to create a slice of the `arguments` array starting from index 0, but this replacement code fragment starts from the last index. This would cause the last argument to be excluded from the slice, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses
