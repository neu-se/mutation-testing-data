  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').html()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the HTML content of the first anchor element, whereas the original code returns the href attribute of the first anchor element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').eq(1).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the href attribute of the second anchor element, whereas the original code returns the href attribute of the first anchor element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a:not(".external")').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the href attribute of the first anchor element that does not have a class of "external", whereas the original code returns the href attribute of the first anchor element regardless of its class.

DONE.
