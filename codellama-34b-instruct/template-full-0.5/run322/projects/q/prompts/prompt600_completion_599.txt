  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument of the `args` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the tail of the `args` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the `args` array and the value `1`, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
