 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the sine of `φ1` instead of the sine of the angular distance `δ`. This could lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the reciprocal of the cosine of `φ1` instead of the sine of the angular distance `δ`. This could lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the product of the sine of `δ` and the cosine of `φ1` instead of the sine of `φ1`. This could lead to incorrect calculations in
