  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const op.retain = lengths[Op.length(thisOp)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the current op instead of retaining the entire length of the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const op.retain = lengths[Op.layers(otherIter)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the other iterator's layers instead of retaining the entire length of the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const op.retain = lengths[Op.mostRetained(thisIter)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the most retained length of the current iterator instead of retaining the entire length of the document.

DONE.
