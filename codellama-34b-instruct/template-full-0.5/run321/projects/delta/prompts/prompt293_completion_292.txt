  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete()` method would remove the line from the document, whereas the original code fragment would append the line to the `line` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain()` method would keep the line in the document, whereas the original code fragment would append the line to the `line` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert()` method would insert an empty string into the document, whereas the original code fragment would append the line to the `line` variable.

DONE.
