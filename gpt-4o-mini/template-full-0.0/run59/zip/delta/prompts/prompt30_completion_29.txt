Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] === attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly include keys where the values are equal, thus potentially omitting keys that should be included when the values differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `attr[key]` as valid if it is explicitly `null`, ignoring other cases where `attr[key]` might be defined but not equal to `base[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `base[key]` is `undefined`, completely ignoring the comparison with `attr[key]`, which could lead to incorrect results when `attr[key]` has a defined value.

DONE.
