  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of the latitude of the first point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point. Using `sinφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of the latitude of the first point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point. Using `cosφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point, while `sinφ1` is the sine of the latitude of the first point
