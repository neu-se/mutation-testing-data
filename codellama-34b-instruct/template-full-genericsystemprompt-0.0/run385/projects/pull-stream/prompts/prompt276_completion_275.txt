  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called twice in a row, which would cause the stream to be read twice, potentially resulting in duplicate data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` would be called twice in a row, which would cause the chunk to be read twice, potentially resulting in duplicate data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be returned instead of a function, which would cause the stream to be read as if it were empty.

DONE.
