 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object` constructor instead of the `Q` object, which may not have the same `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `dispatch` method on the prototype of the promise object, which is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.dispatch(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive the `object` argument as the operation name and vice versa.

DONE.
