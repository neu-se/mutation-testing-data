  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the given promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns null, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the given promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a rejected promise, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the given promise.

DONE.
