 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.longStackSupport()
```
This would result in different behavior because it might enable long stack traces for all promises, which could affect performance and logging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `deferred` object, which could cause issues when trying to resolve or reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current context (`this`) as the `deferred` object, which could cause issues if the context is not an actual deferred object.

DONE.
