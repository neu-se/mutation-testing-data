  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the two inserts are not equal, instead of checking whether they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert == otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the two inserts are equal, instead of checking whether they are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the two inserts are strictly equal, instead of checking whether they are not equal.

DONE.
