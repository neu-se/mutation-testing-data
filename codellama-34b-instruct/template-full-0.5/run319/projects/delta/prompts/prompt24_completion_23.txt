  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` object is being used instead of the `b` object, which could cause the `diff` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would treat `null` values as equal to `undefined` values, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would treat `undefined` values as equal to `null` values, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
