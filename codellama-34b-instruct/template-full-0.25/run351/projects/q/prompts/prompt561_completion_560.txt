  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.value` is undefined, whereas `exception` is an object with a `value` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, whereas `exception` is an object with a `value` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.name` is a string, whereas `exception` is an object with a `value` property.

DONE.
