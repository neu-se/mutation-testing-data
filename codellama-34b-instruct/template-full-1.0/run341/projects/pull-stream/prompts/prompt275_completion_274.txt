  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the stream to be modified, potentially causing the tests to fail if they are not expecting the change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the stream to be modified, potentially causing the tests to fail if they are not expecting the change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tests to fail if the stream is not a array or does not have a `0` property.

DONE.
