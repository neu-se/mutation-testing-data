  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` would return the number of elements in the `ops` array, while `this.index` would return the current index of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index - 1]` would return the previous element in the `ops` array, while `this.index` would return the current index of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index + 1]` would return the next element in the `ops` array, while `this.index` would return the current index of the iterator.

DONE.
