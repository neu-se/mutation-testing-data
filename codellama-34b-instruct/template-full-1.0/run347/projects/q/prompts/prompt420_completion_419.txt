  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is not a method of the `Promise` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not a method of the `Promise` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is not a method of the `Promise` class, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
