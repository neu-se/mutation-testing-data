  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nextStream` function instead of the `nextChunk` function. This would cause the code to skip over the `nextChunk` function and go straight to the `nextStream` function, which could result in different behavior depending on what is inside the `nextStream` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_read` function with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the code to skip over the `nextChunk` function and go straight to the `nextStream` function. This
