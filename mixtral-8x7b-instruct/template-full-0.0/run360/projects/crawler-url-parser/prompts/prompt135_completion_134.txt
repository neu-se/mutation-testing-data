 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/'.concat(linkurl_path.match(/\/[^\/]*$/)[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it only keeps the last part of the path including the leading slash, instead of replacing the last part with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns only the last part of the path, without the leading slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.slice(-1 * (linkurl_path.match(/\/[^\/]*$/)[0].length))
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the last part of the path, starting from the last slash, including the slash.

DONE.
