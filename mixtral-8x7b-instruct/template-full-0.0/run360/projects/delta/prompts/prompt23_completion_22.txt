 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the 'key' property as a string literal instead of using the dynamic key from the `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the 'key' property from the `b` object instead of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the value to `null`, regardless of the original value in the `a` object.

DONE.
