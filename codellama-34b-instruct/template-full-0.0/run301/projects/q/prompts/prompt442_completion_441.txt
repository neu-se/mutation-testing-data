  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "baz"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

DONE.
