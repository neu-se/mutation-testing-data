  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment. The original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression that matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment uses a regular expression that matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, and replaces it with a backslash followed by the matched character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([^.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment. The original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression that matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment uses a regular expression that matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, and replaces it with a backslash followed by the matched character.
