  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called, and the `progress` event would not be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called, and the `progress` event would not be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with the value of the promise, and the `progress` event would be emitted with the value of the promise.

DONE.
