  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment `a + 1` adds 1 to the real part of the complex number, which changes the calculation of the exponential and subsequent complex operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, which changes the calculation of the exponential and subsequent complex operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment `Math.sin(a)` applies the sine function to the real part, which changes the calculation of the exponential and subsequent complex operations
