  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with `abort` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment calls `read` with `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a different callback function. The original code fragment calls `read` with a callback function that takes two arguments, `err` and `data`, while the new code fragment calls `read` with a callback function that takes one argument, `err`.

Option 3
