  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is checking if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` property, which is not the same as checking if the `tmpUrl.text` property includes the `text` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is checking if the `text` variable is not included in the `tmpUrl.text` property, which is not the same as checking if the `tmpUrl.text` property includes the `text` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is checking if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` property, but the `text` variable is converted to lowercase before being
