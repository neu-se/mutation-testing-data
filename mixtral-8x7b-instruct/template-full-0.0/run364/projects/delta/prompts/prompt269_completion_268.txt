 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty Delta instead of the original `retDelta.chop()` which returns a new Delta instance with the last operation removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new Delta instance with the same operations as `retDelta` instead of the original `retDelta.chop()` which removes the last operation from the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new Delta instance with the same operations as `retDelta` concatenated with an empty Delta instead of the original `retDelta.chop()` which removes the last operation from the Delta.

DONE.
