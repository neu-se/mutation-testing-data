 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of copying the properties of `newOp`. This could lead to unexpected results when processing the `newOp` later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `newOp` to null, which could cause issues when processing the `newOp` later in the code, as it would result in trying to access properties of a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `newOp` to the current `Delta` object, which could cause unexpected behavior when processing the `newOp` later in the code, as it would modify the `Delta` object itself instead of a copy.

DONE.
