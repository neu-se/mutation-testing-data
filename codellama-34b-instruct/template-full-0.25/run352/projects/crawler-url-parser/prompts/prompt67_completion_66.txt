  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` instead of `false`, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` instead of `false`, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` instead of `false`, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

DONE.
