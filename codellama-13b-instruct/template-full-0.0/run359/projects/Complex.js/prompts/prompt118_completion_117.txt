  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` property is not defined for the `Complex` object, and therefore the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is not defined for the `Complex` object, and therefore the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is not defined for the `Complex` object, and therefore the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
