  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it, causing the `fail` method to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise while `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress, causing the `fail` method to not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise while `undefined` would return `undefined`, causing the `fail` method to not be called.

DONE.
