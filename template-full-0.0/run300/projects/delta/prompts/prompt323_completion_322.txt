  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `base` Delta, and incrementing it by 1 would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `base` Delta, and decrementing it by 1 would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `base` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `base` Delta, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `
