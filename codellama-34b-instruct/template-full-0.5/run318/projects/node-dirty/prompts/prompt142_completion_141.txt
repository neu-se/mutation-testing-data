  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the error object to the callbacks, while the modified code fragment would pass `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass an error object with the message "Different error message" to the callbacks, while the modified code fragment would pass an error object with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass an error object to the callbacks, while the modified code fragment would pass `undefined` instead.

DONE.
