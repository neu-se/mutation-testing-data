 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the longitude difference as a positive value, ignoring the actual direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not correctly handle the case when `x` is zero, leading to incorrect results or errors when calculating the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not ensure the result is within the valid range for latitude (-90 to 90 degrees), potentially causing issues when creating or manipulating GeoPoint instances.

DONE.
