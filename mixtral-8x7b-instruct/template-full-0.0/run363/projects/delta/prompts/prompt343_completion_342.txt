 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getPrototypeOf(Delta).getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the prototype of `Delta` instead of the class itself, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors if the prototype does not have the `getHandler` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because it references a local variable `delta` instead of the `Delta` class, potentially leading to errors if the local variable is not defined or has a different type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Delta.prototype.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the prototype of the `Delta` class instead of the class itself, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results if the prototype does not have the `getHandler` method or if it has a different implementation.

DONE.
