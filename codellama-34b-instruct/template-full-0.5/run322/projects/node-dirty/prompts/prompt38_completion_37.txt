  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator of key-value pairs, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `Map` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator of keys in the `Map` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `Map` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator of values in the `Map` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `
