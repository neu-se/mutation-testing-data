  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`. If `mapper` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is not strictly equal to `null`. If `mapper` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this new code would not.
