  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `get`, which would cause the code to retrieve a property from the object instead of calling a method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `call`, which would cause the code to call the function with the specified `this` value and arguments, instead of calling a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `apply`, which would cause the code to call the function with the specified `this` value and arguments, instead of calling a method.

DONE.
