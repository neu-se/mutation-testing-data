  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment catches the exception and returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would throw the exception and cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment catches the exception and returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise with the exception as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment catches the exception and returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would return a resolved promise with the exception as the value.

DONE.
