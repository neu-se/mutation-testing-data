  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `then` method to handle the promise's resolution. The `noop` function is used as the fulfillment and rejection handlers, which means that the promise's value or reason will be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return promise; }, noop)

```
