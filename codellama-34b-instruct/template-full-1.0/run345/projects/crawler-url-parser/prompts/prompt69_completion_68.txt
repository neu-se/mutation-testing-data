  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the input as a URL string, whereas the original code treated it as an HTML element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the parsed base URL as the context for the URL, whereas the original code used the parsed current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the parsed base URL as the context for the URL, whereas the original code used the parsed current URL.

DONE.
