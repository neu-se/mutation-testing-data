  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` parameter is not being passed to the `then` method, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to report progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` parameter is being removed, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to report progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the parameters is being changed, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to report progress.

DONE.
