Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` performs a shallow copy of `b`, meaning that nested objects within `b` would not be deeply cloned, potentially leading to unintended mutations if the nested objects are modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because directly assigning `b` does not create a copy of the object, so any modifications to `attributes` would also affect `b`, leading to side effects that would not occur with a deep clone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...b }
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator creates a shallow copy of `b`, similar to `Object.assign`, which means that nested objects would still reference the same objects in memory, allowing for potential unintended changes to the original `b`.

DONE.
