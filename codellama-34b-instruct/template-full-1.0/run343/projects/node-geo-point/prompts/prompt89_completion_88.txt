  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosδ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function returns the cosine of an angle, which is always positive in the range [0, π], whereas the `sin` function returns the sine of an angle, which can be positive or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1` function returns the sine of the longitude of the first point, whereas the `cosφ1` function returns the cosine of the longitude of the first point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ1` function returns the longitude of the first point, whereas the `λ1` function returns the latitude of the first point.

DONE.
