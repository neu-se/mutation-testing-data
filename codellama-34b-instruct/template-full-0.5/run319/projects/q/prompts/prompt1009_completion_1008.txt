  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would extract the third argument onwards, instead of the second argument onwards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0)` would extract the first argument, instead of the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, -1)` would extract the last argument, instead of the second argument.

DONE.
