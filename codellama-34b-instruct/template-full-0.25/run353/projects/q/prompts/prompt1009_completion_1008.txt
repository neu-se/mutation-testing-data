  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the first two elements removed, instead of an array with the first element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with all but the last element removed, instead of an array with the first element removed.

DONE.
