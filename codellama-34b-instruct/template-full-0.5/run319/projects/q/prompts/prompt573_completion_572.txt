  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive a `null` value as its first argument, which may cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive an empty array as its first argument, which may cause it to produce unexpected results or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive an `undefined` value as its first argument, which may cause it to produce unexpected results or throw an error.

DONE.
