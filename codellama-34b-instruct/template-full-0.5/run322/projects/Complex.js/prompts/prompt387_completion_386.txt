  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are different mathematical functions, and using `sinh` instead of `cosh` would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are different mathematical functions, and using `tanh` instead of `cosh` would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `1/cosh` are different mathematical functions, and using `1/cosh` instead of `cosh` would produce a different output.

DONE.
