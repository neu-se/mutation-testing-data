  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'phi' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `phi` property is being checked on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in b && 'phi' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `r` and `phi` properties are being checked on the wrong objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'phi' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `r` and `phi` properties are being checked on the same object, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
