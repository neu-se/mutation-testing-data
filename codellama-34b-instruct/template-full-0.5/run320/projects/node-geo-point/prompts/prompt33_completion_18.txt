  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of `point2` instead of `point1`, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the longitude of `point1`, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude of `point1` by 2, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
