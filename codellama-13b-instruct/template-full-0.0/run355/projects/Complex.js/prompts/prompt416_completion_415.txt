  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a * a + 1` is always positive, while `a * a - 1` can be negative. This could cause issues in the calculation of the square root, which is used in the `acosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a * a + 1` is always positive, while `a * a + 2` can be positive or negative. This could cause issues in the calculation of the square root, which is used in the `acosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 2
