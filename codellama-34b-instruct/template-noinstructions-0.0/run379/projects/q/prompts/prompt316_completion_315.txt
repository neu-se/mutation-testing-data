  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would be called even if it is not defined, which could cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof inspect !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would not be called if it is not a function, which could cause the promise to never resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would be called even if it is null, which could cause an error.

DONE.
