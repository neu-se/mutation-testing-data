  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling `parseFloat` on a string, while this new code fragment is calling it on the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat("0")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling `parseFloat` on a string, while this new code fragment is calling it on the string "0".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling `parseFloat` on a string, while this new code fragment is calling it on the value `NaN`.

DONE.
