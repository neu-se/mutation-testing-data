  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which is not a valid method. The corrected code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which is a valid method.

DONE.
