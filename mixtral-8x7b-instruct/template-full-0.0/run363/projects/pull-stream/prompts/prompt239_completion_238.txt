 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with two arguments (end and data), while the modified fragment only passes the data argument. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with two arguments (end and data), while the modified fragment only passes a boolean value. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called with two arguments, or if it expects the first argument to be a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with the end and data arguments as they are passed to the inner function, while the modified fragment modifies the data argument before passing it to the callback.
