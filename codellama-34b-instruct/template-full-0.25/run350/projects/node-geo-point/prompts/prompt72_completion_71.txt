  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function would round the distance down to the nearest integer, potentially resulting in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance would be doubled, potentially resulting in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance would be increased by 1, potentially resulting in a different destination point.

DONE.
