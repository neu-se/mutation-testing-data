  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the asynchronous `readFile` function to a synchronous `readFileSync` function, which could lead to different race conditions and timing issues in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `readFile` function a bound function, which would change the value of `this` inside the function and potentially lead to different behavior when interacting with the file system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createReadStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function that reads the file from a synchronous `readFile` function to an asynchronous `createReadStream` function, which could lead to different race conditions and timing issues in the code.

DONE.
