 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would initialize `z` as `null` instead of creating a new object with `re` and `im` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would initialize `z` as an empty object instead of creating a new object with `re` and `im` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would initialize `z` as a `Date` object instead of creating a new object with `re` and `im` properties.

By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with any of these options, the behavior of the `Complex` constructor changes, and the tests should fail, indicating potential weaknesses in the test suite.

DONE.
