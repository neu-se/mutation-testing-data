  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with an incorrect value for the number of items in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with an incorrect value for the number of items in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with an incorrect value for the number of items in the database.

DONE.
