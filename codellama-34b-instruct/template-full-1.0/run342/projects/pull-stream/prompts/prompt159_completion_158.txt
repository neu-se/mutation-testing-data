  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a different value than the original `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a different value than the original `_value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a different value than the original `_value` because it would convert the value to uppercase.

DONE.
