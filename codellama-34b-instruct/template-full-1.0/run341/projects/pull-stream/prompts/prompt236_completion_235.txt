  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed the `end` argument to the `cb` function if it was truthy, but this change passes both `end` and `data` arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed the `end` argument to the `cb` function if it was truthy, but this change passes either `end` or `data` argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? data : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed the `end` argument to the `cb` function if it was truthy, but this change passes `data` if `end` is truthy, and `null` if it is falsy, which could potentially change the behavior of
