  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the type of `nextOp.retain` being an object and the value of `nextOp.retain` not being null, while this replacement only checks for the type of `nextOp.retain` being a number. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where `nextOp.retain` is an object but not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the type of `nextOp.retain` being an object and the value of `nextOp.retain` not being null, while this replacement only checks for the type of `nextOp.retain` being an object and the value of `nextOp.retain` not being undefined.
