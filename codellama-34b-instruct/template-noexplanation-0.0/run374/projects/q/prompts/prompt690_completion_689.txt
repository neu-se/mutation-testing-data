  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it slices the `arguments` array starting from the second element instead of the first. This could potentially cause the `fcall` method to behave differently than expected if it is called with a different number of arguments than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it slices the `arguments` array starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element. This could potentially cause the `fcall` method to behave differently than expected if it is called with a different number of arguments than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
