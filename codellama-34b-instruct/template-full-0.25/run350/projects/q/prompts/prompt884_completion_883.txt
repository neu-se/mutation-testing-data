  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that rejects the promise with the specified reason, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the provided arguments to the promise and returns a new promise for the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the provided callback, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the provided arguments to the promise and returns a new promise for the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the provided callback if the promise is rejected, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the provided arguments to the promise and returns a new promise for the result.

DONE.
