  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `spec` string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of substrings based on the `/` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `spec` string into an array of substrings based on the `/` character, but it would also include the `/` character in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//).filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `spec` string into an array of substrings based on the `/` character, remove any empty strings from the resulting array, and then return the resulting array.

DONE.
