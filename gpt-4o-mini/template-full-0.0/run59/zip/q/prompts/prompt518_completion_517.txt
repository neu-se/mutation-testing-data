Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject, leading to a successful completion of the promise even when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the notify method instead of rejecting the promise, which may lead to the promise being neither fulfilled nor rejected, potentially causing unexpected behavior in promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("An error occurred")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a specific error message instead of the original exception, which could change how error handling is performed downstream in the promise chain.

DONE.
