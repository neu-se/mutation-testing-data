  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `baseIndex` to get the index of the current element in the base Delta, while `baseIndex + 1` would get the index of the next element. This could cause the code to skip over certain elements in the base Delta, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `baseIndex` to get the index of the current element in the base Delta, while `baseIndex - 1` would get the index of the previous element. This could cause the code to process the previous element instead of the current one, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `baseIndex` to get the index of the current element in the base Delta, while
