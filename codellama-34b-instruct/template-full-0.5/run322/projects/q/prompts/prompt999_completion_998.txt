  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used instead of the `fail` method, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is used instead of the `fail` method, which would cause the promise to resolve or reject regardless of the result of the dispatch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used instead of the `fail` method, which would cause the promise to reject with a different error.

DONE.
