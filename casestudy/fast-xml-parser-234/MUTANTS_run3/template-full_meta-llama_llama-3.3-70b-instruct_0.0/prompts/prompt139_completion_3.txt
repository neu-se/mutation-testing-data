Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-zA-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any trailing letters from the string `val` instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\d+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all digits from the string `val` instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^0-9.]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all non-numeric characters (except for the decimal point) from the string `val` instead of removing leading zeros after a decimal point.

DONE.
