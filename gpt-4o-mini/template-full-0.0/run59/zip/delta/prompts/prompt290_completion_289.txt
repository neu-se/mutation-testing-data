Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to always consume one element, potentially skipping over parts of the `Delta` that should be processed, leading to incomplete or incorrect line handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next element without advancing the iterator, which means the same element could be processed multiple times, causing incorrect results in the line processing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` does not advance the iterator at all, effectively ignoring the current operation and potentially leading to an infinite loop or failure to process any operations in the `Delta`.

DONE.
