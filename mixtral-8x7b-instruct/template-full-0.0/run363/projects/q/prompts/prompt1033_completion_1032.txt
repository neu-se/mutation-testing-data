 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Hand-crafted error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object with a specific message, instead of just passing the string "error". This could cause issues if the error handling code expects a specific error object type or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` instead of an error object. This could cause issues if the error handling code expects an error object and tries to access its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(null, function() { throw new Error("Error message") })
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the error creation in a `Q.when` call, which is a utility function to handle both promises and immediate values. The second argument is a function that throws an error, which is different from passing an error object directly. This could cause issues if the error handling
