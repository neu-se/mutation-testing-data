  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the deprecated timezones, whereas the original code fragment returns all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the timezones that are in the `options.timezones` array, whereas the original code fragment returns all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.timezones.filter(tz => !tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the timezones that are not deprecated, whereas the original code fragment returns all timezones.

DONE.
