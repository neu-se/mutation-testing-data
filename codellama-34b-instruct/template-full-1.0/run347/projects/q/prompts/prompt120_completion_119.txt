  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnConstProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnConstProperty` is not a valid property of `Object.prototype`, so the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.g
```
This would result in different behavior because `g` is not a property of the `hasOwnProperty` function, so the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `undefined` instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is not the same as `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, so the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would not have the expected behavior when called with an array.

DONE.
