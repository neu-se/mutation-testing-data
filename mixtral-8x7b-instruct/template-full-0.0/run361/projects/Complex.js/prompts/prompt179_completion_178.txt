 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison in the `if` statement will always be true, since `d` is an object property that can be any numeric value, including infinity. Adding 1 to it will make the condition always true, causing the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` even when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-d
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison in the `if` statement will always be false, since `d` is an object property that can be any numeric value, including infinity. Multiplying it by -1 will make the condition always false, causing the function to skip the division part and return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison in the `if` statement will always be false, since `this
