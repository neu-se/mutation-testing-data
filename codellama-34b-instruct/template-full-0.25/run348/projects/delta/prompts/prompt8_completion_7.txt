  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `!= null`, which means that the value is not null or undefined, while the new code fragment checks for `=== null`, which means that the value is exactly null. This change would cause the code to treat null values differently than undefined values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `!= null`, which means that the value is not null or undefined, while the new code fragment checks for `!== undefined`, which means that the value is not undefined. This change would cause the code to treat undefined values differently than null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== null && attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `!= null`, which means that the value is not null or undefined, while the
