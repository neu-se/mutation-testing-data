  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the `sin` function to return a different value, which would in turn cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is not equal to `b`. Using `b + 1` instead of `b` would cause the `sin` function to return a different value, which would in turn cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is not equal to `b`. Using `Math.sin(b)` instead of `b` would cause the `Complex`
