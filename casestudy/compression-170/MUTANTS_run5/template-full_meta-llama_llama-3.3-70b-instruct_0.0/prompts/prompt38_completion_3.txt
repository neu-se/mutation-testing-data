Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code sent in the response would be incremented by 1, potentially changing the interpretation of the response by the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
201
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code sent in the response would always be 201 (Created), regardless of the original status code set in the response object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
req.method === 'GET' ? 200 : 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code sent in the response would depend on the request method, potentially leading to inconsistent or incorrect responses.

DONE.
