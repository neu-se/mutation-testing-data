  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using a base of 1 instead of 2, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using a base of 3 instead of 2, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the square root of 2 instead of 2, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

DONE.
