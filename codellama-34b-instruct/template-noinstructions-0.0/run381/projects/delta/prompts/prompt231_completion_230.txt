  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the next operation in the other iterator, regardless of the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the current operation in the this iterator, regardless of the length of the next operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference between the length of the next operation in the other iterator and the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

DONE.
