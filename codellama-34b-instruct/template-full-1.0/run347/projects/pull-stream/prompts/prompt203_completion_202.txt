  Sure, here are three options for the mutation testing for the provided code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` statement would be skipped, and the callback would be called with `null` instead of the expected `end` or `aborted` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` statement would be skipped, and the callback would be called with `undefined` instead of the expected `end` or `aborted` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` statement would be skipped, and the callback would be called with `true` instead of the expected `end` or `aborted` value.

DONE.
