  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+\/$, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+\/$, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original pattern.

DONE.
