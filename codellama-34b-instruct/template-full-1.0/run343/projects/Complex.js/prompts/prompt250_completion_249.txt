  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` are inverses of each other, so using `Math.sin` instead of `Math.cos` would cause the formula to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is not the inverse of `Math.cos` and would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, and would not produce a deterministic result like the original formula.

DONE.
