  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `1 + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `"Q"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `Q.reject("Error")` is a rejected promise with the reason "Error".

DONE.
