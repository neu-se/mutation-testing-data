  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("PLACEHOLDER was not replaced in spawn()"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spawn` function expects `makeGenerator` to be a generator function, but instead it is a function that returns a rejected promise with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spawn` function expects `makeGenerator` to be a generator function, but instead it is a function that resolves the deferred promise returned by `Q.deferred()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spawn` function expects `makeGenerator` to be a generator function, but instead it is a function that returns a new generator function that will not have the same behavior as the original generator function.

DONE.
