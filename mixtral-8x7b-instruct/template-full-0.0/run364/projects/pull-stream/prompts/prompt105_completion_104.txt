 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an integer instead of a null value to the `drain` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the `drain` function is not equipped to handle non-null inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a boolean value instead of a null value to the `drain` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the `drain` function is not equipped to handle non-null inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an empty function instead of a null value to the `drain` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the `drain` function is not equipped to handle non-null inputs.

DONE.
