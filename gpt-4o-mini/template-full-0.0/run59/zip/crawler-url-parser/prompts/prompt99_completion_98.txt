Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value associated with `currentUrl.url` is `undefined` instead of checking if the key exists in the map, which could lead to incorrect handling of existing URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition that checks if the map has any entries, which could prevent the addition of new URLs if the map is not empty, leading to potential data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the map is empty instead of checking for the existence of the URL, which would cause the logic to behave incorrectly when there are existing URLs in the map.

DONE.
