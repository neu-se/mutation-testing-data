  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `Object.values()` instead of `Object.keys()`. This change can cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the specific behavior of `Object.keys()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it returns the length of the array returned by `Object.keys()` instead of the array itself. This change can cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the specific behavior of `Object.keys()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).reverse()
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it returns the keys of the object in reverse order instead of the original order. This change can cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the specific behavior of `Object.keys()`.

DONE.
