  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` argument is missing, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` argument is added, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"foo"` argument is added, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an additional argument.

DONE.
