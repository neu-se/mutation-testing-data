  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of resolved with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, and the error would be propagated to the next `then` method in the chain.

DONE.
