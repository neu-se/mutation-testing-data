  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `Number.isFinite` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the input is a finite number, and `false` when it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a) && Number.isFinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would require both `a` and `b` to be finite numbers, whereas the original code only required `a` to be a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a) || Number.isFinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would require either `a` or `b` to be a finite number, whereas the original code required both `a` and `b` to be finite
