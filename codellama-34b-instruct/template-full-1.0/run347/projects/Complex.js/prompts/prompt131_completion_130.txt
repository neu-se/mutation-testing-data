  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` would return `true` if the value is negative zero, while `isInfinite` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` would return the absolute value of the number, while `isInfinite` would return `true` for positive and negative infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['NaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` would return `true` for any value that can't be converted to a number, while `isInfinite` would return `false` for any finite number.

DONE.
