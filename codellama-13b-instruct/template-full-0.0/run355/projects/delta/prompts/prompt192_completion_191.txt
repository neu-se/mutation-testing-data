  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext() &&
            isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is called with the last element of `delta.ops` and `newOp`, which may not be the same as the last element of `other.ops`. This could cause the `compose` method to return a delta that is not the composition of the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
            isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is called with the last element of `delta.ops` and `newOp`, which may not be the same as the last element of `other.ops`. This could cause the `compose` method to return a delta that is not the composition of the two deltas.
