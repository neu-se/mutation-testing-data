  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `arr.push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `arr.push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `arr.push` adds an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
