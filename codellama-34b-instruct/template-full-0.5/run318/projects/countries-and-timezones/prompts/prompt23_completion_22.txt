  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the offset to be twice as large as it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` variable is used instead of the `utcOffset` variable, which would cause the offset to be different than it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` variable is added to the `dstOffset` variable, which would cause the offset to be different than it should be.

DONE.
