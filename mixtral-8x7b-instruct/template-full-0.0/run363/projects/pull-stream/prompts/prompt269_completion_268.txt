 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with an error if the stream ends, while this change would cause it to continue trying to read from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Stream ended')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with an error if the stream ends, but this change would provide a specific error message indicating that the stream ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with an error if the stream ends, while this change would cause it to continue trying to read from the stream, but with a null value instead of an error.

DONE.
