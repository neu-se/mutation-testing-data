  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true for one additional iteration, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true for one additional iteration, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be false for one additional iteration, potentially leading to a missed iteration.

DONE.
