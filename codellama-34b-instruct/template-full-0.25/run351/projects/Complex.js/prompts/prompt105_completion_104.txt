  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
