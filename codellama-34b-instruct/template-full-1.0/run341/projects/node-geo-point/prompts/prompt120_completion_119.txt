  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
calculateDestination(this, distance, -bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `bearing` as a positive angle, while this fragment uses `-bearing` as a negative angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `bearing` as a single angle, while this fragment uses `bearing * 2` as a doubled angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
calculateDestination(this, distance, Math.PI - bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `bearing` as an angle in radians, while this fragment uses `Math.PI - bearing` as an angle in radians plus pi.

DONE.
