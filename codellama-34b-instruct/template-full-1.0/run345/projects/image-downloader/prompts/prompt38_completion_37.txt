  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some/random/path/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file to be written to a different path, rather than the expected destination path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some/random/file.txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file to be written to a different name, rather than the expected destination file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `createWriteStream()` method to fail, as it expects a valid file path or file handle as its first argument.

DONE.
