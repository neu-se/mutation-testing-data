  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method returns the number of elements in the array, but adding 1 to it would make the returned value always be 1 greater than the actual length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method returns the number of elements in the array, but subtracting 1 from it would make the returned value always be 1 less than the actual length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method returns the number of elements in the array, but multiplying it by 2 would make the returned value always be twice the actual length.

DONE.
