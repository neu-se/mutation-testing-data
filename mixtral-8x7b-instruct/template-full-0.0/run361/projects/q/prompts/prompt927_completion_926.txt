 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This might cause issues if the code relies on custom behavior provided by the array\_slice function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Math global's floor method, which is a completely different function used for rounding down numbers. This would cause a syntax error and break the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.prototype.array_slice
