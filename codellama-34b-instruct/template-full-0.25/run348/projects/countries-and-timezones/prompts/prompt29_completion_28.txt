  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60, while this replacement code fragment takes the remainder of the offset divided by 60. This could cause the resulting offset to be different from the original, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60, while this replacement code fragment multiplies the offset by 60. This could cause the resulting offset to be different from the original, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60, while this replacement code fragment adds 60 to the offset. This could cause the resulting offset to be different from the original, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
