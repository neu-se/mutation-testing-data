  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `b`, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of `b`, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 from the value of `b`, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

DONE.
