  Option 1: The `Placeholder` can be replaced with:
```
archiver.Archiver('zip', { zlib: { level: 9 } });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `level` property of the `zlib` object is set to `9`, which is higher than the default compression level of `5`. This will result in a larger output file.

Option 2: The `Placeholder` can be replaced with:
```
archiver.Archiver('zip', { store: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `store` property is set to `true`, which means that the files will be stored without compression. This will result in a larger output file.

Option 3: The `Placeholder` can be replaced with:
```
archiver.Archiver('zip', { comment: 'This is a comment' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `comment` property is set to a string, which will be included as a comment in the output file. This will not affect the compression level or the size of the output file.

DONE.
