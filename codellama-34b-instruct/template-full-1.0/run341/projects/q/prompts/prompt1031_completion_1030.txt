  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"value", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` as the second argument for the nodeback function, while this alternative would return `"value"` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` as the second argument for the nodeback function, while this alternative would return `undefined` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` as the second argument for the nodeback function, while this alternative would return `value` as the second argument.

DONE.
