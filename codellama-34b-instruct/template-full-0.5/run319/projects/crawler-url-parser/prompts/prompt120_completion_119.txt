  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol, baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.protocol` and `baseUrl.protocol` are different values, and the function `gettype` relies on these values to determine the type of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host, baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.host` and `baseUrl.host` are different values, and the function `gettype` relies on these values to determine the type of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path, baseUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.path` and `baseUrl.path` are different values, and the function `gettype` relies on these values to determine the type of the link.

DONE.
