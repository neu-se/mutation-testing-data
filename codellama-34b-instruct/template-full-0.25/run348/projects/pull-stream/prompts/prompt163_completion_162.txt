  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!array` checks if the `array` variable is falsy, while `array.length === 0` checks if the `array` is an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!array` checks if the `array` variable is falsy, while `array.length < 0` checks if the `array` is an array with a negative length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!array` checks if the `array` variable is falsy, while `array.length === 1` checks if the `array` is an array with exactly one element.

DONE.
