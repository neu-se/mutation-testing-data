  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value that would always be considered "truthy" in a conditional statement, whereas `exception` is an object that could have properties that could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number that would always be considered "truthy" in a conditional statement, whereas `exception` is an object that could have properties that could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"error"` is a string that could be used to represent an error message, whereas `exception` is an object that could have properties that could result in different behavior.

DONE.
