  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length <= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow arrays with less than two elements to pass through, while the original code fragment only allows arrays with exactly two elements to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length != 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow arrays with any number of elements to pass through, while the original code fragment only allows arrays with exactly two elements to pass through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow arrays with less than two elements to pass through, while the original code fragment only allows arrays with exactly two elements to pass through.

DONE.
