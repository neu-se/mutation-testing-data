  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true` if `baseUrlStr` is not empty, regardless of the value of `parsedUrl.host`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && !baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the value of `baseUrlStr`, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true` if `baseUrlStr` is empty, regardless of the value of `parsedUrl.host`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used to check if `baseUrlStr` is not empty, which would cause
