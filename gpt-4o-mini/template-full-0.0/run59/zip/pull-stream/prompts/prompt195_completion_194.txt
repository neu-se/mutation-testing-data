Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to always be invoked with `true`, regardless of the actual state of `aborted`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the callback instead of the actual `aborted` value, which could lead to confusion about whether the operation was aborted or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the callback to be invoked when the operation is not aborted, which is contrary to the intended logic of handling an aborted state.

DONE.
