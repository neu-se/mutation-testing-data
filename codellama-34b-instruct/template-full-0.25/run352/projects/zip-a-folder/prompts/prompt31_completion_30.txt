  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` would turn off the event listener for the `close` event, whereas `output.on` would turn it on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.once` would add a one-time event listener for the `close` event, whereas `output.on` would add a persistent event listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.emit` would emit the `close` event immediately, whereas `output.on` would wait for the event to be triggered.

DONE.
