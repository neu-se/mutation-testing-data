  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable [string and value pairs], while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties) found directly on a given object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of only the enumerable property names.

DONE.
