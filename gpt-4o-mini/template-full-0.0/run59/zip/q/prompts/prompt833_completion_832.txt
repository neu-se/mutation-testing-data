Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the fulfillment handler instead of handling progress notifications, potentially leading to unhandled progress events.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would effectively ignore the progress handler, meaning that any progress notifications would not be processed, which could lead to missed updates in a promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also skip the progress handler, similar to passing `null`, and would not allow any progress notifications to be handled, potentially leading to a lack of feedback in long-running asynchronous operations.

DONE.
