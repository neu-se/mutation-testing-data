  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method will cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` would fulfill it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method will cause the promise to emit a notification, whereas `resolve` or `reject` would fulfill or reject it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that will reject the promise, whereas `deferred.resolve` would fulfill it.

DONE.
