  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the second element of the `rule` array, rather than the first element, which is the regular expression that is used to match the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the third element of the `rule` array, rather than the first element, which is the regular expression that is used to match the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the fourth element of the `rule` array, rather than the first element, which is the regular expression that is used to match the input word.

DONE.
