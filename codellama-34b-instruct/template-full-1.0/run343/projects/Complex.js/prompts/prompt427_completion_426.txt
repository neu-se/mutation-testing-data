  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(places)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(places)` will return a different value than `10` when `places` is not a perfect square.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(100, places)` would return a different value than `Math.pow(10, places)` when `places` is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(Infinity, places)` would return different values than `Math.pow(10, places)` for different values of `places`.

DONE.
