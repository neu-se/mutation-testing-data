  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an error, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(123)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a value of 123, which would cause the test to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(Q.resolve(123), function(value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a value of 123, which would cause the test to pass, but the test would also check that the value is incremented by 1, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
