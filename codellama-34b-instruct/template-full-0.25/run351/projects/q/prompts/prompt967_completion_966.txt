  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `args` array, which could potentially break the function's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `args` array, which could potentially break the function's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `args` array, which could potentially break the function's functionality.

DONE.
