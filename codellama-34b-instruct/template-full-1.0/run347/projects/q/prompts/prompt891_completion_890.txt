  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Q(callback).nfapply(args.reverse());
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the `nfapply` method would be reversed, which could cause issues if the function being called is expecting a specific order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Q(callback).nfapply(args.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `nfapply` method would be omitted, which could cause issues if the function being called is expecting a specific number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Q(callback).nfapply([args[0], ...args.slice(1)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `nfapply` method would be separated from the rest of the arguments, which could cause issues if the function being called is expecting a specific order of arguments.
