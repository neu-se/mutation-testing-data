  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error as the reason.

DONE.
