Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "(\n)" in the stringify function. This would result in different behavior because it would match the string "\n" instead of a new line character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "\\n" in the stringify function. This would result in different behavior because it would match the string "\n" instead of a new line character.
