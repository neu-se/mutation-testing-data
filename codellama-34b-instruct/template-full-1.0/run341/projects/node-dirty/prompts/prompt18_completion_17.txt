  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array from `cbs` instead of modifying the original one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array concatenated with the original one, instead of modifying the original one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with all elements of `cbs` that pass the filter function `() => true`, instead of modifying the original one.

DONE.
