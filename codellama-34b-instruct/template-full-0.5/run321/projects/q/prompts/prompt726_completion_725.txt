  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `snapshot.value` would always be `undefined`, since `snapshot` is an object with no properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` would always return a promise, even if the promise is already settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.state)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` would always be `undefined`, since `promise` is an object with no properties.

DONE.
