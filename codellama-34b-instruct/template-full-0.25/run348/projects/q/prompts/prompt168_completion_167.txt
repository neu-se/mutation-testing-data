  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only filter out lines that are internal frames and not Node frames, whereas the original code fragment filters out both internal and Node frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only filter out lines that are Node frames and not internal frames, whereas the original code fragment filters out both internal and Node frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) || isNodeFrame(line) || line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only filter out lines that are either internal or Node frames, whereas the original code fragment filters out both internal and Node frames.

DONE.
