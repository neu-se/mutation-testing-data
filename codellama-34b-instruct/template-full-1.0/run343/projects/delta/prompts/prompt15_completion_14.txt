  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not a function, rather than not an object. This would cause the method to return a different value if `a` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'function' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would additionally check if `a` is not null. This would cause the method to return a different value if `a` is a function or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'function' && a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not equal to the string 'function', rather than checking if it is not an object. This would cause the method to return a different value if `a` is a function or the string 'function'.

DONE.
