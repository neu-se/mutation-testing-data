  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would be rejected, even if all the promises in the array are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would be rejected with a rejection reason, even if all the promises in the array are resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would be rejected with a rejection reason, even if all the promises in the array are resolved.

DONE.
