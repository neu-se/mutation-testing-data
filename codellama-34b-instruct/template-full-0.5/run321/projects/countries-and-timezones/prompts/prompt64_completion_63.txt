  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different object reference, potentially causing issues in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], { ...options, deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different options object to the `deliverCountry` function, potentially causing it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `deliverCountry` function with a different set of arguments, potentially causing it to return a different result.

DONE.
