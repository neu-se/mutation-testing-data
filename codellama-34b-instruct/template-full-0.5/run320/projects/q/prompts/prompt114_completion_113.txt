  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `hasOwnProperty` method, unlike `Object.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `hasOwnProperty` method, unlike `Object.prototype`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with no prototype, unlike `Object.prototype`.

DONE.
