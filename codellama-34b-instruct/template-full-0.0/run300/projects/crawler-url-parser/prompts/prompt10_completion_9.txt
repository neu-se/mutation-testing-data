  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://').replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `replace` method would replace the `http://` protocol with `http://` again, resulting in a duplicate protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `https://` protocol would be used instead of `http://`, which could cause issues with SSL certificates or other security measures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ftp://` protocol would be used instead of `http://`, which could cause issues with file transfer protocols or other network-related issues.

DONE.
