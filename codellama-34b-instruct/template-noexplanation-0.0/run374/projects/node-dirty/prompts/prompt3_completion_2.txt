  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This change will cause the `set` method to delete the key from the map even if the value is `null`, which is different from the original behavior where the key is only deleted if the value is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `set` method to delete the key from the map only if the value is not `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior where the key is deleted if the value is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This change will cause the `set` method to delete the key from the map only if the value is of type `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior where the key is deleted if the value is `undefined`.

DONE.
