  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(new Error('Simulated error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error in the `end` method of the write stream, which would cause the `close` method to be called with an error argument, which would result in the `error` event being emitted with the simulated error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null, new Error('Simulated error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error in the `end` method of the write stream, but without passing an error argument, which would cause the `close` method to be called with a null error argument, which would result in the `error` event being emitted with the simulated error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null, new Error('Simulated error'), {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error
