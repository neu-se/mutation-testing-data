  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would always return `false` if the `insert` property of the `op` object is not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.attributes && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would always return `false` if the `attributes` property of the `op` object is not defined or has a length of zero.

DONE.
