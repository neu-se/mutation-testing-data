  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.pop()` would remove the last element of the array, whereas `arr.push()` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr[0]` would return the first element of the array, whereas `arr.push()` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `arr.push()` would add an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
