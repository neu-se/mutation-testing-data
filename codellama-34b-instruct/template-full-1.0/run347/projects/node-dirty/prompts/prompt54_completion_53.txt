  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `on` is used to register event listeners, whereas `once` is used to register event listeners that are executed only once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is used to emit an event, whereas `on` and `once` are used to register event listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.remove
```
This would result in different behavior because `remove` is used to remove event listeners, whereas `on` and `once` are used to register event listeners.

DONE.
