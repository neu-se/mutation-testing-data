  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a different function than `onFulfilled`, and it would be called when the promise is rejected, rather than when it is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` is a different function than `onFulfilled`, and it would be called when the promise makes progress, rather than when it is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, and it would be called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected, rather than `onFulfilled` or `onRejected`.

DONE.
