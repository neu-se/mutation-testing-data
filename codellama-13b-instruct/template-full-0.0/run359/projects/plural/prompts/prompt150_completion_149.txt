  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be made with the same arguments as the original code, which would cause the function to return the plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be made with only one argument, which would cause the function to return the plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be made with two arguments, the first being the word and the second being the number 1, which would cause the function to return the singular form of the word.

DONE.
