 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces the possibility of returning an invalid value (`NaN`), which could cause unexpected results in further calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces the possibility of returning a very large value (`Infinity`), which could cause unexpected results in further calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a negative value, which could cause unexpected results in further calculations, especially when the `round` function is used for negative numbers.

DONE.
