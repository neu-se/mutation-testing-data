  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unintended consequences.

DONE.
