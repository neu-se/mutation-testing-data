  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `ended` variable is set to `true` when the `end` parameter is truthy. If `ended` is set to `undefined`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, and the `read` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `ended` variable is set to `true` when the `end` parameter is truthy. If `ended` is set to `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, and the `read` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN
