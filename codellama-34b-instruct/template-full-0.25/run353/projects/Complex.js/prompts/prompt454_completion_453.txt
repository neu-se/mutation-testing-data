  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is not infinity or NaN, while `isNaN` checks if the number is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinity, while `isNaN` checks if the number is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the number is zero, while `isNaN` checks if the number is NaN.

DONE.
