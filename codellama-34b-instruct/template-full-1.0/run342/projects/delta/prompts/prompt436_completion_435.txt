This would result in different behavior because `delete` is an operator in JavaScript and it's not possible for it to be a string. Therefore, the condition will always be false, and the `return` statement inside the `if` block will never be executed.

```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method in the `Op` class, and it's not possible for it to be a number. Therefore, the condition will always be
