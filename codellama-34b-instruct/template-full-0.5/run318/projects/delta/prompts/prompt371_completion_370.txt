  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the current operation before using it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the current iterator, but it would not advance the iterator.

DONE.
