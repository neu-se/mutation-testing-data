  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is not a valid method for the "dispatch" function, while "post" is. This would cause an error to be thrown when the "ninvoke" method is called with a "send" argument, which would indicate a bug in the code.
