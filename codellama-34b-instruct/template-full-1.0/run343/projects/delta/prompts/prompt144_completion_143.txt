  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstLeft` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.hasNext()` may not always be true, which would cause the while loop to execute indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof firstOther === 'number') {
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther` is defined as `undefined` if `otherIter.peek()` returns `null`, and the comparison would always be false.

DONE.
