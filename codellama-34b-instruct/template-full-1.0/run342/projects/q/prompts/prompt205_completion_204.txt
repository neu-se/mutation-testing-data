  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var attempt1 = /at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement matches only one character after "at" construct in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var attempt2 = /at .+ \((.+):{1,3}\)$/.exec(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement matches more than one character after "at" construct in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var attempt3 = /at .+ \((.+):(\d+): hour-minute-second\)$/.exec(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement matches more than one group of characters after "at" construct in the stack trace.

DONE.
