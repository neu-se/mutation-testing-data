Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `nextOp` to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end, altering the order of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(0, 0, nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `splice` to insert `nextOp` at the start of the `ops` array, which is functionally similar to `unshift`, but may lead to confusion regarding the intent of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value into the `ops` array instead of the `nextOp`, which could lead to unexpected results when processing the operations later.

DONE.
