  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is in the progress state instead of a fulfilled or rejected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a fulfilled promise with a rejection reason instead of a fulfilled promise with a resolution value.

DONE.
