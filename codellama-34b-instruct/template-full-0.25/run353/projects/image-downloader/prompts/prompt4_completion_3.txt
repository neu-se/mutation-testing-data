  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this replacement checks if its length is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it does not start with a forward slash.

DONE.
