  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"nextTick"
```
This would result in different behavior because "nextTick" is not a function and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"prev"
```
This would result in different behavior because "prev" does not correspond to any existing promise method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because "all" is a valid promise method that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved.

DONE.
