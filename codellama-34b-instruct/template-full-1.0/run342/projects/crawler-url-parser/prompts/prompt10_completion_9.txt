  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a portion of the string, whereas the `replace` method replaces the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.charAt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `charAt` method returns a single character from the string, whereas the `replace` method replaces the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` method searches for a substring within the string, whereas the `replace` method replaces the entire string.

DONE.
