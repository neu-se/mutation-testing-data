  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the attribute `insert` is accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the `ops` property of the `other` object is accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Deltanull
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `null` value, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
