  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(offset + length)`, which would result in a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(length - offset)`, which would result in a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(offset * length)`, which would result in a different value than the original code.

DONE.
