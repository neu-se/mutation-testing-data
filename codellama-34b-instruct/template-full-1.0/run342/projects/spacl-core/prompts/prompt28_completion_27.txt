  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `true`, which means that the test will pass if the path ends with a slash. The modified code fragment is `false`, which means that the test will fail if the path ends with a slash. This change would indicate that the test suite is not properly checking for paths that end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string ends with a slash. The modified code fragment checks if the string does not end with a slash. This change would indicate that the test suite is not properly checking for paths that do not end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.endsWith('$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string ends with a slash. The modified code fragment checks if the string ends with a dollar sign. This change
