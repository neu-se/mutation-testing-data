  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` argument, which would return a timezone object with the given name, rather than returning the `timezone` object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the given name from the `timezones` object, rather than calling the `getTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] || getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first check if the timezone object with the given name exists in the `timezones` object, and if it doesn't, it would call the `getTimezone` function to retrieve the timezone object.

DONE.
