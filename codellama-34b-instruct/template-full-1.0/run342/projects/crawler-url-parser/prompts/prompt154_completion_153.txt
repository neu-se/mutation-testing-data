  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]+)\/[^\/]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the last `\/` and any non-`\/` characters following it, while the new fragment captures any non-`\/` character followed by a trailing `\/`, potentially matching a different portion of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]+)\/([^\/]+)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the last `\/` and any non-`\/` characters following it, while the new fragment captures any non-`\/` character followed by a trailing `\/` and any additional non-`\/` characters after that, potentially matching a different portion of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]+)\/([^\/]+)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
