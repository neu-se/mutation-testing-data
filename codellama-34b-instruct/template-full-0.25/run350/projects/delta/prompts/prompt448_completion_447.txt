  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.length` is a method that returns the length of the `op` object, whereas `op` is an object that contains the `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.length()` is a method that returns the length of the `op` object, whereas `op` is an object that contains the `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.length - 1` is a different value than `op.length`, and would cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value.

DONE.
