  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the `error` object passed as an argument, while this code fragment would reject the promise with a new `Error` object with the message "Test error".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value returned by the `callback` function, while this code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Test notification");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not notify the promise with any value, while this code fragment would notify the promise with the string "Test notification".

DONE.
