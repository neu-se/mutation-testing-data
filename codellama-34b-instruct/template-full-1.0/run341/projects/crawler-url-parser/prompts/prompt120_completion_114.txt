  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello", baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"hello"` string would be treated as a URL, leading to a different outcome in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the `linkurl` parameter, leading to a different outcome in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the `pageurl` parameter, leading to a different outcome in the `gettype` function.

DONE.
