  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`) in the parsed URL object. By removing the protocol from the `embedBaseUrlStr` variable, the `URL.parse()` method will not be able to parse the URL correctly, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`) in the parsed URL object. By replacing the protocol with `http://`, the `URL.parse()` method will not be able to parse the URL correctly, leading to different behavior.
