  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` is a different method that takes a key, updater function, and a callback as parameters, whereas `set` only takes a key, value, and a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method that takes a key as a parameter and returns the corresponding value, whereas `set` stores a key-value pair in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` is a different method that takes a key and a callback as parameters, whereas `set` stores a key-value pair in the database.

DONE.
