  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setValue"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setValue" is not a valid method for a Promise object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a valid method for a Promise object, but it would not have the same behavior as "set" because it would return the value of the property, rather than setting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setProperty" is not a valid method for a Promise object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
