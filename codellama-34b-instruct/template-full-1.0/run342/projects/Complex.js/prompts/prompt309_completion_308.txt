  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the cosine function with the sine function, leading to a different calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the cosine function with the tangent function, leading to a different calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the cosine function with the secant function, leading to a different calculation.

DONE.
