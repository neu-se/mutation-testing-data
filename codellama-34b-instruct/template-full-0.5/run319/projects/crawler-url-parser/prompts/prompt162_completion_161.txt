  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 1, while the new code fragment checks for greater than 1. This change would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have more than one path part more than the page URL, rather than exactly one more part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 1, while the new code fragment checks for greater than or equal to 1. This change would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have at least one more path part than the page URL, rather than exactly one more part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length > pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the number of path parts in the link URL and
