  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is defined as `Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 1 - x : (<PLACEHOLDER>(x) + Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5`, which means that if `x` is small enough, `cosh` will return `1 - x`, while `Math.exp(x)` will return a value close to `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is defined as `Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 1 - x : (<PLACEHOLDER>(x) + Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5`, which means that if `x` is small enough, `cosh` will return `1 - x`, while `Math.exp(x) + 1` will return a value close
