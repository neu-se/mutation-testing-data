 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of an object's own enumerable property values, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of an object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of all own property names of an object, including non-enumerable properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns only the enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice(0)` creates a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of property names. This change would cause the function to always treat the input as an array, even if it is an object with numeric keys, potentially leading
