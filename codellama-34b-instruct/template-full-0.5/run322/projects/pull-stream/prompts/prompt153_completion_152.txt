  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `abort`, and it would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, undefined, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `abort`, and it would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with the same set of arguments as the original code, but with a different value for the `abort` parameter.

DONE.
