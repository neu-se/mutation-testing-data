  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.valueOf` is a function that returns the value of the `inspect` object, whereas `inspect` is an object that contains methods for inspecting the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.inspect` is a function that returns the value of the `inspect` object, whereas `inspect` is an object that contains methods for inspecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.promiseDispatch` is a function that dispatches the promise to the appropriate method, whereas `inspect` is an object that contains methods for inspecting the promise.

DONE.
