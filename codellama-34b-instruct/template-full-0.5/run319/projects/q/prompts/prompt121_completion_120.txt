  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `key in object` would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = object.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once, as the condition `key in object` would be true for the last index in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.floor(Math.random() * object.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute with a random index each time, as the condition `key in object` would be true for a random index in the array.

DONE.
