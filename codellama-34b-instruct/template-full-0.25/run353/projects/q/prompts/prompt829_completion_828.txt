  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, whereas this modified code fragment always throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, whereas this modified code fragment always throws an error.
