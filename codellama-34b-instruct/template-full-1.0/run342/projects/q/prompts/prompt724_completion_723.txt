  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would change the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, regardless of whether the input array contains only promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would change the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, regardless of whether the input array contains only promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){return 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would change the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, regardless of whether the input array contains only promises
