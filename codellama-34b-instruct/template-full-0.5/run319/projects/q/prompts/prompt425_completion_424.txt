  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on the object, potentially causing a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method immediately, rather than passing a reference to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with `this` as an argument, rather than calling the `inspect` method on the object.

DONE.
