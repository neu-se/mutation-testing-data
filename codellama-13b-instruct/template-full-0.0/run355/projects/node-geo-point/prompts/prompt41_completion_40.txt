  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2Rad` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `cos` function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is used instead of the `point1Rad` variable, which would result in a different calculation for the `r` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` constant is used instead of the `point1Rad` variable, which would result in a different calculation for the `r` variable.

DONE.
