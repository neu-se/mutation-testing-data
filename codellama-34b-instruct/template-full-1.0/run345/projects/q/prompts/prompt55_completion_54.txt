  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is coerced to the string `"null"` when passed to `toString()`, and the test suite may not be expecting this value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is coerced to the string `"undefined"` when passed to `toString()`, and the test suite may not be expecting this value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that is returned when an operation is performed with `null` or `undefined` operands, and the test suite may not be expecting this value.

DONE.
