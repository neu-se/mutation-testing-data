Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the message property of the reason object instead of the stack trace, which may not provide sufficient information about the error context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred: " + reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates a string with the reason, which may not include the stack trace and could lead to loss of important debugging information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the stack trace with `undefined`, which would not provide any information about the error, making it impossible to trace the source of the rejection.

DONE.
