  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the position of the `thisIter` iterator, which is not intended in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over one more element in the `otherIter` iterator than the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more element than the original code does.

DONE.
