  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    if (err) {
        nodeback(err);
    } else {
        nodeback(null, value);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeback` function to be called with an error object as the first argument, even if the promise resolves successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    if (err) {
        nodeback(err);
    } else {
        nodeback(value);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeback` function to be called with the resolved value as the first argument, even if the promise rejects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    if (err) {
        nodeback(err);
    } else {
        nodeback(null, value);
