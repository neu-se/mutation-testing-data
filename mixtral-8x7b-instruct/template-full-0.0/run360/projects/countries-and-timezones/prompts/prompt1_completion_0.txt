 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an empty string instead of falsy checks, which could cause the function to return null for valid inputs with empty strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof name === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact type of 'undefined' instead of a falsy check, which could cause the function to return null for valid inputs with undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly checks the input data instead of checking the name variable, which could cause the function to return null for valid inputs with missing country names.

DONE.
