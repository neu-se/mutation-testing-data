Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` attempts to convert a JSON string into an object, which is the opposite of what is intended here; it would lead to errors when trying to write data that is not in the correct format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${key}:${this._data.get(key)}`
```
This would result in different behavior because this format does not produce a valid JSON string, as it uses a colon instead of a comma to separate key-value pairs, which would cause issues when reading the data back.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify({key: this._data.get(key), val: null})
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `val` to `null` would change the intended data structure, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the data when it is read back, as it would imply that the value is intentionally absent rather than undefined.

DONE.
