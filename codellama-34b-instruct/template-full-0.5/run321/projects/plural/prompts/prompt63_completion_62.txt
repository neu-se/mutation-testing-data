  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "bacterium" specifically, while this new code fragment would check for "bacteria" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "bacterium" specifically, while this new code fragment would check for "bacterium" plus the letter "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'.repeat(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "bacterium" specifically, while this new code fragment would check for "bacterium" repeated twice.

DONE.
