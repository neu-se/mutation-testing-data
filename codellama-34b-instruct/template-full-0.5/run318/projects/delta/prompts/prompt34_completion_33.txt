  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a != null` is not the same as `typeof a !== 'object'`. The original code checks if `a` is not an object, while the new code checks if `a` is not null. This could cause the function to behave differently if `a` is a null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` is not the same as `typeof a !== 'object'`. The original code checks if `a` is not an object, while the new code checks if `a` is null. This could cause the function to behave differently if `a` is a null object.
