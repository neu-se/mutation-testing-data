  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^:]*:/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex fragment matches a string that starts with a protocol (e.g. "http://"), and the replacement fragment does not account for this.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!:\/\/)/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex fragment matches a string that starts with a protocol (e.g. "http://"), and the replacement fragment does not account for this.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!:\/\/|[^:]\/)/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex fragment matches a string that starts with a protocol (e.g. "http://"), and the replacement fragment does not account for this.

DONE.
