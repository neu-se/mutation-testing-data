  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.sink === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the check is made on the object itself, but in the mutated code, the check is made on the `sink` method of the object. If the object does not have a `sink` method, the mutated code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink && typeof s.sink === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the check is made on the object itself, but in the mutated code, the check is made on the `sink` method of the object. If the object does not have a `sink` method, the original code would not throw an error, but the mutated code would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code,
