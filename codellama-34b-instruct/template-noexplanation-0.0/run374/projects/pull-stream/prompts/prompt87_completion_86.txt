  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a non-null argument, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with an undefined argument, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null && cb !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a non-null and non-undefined argument, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
