  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function, while `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function. Using `fs.writeFileSync` would cause the code to block until the file is written, which could lead to performance issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` creates a new function that is bound to the `fs` object, which could cause issues if the function is called with a different `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(function(file, str, options) {
  return fs.writeFile(file, str, options);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function created by `univers
