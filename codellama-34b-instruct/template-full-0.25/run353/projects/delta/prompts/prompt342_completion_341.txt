  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOpData = baseOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `baseOp.insert` to `baseOpData`, rather than the value of `op.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOpData = op.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `op.retain` to `baseOpData`, rather than the value of `baseOp.insert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOpData = op.retain[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the first element of the `op.retain` array to `baseOpData`, rather than the value of `baseOp.insert`.

DONE.
