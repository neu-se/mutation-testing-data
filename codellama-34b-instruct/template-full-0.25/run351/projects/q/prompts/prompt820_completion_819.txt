  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument `1` is added to the `done` method, which would cause an error to be thrown if the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument `null` is added to the `done` method, which would cause the `fulfilled` callback to be called with a `null` value instead of the actual resolved value.

DONE.
