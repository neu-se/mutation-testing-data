 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/g, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of 'a' with 'e', while the original code only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/[aeiou]/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces any vowel with 'e', not just 'a'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/man$/i, 'women') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes 'man' to 'women' instead of applying the correct plural rule.

DONE.
