  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the task to the `head` object, rather than the `tail` object as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.task = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the task to the `tail` object, rather than the `head` object as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.next = tail;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `tail` object to the `next` property of the `head` object, rather than the `task` property as in the original code.

DONE.
