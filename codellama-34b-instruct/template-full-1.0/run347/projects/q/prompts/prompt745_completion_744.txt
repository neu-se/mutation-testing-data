  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is rejected, the `onRejected` function would be called instead of the `onFulfilled` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is fulfilled, the `onFulfilled` function would be called instead of the `onRejected` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is rejected or fulfilled, the `onFulfilled` function would not be called.

DONE.
