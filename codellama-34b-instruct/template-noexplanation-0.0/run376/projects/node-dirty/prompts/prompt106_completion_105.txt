  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This will cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to `undefined`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This will cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to one more than the original value, which may cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This will cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to twice the original value, which may cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
