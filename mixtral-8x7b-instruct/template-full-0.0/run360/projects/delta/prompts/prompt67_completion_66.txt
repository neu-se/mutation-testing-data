 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.length = this.ops.length + 1;
this.ops[this.ops.length - 1] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of inserting the newOp at the correct position, it will always be added at the end of the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the newOp will always be inserted at the beginning of the ops array, rather than at the correct position based on the conditions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops = [...this.ops, newOp];
```
This would result in different behavior because the newOp will always be added at the end of the ops array as a new element, rather than replacing or inserting into an existing element based on the conditions.

DONE.
