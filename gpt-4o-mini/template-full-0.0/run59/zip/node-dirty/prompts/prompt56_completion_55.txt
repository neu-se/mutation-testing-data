Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of closing the database file streams, it would simply emit a 'drain' event, potentially leading to unhandled writes remaining in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to end the write stream without checking if there are any in-flight writes or queued operations, which could lead to data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._waitForDrain = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `_waitForDrain` flag to true, preventing the 'drain' event from being emitted and potentially causing the application to hang if there are pending writes.

DONE.
