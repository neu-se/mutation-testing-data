  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the subsequent code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the subsequent code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in the subsequent code.

DONE.
