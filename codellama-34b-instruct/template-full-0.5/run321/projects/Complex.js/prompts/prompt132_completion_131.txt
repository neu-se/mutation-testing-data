  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite and `z` is zero. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` in more cases, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite or `z` is infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` in more cases, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() || this['isZero']()
