  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `x` is incremented by 1, which would cause the calculation of `λ2` to be off by 1 degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `y` is multiplied by 2, which would cause the calculation of `λ2` to be off by 2 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `λ2` uses the sine and cosine of `θ` and `φ2`, respectively, which would cause the resulting angle to be different if the values of `θ` and `φ2` are not identical.

DONE.
