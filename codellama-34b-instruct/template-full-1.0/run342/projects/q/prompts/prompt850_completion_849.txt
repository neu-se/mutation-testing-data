  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error || "object" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is not a string.

DONE.
