  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther.delete` would refer to the `delete` property of the `firstOther` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.retain - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` refers to the `Delta` object, and `retain` is not a property of the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops` refers to the `ops` property of the `other` object, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
