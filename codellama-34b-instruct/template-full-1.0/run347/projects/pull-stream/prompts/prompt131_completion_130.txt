  DONE. The options you provided were:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function() {
    i++;
    return i;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    i--;
    return i;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    return i;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value.
