  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.parse = parse;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `parse` function as a property of the `module.exports` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = { parse };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `parse` function as the only property of the `module.exports` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = parse;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `parse` function as the only property of the `module.exports` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
