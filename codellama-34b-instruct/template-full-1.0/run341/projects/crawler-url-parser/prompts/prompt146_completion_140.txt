  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\./index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the dot character (.) instead of the index character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character other than a dot, followed by a dot and any character other than a dot.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character other than a dot, followed by any character other than a dot, and then the dot.

DONE.
