  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op.retain = length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property of the `op` object to the `length` value, instead of comparing it to the `length` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op.retain = length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property of the `op` object to `length + 1`, which is not the same as the original `length` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op.retain = length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property of the `op` object to `length - 1`, which is not the same as the original `length` value.

DONE.
