  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues if the policy name is used in a case-sensitive context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the policy name, which could potentially cause issues if the policy name is used in a context where a specific length is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the policy name on spaces, and the `[0]` index would return the first element of the resulting array, which could potentially cause issues if the policy name is used in a context where a specific format is expected.

DONE.
