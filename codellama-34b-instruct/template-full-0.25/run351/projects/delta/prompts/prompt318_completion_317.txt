  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for null or undefined attributes, while this code fragment only checks for undefined attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for null or undefined attributes, while this code fragment only checks for null attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

DONE.
