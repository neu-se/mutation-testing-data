  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")[1].replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method on the `linkurl_path` string, while this code fragment uses the `replace` method on the second element of the array returned by `split`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")[0].replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method on the `linkurl_path` string, while this code fragment uses the `replace` method on the first element of the array returned by `split`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substr(1).replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method on the `linkurl_path` string, while this code fragment uses the `replace` method on a substring of `linkurl_path` starting from the
