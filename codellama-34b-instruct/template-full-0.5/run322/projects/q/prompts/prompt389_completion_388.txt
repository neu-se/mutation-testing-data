  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed to the `then` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `then` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value.

DONE.
