  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `nodeback` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to add `1` to the `nodeback` variable, which would result in a `TypeError` if `nodeback` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method would attempt to call the `nodeback` function with no arguments, which would result in a `TypeError` if `nodeback` is not a function.

DONE.
