  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` to calculate the value of `2 * a`, but replacing it with `2 * b` would calculate the value of `2 * b` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` to calculate the value of `2 * a`, but replacing it with `a + b` would calculate the value of `a + b` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` to calculate the value of `2 * a`, but replacing it with `a * b` would calculate the value of `a * b` instead.

DONE.
