 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from http to https, which might cause the URL to be considered invalid or a different resource to be loaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http:/'
