  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` argument, while this new code fragment always returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` argument, while this new code fragment always returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` argument, while this new code fragment returns the result of calling the `mapper` function with the `data` argument.

DONE.
