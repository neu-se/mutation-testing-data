  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `pull` function with a single argument, `read`, but this replacement code uses the `pull` function with five arguments, `read`, `ref[0]`, `ref[1]`, `ref[2]`, and `ref[3]`. This would cause the test suite to fail if the `pull` function is not called with the correct number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], arguments[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `pull` function with a single argument, `read`, but this replacement code uses the `pull` function with five arguments, `read`, `ref[0]`, `ref[1]`, `ref[2]`, and `arguments[0]`. This would cause the test suite to fail if
