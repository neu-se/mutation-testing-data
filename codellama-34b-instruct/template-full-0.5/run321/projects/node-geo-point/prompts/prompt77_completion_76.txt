  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be increased by 180 degrees, which would cause the resulting destination point to be on the opposite side of the Earth.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be doubled, which would cause the resulting destination point to be twice as far away from the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be decreased by 180 degrees, which would cause the resulting destination point to be on the opposite side of the Earth.

DONE.
