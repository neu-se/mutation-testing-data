  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the data to the console instead of returning it as part of the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_read` function with `null` and `data` instead of returning `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `null` and `data` instead of returning `data`.

DONE.
