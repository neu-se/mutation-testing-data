  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: 42 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value 42, regardless of the input key. In the original code, the value returned for each key would depend on the value of `tzs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, regardless of the input key. In the original code, the value returned for each key would depend on the value of `tzs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: !tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite value of what `tzs` contains for each key. In the original code, the value returned for each key would depend on the value of `tzs`.

DONE.
