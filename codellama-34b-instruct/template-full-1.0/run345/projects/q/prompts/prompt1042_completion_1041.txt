  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, while `ends.promise.get` is a function that returns the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.then` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the first promise, while `ends.promise.get` is a function that returns the resolved value of the first promise directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, while `ends.promise.get` is a function that returns the resolved value of the first promise directly.

DONE.
