  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method creates a new array by merging two or more arrays, while `push` method adds new items to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method creates a new array by merging two or more arrays, while `shift` method removes the first item of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method creates a new array by merging two or more arrays, while `pop` method removes the last item of an array.

DONE.
