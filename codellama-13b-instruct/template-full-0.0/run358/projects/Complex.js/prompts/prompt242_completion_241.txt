  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the complex exponent using the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the complex exponent using the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the complex exponent using the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just the real part.

DONE.
