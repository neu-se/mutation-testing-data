  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments, 2)` would return a new array containing the elements of the `arguments` object from the second index onwards, whereas `array_slice` would return a new array containing all the elements of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a new array containing the elements of the `arguments` object from the second index onwards, whereas `array_slice` would return a new array containing all the elements of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing the elements of the `arguments` object
