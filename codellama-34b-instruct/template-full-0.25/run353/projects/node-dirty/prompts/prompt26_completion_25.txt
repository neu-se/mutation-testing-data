  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this replacement code fragment passes `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this replacement code fragment passes a new `Error` object with the message "dummy error".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this replacement code fragment passes `undefined` instead.

DONE.
