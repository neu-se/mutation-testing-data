  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator in the original code, so the expression would be evaluated as `(a * b) + c` instead of `a + (b + c)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator in the original code, so the expression would be evaluated as `a + (b * c)` instead of `(a + b) * c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator has the same precedence as the addition operator in the original code, so the expression would be evaluated as `a + (b - c)` instead of `a + (b + c)`.

DONE.
