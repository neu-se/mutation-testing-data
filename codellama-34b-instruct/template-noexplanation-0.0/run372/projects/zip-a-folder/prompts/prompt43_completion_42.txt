  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '*'
```
This code fragment will cause the glob pattern to match all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '?'
```
This code fragment will cause the glob pattern to match all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, but only if the file name contains at least one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '**'
```
This code fragment will cause the glob pattern to match all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, including files in subdirectories of subdirectories.

DONE.
