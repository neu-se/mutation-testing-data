  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.size && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!this._queue.size) && this._waitForDrain`, which would have the opposite effect of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `this._queue.size && (!this._waitForDrain)`, which would have the opposite effect of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be
