  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would only match words that end with "thesis", whereas the original rule would match any word that ends with "thesis" or "crisis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis$|crisis$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match any word that ends with "thesis" or "crisis", whereas the original rule would only match words that end with "thesis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis$|crisis$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'
