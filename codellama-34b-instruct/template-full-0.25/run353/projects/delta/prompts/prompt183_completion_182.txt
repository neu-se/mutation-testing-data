  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different property than `otherOp.retain`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when composing the two operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` is a different property than `otherOp.retain`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when composing the two operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different property than `otherOp.retain`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when composing the two operations.

DONE.
