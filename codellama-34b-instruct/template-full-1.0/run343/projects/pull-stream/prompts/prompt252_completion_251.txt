  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `_read` is `undefined`, which would never be the case in the original code, so it would always call `nextChunk()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `_read` is not `undefined`, which would never be the case in the original code, so it would always call `nextStream()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read.abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `_read` has an `abort` property, which it does not have in the original code, so it would always call `nextChunk()`.

DONE.
