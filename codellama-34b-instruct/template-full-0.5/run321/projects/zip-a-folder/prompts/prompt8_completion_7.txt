  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath == src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for equality instead of identity, which could cause the error message to be thrown even when the source and target folders are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath != src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality instead of identity, which could cause the error message to be thrown even when the source and target folders are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the target folder path includes the source folder path, which could cause the error message to be thrown even when the source and target folders are different.

DONE.
