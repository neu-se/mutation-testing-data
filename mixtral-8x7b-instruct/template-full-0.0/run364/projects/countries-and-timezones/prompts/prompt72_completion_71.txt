 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data.timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `data.timezones` object instead of using the `memoizeTimezone` function, which may lead to missing memoization and performance issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => buildTimezone({})
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new empty object for building the timezone, instead of using the correct data and name arguments, which could lead to incorrect timezone information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data, name) => { timezones[name] = buildTimezone(data, name); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the timezone object to the `timezones` object, bypassing the memoization mechanism. This could lead to incorrect timezone information when the same name is used multiple times.
