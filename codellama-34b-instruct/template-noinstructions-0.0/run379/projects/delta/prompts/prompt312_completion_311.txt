  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not being used, and the `{}` object is not being passed as the second argument to the `predicate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `predicate` function to be called with the wrong index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `predicate` function to be called with the wrong index.

DONE.
