  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas `!=` checks for non-strict inequality. This means that in the original code, the check would only pass if `prop` was not undefined and `match[index + 1]` was also not undefined. In the mutated code, the check would pass if `prop` was not undefined, regardless of the value of `match[index + 1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for non-strict inequality, whereas `===` checks for strict equality. This means that in the original code, the check would only pass if `prop` was undefined and `match[index + 1]` was also not undefined. In the mutated code, the check would pass if `prop` was undefined, regardless of the value
