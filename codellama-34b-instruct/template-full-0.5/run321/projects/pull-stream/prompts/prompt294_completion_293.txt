  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would always be called, whereas the modified code fragment would only call `cb` if `last` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would always be called, whereas the modified code fragment would only call `terminate` if `last` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would always be called with `null` as the first argument, whereas the modified code fragment would call `cb` with `ended` as the first argument if `last` is `false`.

DONE.
