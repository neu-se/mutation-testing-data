  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude are swapped, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine of the latitude is used instead of the latitude itself, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine of the longitude is used instead of the longitude itself, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
