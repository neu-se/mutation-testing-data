  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the starting point instead of the ending point, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the ending point instead of the latitude, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the latitude of the ending point, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
