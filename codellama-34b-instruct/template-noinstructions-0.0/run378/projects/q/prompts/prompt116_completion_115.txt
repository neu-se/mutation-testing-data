  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code fragment would access the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code fragment would access the previous element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code fragment would access the element at twice the index.

DONE.
