  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.filter(function (data) { return !test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the filter function twice, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.filter(function (data) { return test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the filter function in the opposite direction, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.filter(function (data) { return data !== test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the data to the result of the filter function, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
