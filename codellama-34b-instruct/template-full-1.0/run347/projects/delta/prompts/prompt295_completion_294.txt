  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.delete()` would remove the current element from the list, whereas `iter.next()` would return the next element in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` would return the next element in the list, whereas `iter.next()` would return the current element and move the iterator to the next position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.rewind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.rewind()` would move the iterator back to the start of the list, whereas `iter.next()` would move the iterator forward to the next position.

DONE.
