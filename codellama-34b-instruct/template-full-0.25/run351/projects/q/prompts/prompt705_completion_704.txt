  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a different variable than `arguments`, and it may not contain the same values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first argument from the `arguments` object, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `arguments` object to an array and remove the first element, which may not be intended.

DONE.
