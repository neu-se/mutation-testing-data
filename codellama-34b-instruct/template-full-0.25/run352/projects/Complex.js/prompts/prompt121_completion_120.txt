  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is infinite, while this replacement checks if it is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is infinite, while this replacement checks if it is not a number (NaN).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is infinite, while this replacement checks if it is zero.

DONE.
