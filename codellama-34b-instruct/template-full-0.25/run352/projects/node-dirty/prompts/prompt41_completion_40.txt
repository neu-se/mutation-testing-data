  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` is a different variable than `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 1 to the key, which would change the behavior of the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the path of the file as the key, which would change the behavior of the `get` method.

DONE.
