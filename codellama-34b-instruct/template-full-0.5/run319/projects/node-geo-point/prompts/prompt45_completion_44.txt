  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 0 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r > 1, but the modified code fragment would return 0 if r < 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r > 1, but the modified code fragment would return 2 if r > 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r > 1, but the modified code fragment would return 0 if r > 1.

DONE.
