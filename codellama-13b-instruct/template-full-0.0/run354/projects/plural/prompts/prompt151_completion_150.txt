  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in the context of the `plural` function, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `String` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method returns the primitive value of the object, whereas the original code fragment returns the string representation of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.toLocaleString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLocaleString` method returns a string representing the object in a locale-specific way, whereas the original code fragment returns the string representation of the object.

DONE.
