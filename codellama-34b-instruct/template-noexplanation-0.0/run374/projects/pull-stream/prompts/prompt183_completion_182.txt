  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This change will cause the function to return `true` for all indices greater than the length of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This change will cause the function to return `true` for all indices less than the length of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === array.length
```
This change will cause the function to return `true` for all indices that are equal to the length of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
