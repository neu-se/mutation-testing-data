  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
&&
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `|` operator, so the expression would be evaluated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
||
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `|` operator, so the expression would be evaluated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a different meaning than the `|` operator, so the expression would be evaluated differently.

DONE.
