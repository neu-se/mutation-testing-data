  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promises` array would not be modified by the `when` function, leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(array_map(promises, Q));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would not be called, leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(array_map(promises, Q).concat([deferred.promise]));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would not be called, leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
