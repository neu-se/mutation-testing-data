Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, checking if the old string has a newline at the end and there are no newlines before adds, instead of checking if it doesn't have a newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newEOFNewline &&!noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks a different condition, looking at the new string's newline status and the absence of newlines before adds, which would trigger the special case in a different scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline || noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from "and" to "or", making the condition more permissive and potentially triggering the special case more often than the original code.

DONE.
