  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a && 'im' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the properties in the object is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a && 'im' in a && 'abs' in a && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional properties in the object are checked for existence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a && 'im' in a && 'r' in a && 'phi' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional properties in the object are checked for existence.

DONE.
