  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the code to resolve the promise with the exception, rather than rejecting it as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
os.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit immediately, rather than continuing to execute as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
os.abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to terminate immediately, without running any pending tasks or flushing any open streams, rather than continuing to execute as in the original code.

DONE.
