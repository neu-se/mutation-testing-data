  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to decode the basename, while this replacement uses the `toLowerCase` method to convert the basename to lowercase. This could cause the test to fail if the test is expecting the basename to be decoded, but not to be converted to lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.basename` function to get the basename of the path, while this replacement uses the `toUpperCase` method to convert the basename to uppercase. This could cause the test to fail if the test is expecting the basename to be in a specific case, but not to be converted to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(pathname)
```
