  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.longitude) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `point2Rad` variable to be off by 1 degree, which could result in a significant difference in the calculated distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.longitude) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `point2Rad` variable to be twice as large as it should be, which could result in a significant difference in the calculated distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.longitude) - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `point2Rad` variable to be off by 1 degree in the opposite direction, which could result in a
