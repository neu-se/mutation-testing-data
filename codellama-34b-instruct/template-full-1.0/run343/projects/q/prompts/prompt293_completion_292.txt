  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a defined method on the `deferred` object, leading to a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for the `resolve` method, leading to a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a defined method on the `deferred` object, leading to a runtime error.

DONE.
