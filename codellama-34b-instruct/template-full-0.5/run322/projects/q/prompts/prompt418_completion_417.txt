  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the state to be "pending", but this change would check for the state to be "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the state to be "pending", but this change would check for the state to be "fulfilled".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the state to be "pending", but this change would check for the state to be "pending".

DONE.
