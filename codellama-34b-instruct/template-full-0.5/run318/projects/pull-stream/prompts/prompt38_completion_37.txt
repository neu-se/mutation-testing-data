  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `pull` function, which could cause a different execution path to be taken.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `pull` function, which could cause a different execution path to be taken.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the same argument to the `pull` function twice, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
