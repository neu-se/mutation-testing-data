  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause errors in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] * 2, temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number, which could cause errors in the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + x['im'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause errors in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
