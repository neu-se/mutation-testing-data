 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the `undefined` value, while the original code checks for the existence of the `resolvedPromise` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolvedPromise === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the `resolvedPromise` property of the current object with the value of `undefined`, while the original code checks for the existence of the `resolvedPromise` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the falsy value of the `resolvedPromise` property of the current object, while the original code checks for the existence of the `resolvedPromise` variable.

DONE.
