  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = a + b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` would be assigned the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than the original code where `c` is assigned the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = a - b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` would be assigned the difference of `a` and `b`, rather than the original code where `c` is assigned the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = a * b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` would be assigned the product of `a` and `b`, which is the original behavior of the code. However, this option is not a valid mutation because it does not change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
