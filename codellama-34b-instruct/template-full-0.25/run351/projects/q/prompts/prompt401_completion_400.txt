  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.catch` is a different method than `this.then`, and it would not be called in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.finally` is a different method than `this.then`, and it would not be called in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.then` is a different method than `this.then`, and it would not be called in the same way.

DONE.
