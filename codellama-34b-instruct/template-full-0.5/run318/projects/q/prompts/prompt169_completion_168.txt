  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the function is called with an internal frame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the function is called with an external frame.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame == false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the function is called with an internal frame.

DONE.
