  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the radian values of the two points, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * point2Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the product of the radian values of the two points, which could change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
