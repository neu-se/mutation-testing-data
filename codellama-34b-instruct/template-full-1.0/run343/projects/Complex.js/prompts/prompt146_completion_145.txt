  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      if ((this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero'](zee) && z['isInfinite']())) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the divisor is zero, which is not the same as checking if the exponent is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      if ((this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero'](a) && z['isInfinite']())) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the base is zero, which is not the same as checking if the exponent is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      if ((this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero'](a)) || (this['isZero'](a) && z['isInfinite']())) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the
