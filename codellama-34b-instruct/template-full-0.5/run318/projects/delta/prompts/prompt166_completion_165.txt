  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return `null` instead of `'delete'`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return `null` instead of `'insert'`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return `'retain'` instead of `'delete'`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
