  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `-1` to find the last character of the string, while `0` would find the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(str.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `-1` to find the last character of the string, while `Math.floor(str.length / 2)` would find the middle character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `-1` to find the last character of the string, while `str.length * 2` would find a character that is twice the length of the string.

DONE.
