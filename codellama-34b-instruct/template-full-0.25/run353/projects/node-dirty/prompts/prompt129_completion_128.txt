  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called with a boolean argument, which would cause the stream to be corked or uncorked, regardless of the value of `this._waitForDrain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._waitForDrain);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called with a boolean argument that is the opposite of the value of `this._waitForDrain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called with a boolean argument that is the size of the queue, which would cause the stream to be corked or uncorked based on the size of the queue, regardless of the value of `this._wait
