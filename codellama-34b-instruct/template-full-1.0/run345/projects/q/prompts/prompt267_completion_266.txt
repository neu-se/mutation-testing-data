  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a different function from `become`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` is a different function from `become`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `Qnotify` is a different function from `become`.

DONE.
