  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the coordinates array, while the original code fragment considers both elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second element of the coordinates array, while the original code fragment considers both elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the length of the coordinates array, while the original code fragment considers the actual values of the array.

DONE.
