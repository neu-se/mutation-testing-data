  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block and execute the `bootstrap` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block and execute the `bootstrap` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block and execute the `bootstrap` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
