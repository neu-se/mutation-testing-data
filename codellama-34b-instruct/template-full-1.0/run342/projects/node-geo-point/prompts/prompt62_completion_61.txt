  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
racos
```
This would result in different behavior because `racos` is not a valid trigonometric function, while `cos` is. Using `racos` would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return incorrect values, leading to errors in the program's computation.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method performs division by `sin(φ1)`. If `sin(φ1)` is zero, division by zero would cause the program to throw a runtime error. By replacing `sin(φ1)` with `1`, the program would try to divide by `1`, which would return a value but would still cause the program's computation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method calculates the bearing between two points using trigon
