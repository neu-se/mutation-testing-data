  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` inside the `makeNodeResolver` function, which would be bound to the `deferred` object. However, by using `call` with `void 0`, the `this` inside `makeNodeResolver` would refer to the global object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver && deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `makeNodeResolver` unconditionally, whereas the new code fragment only calls it if `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(null, arguments);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `makeNodeResolver` with a fixed
