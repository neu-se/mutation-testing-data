  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would always return the `id` function, regardless of whether `mapper` is truthy or falsy, whereas the original code fragment would only return `id` if `mapper` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper && mapper.isNotAProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would only return `id` if `mapper` is truthy and has the property `isNotAProperty`, whereas the original code fragment would only return `id` if `mapper` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would only return the `id` function if `read` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would only return `id` if `mapper` is falsy.

DONE
