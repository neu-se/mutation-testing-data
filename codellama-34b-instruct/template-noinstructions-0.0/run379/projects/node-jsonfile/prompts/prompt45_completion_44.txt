  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed two arguments to `stringify`, but this modified code fragment passes three arguments. This could cause the `stringify` function to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different output file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed two arguments to `stringify`, but this modified code fragment passes three arguments, with the third argument being an empty object. This could cause the `stringify` function to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different output file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed two arguments to `stringify`, but this modified code fragment passes three arguments, with the third argument being `undefined`. This could cause the `stringify` function to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different output file.

DONE.
