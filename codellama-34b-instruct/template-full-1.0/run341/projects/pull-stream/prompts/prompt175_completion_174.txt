  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `array` variable to a different value than the original code fragment, which is `Object.keys(array)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different method than the original code fragment, which is `Object.keys(array)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random value instead of using the keys of the `array` object.

DONE.
