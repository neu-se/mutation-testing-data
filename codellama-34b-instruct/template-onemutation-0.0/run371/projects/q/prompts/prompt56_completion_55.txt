  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that expects to be called with `process` as its context, but `bind(null)` will change the context to `null`. This could cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
