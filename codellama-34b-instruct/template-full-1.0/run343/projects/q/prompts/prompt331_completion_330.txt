  Mutation testing is a process of perturbing some aspect of a program in order to check whether test cases could detect such a change. In the context of your code, three options for the mutation are presented.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(inspect && inspect.state === "pending")
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the original condition with an additional check for the inspection state. Thus, if the inspection state is not "pending" and the statement inside the parentheses evaluates to false, the resulting code differs from its equivalent in the un-perturbed version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(inspect && inspect.state !== "rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the original condition with an additional check for the inspection state. Thus, if the inspection state is "rejected" and the statement inside the parentheses evaluates to false, the resulting code differs from its equivalent in the un-perturbed version.

Option 3: The PLACE
