  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is zero, while this replacement checks if it is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the real part is zero, while this replacement checks if it is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is less than or equal to zero, while this replacement checks if it is greater than zero.

DONE.
