  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(other.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the entire `other` delta with the `delta` object, instead of just the first operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(other.ops[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the second operation of the `other` delta with the `delta` object, instead of just the first operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(other.ops[2]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the third operation of the `other` delta with the `delta` object, instead of just the first operation.

DONE.
