  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` expects a callback function, passing `false` would cause the callback to be ignored, and the data would remain in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` expects a callback function, passing an empty function would cause the callback to be called immediately, without deleting the data from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, cb) => Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this._data[key]).indexOf(cb) === -1 ? cb : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` expects a callback function, passing a function that checks if the callback is already present in the object's properties would cause the callback to be called only once, even if it is called multiple times.

DONE.
