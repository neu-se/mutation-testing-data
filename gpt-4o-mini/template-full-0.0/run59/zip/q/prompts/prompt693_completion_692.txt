Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the arguments to the `apply` method, causing the function to be called without any arguments instead of the intended ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the arguments to the `apply` method, which is not a valid argument list and would likely lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the invoked function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty string as the arguments to the `apply` method, which would not match the expected argument structure and could lead to incorrect function execution or errors.

DONE.
