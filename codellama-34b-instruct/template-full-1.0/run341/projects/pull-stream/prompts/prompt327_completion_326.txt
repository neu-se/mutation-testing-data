  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end => end === 'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `end` as a boolean value, while the replaced code fragment checks for `end` as a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end => !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `end` as a boolean value, while the replaced code fragment checks for `end` as a negated boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end => end && cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb(end, data)` when `end` is not `null`, while the replaced code fragment calls `cb(end, data)` when `end` is not falsy.

DONE.
