  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` is being called with the wrong arguments. In the original code, the callback is called with `end` and `data`, but in the mutated code, it is called with `end` and `cb`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` is being called with `null` instead of `data`. This would likely cause the callback to fail or return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` is being called with `undefined` instead of `data`. This would likely cause the callback to fail or return incorrect results.

DONE.
