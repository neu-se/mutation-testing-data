  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a number, but this option checks for a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code explicitly checks for the number value, but this option checks for any non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a number, but this option checks for the string value 'foo'.

DONE.
