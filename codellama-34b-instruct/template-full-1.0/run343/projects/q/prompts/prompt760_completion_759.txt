  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because array_filter returns only the elements of an array for which the filter function returns true, whereas array_map returns a new array based on the transformed value of each element in the old array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because array_reduce applies an operation on each element of an array and returns a single output value, whereas array_map returns a new array based on the transformed value of each element in the old array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because array_indexOf returns the first index of an element in an array, whereas array_map returns a new array based on the transformed value of each element in the old array.

DONE.
