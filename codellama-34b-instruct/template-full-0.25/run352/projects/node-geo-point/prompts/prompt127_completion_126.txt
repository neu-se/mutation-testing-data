  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `point` argument is truthy, but `null` is falsy, so the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `point` argument is truthy, but `undefined` is falsy, so the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `point` argument is truthy, but `0` is falsy, so the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed.

DONE.
