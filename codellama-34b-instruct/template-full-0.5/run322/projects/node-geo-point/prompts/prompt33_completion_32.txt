  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the second point instead of the first point, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value of the first point instead of the longitude value, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value of the second point instead of the longitude value, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
