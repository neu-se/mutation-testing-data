  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `typeof b !== 'object'` and `b === null`, while this new code fragment only checks for `typeof b !== 'object'`. This means that if `b` is `null`, the original code would execute the `throw` statement, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `typeof b !== 'object'` and `b === null`, while this new code fragment only checks for `b !== null`. This means that if `b` is an object, the original code would execute the `throw` statement, while this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `typeof b !== 'object'` and
