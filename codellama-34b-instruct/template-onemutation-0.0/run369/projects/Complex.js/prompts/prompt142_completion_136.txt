  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero and `this` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is zero and `this` is zero. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` when `z` is zero and `this` is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
