  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `resolve` variable, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `false` if `resolve` is truthy, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `resolve` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if `resolve` is falsy, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolve` is `false`.

DONE.
