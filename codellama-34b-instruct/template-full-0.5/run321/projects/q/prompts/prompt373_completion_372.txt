  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `Q.onerror` function from being called, which could cause the error to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` function with an empty function, which would not handle the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Unhandled error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` function with a function that throws an error, which would cause the program to crash.

DONE.
