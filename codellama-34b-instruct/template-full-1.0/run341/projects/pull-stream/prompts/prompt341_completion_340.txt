  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator flips the boolean value of the expression, so `!seen[key]` would return `true` if `seen[key]` is `false`, and `false` if `seen[key]` is `true`. In the original code, `seen[key]` is always set to `true`, so the `!` operator would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so `seen[key] === 1` would only return `true` if `seen[key]` is strictly equal to `1`. In the original code, `seen[key]` is always set to `true`, which is not strictly equal to `1`, so the `===` operator would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
