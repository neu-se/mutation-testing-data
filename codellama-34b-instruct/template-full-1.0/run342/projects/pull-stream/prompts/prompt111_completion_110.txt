  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a reference to an object, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a reference to an object, while `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a reference to an object, while `{}` is an empty object.

DONE.
