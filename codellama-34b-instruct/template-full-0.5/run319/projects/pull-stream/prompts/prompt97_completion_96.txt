  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which inverts the truthiness of the `ended` variable. In the original code, the `ended` variable is only set to `true` when the `cb` function is called, so if `ended` is `true`, it means that the `cb` function has already been called. By inverting the truthiness of `ended` using `!`, we are essentially checking if the `cb` function has not been called yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended === true` is a strict equality check, which checks if the `ended` variable is strictly equal to `true`. In the original code, the `ended` variable is only set to `true` when the `cb` function is called, so if `ended` is `true`, it means that the `cb` function has already been called. By using `===` instead of `!
