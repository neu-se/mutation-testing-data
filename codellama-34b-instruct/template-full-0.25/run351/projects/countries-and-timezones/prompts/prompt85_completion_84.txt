  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is truthy or falsy. In the original code, the `options` object is only used to determine whether to include deprecated timezones in the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if the `deprecated` property of the `options` object is truthy, rather than the original `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `deprecated` property of the `options` object if it is truthy, rather than the original `options` object.

DONE.
