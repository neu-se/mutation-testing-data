 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * deg2rad(point2.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the calculation result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(point2.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the wrong function, using the `Math.cos` function instead of `deg2rad`. This would lead to incorrectly calculated radians for the `point2.latitude` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deg2rad(Math.abs(point2.latitude));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.abs` function to get the absolute value of `point2.latitude` before passing it to `deg2rad`. This would cause incorrect radian values for negative latitude inputs, affecting the calculation of distances and bearings.

DONE.
