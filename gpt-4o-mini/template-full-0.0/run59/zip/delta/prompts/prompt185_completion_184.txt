Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly handle cases where `otherOp.retain` is a number, leading to potential logic errors in the composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check for null values only, ignoring the case where `otherOp.retain` is defined but not a number, which could lead to incorrect operation handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the condition to pass if `otherOp.retain` is strictly `true`, which is not the intended logic and would cause valid retain operations to be skipped.

DONE.
