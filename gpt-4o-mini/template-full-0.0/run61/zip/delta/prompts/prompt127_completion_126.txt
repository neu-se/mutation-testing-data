Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always retrieve only one operation, potentially skipping over multiple operations that should be processed in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next` with `0` would not advance the iterator at all, leading to an infinite loop or failure to retrieve any operations when the slice is expected to include elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `peek` instead of `next` would not advance the iterator, causing the same operation to be processed repeatedly without moving forward in the operations list.

DONE.
