 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `test` property of the `data` object, whereas the original code simply passes the `data` to the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
