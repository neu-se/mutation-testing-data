  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function would receive `null` as the `options` argument, which would cause it to use the default options instead of the user-provided ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, { encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function would receive an `encoding` option with a value of `'utf8'`, which would cause it to read the file as a UTF-8 encoded string instead of the default encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, { throws: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` function would receive a `throws` option with a value of `false`, which would cause it to suppress any errors that occur during the reading of the file, instead of throwing them.

DONE.
