  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would not be called with a callback function, and therefore would not be able to fulfill the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called with a null callback function, and therefore would not be able to fulfill the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called with an empty callback function, and therefore would not be able to fulfill the promise.

DONE.
