  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy([Error])
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` immediately destroys the stream, whereas `end()` gracefully closes the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy([Error])
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` immediately destroys the stream, whereas `end()` gracefully closes the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` pauses buffering data for the stream, whereas `end()` gracefully closes the stream.

DONE.
