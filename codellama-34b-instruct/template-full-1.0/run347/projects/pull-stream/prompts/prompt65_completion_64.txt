  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with an error object as the first argument, but using `null` would cause the callback to be invoked without any arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors further down the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with an error object as the first argument, but using `undefined` would cause the callback to be invoked without any arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors further down the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with an error object as the first argument, but using `0` would cause the callback to be invoked with a falsy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors further down the line.

DONE.
