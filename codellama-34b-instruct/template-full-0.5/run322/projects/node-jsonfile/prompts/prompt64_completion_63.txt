  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf-16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string encoding would be different, causing the resulting string to be different than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string encoding would be different, causing the resulting string to be different than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string encoding would be different, causing the resulting string to be different than the original.

DONE.
