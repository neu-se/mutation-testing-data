  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when the `end` argument is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, i--
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` instead of `null` when the `end` argument is falsy, and it will also decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i, i++
```
This change will cause the function to return the current value of `i` instead of `null` when the `end` argument is falsy, and it will also increment the `i` variable.

DONE.
