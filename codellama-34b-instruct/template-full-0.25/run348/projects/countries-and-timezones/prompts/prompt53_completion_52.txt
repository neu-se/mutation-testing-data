  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, whereas the original code would only return non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only non-deprecated timezones, whereas the original code would return all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only non-deprecated timezones, whereas the original code would return all timezones.

DONE.
