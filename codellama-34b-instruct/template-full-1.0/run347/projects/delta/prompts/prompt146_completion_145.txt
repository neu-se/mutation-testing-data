  Sure, here are three potential options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code you provided:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.skip()
```
This would result in different behavior because `skip` will skip over the current element in the iterator, whereas `next` would return the current element and move the iterator to the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is the iterator for the `other` delta, which may have a different number of elements than the `this` delta. If `otherIter.next()` is called when `otherIter` is not at the end of the delta, it will return a different element than what `thisIter.next()` would return.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` will return the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, whereas `next`
