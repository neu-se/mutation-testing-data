  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy of the input object, whereas `null` would simply return a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy of the input object, whereas `undefined` would simply return an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy of the input object, whereas `{}` would simply return an empty object.

DONE.
