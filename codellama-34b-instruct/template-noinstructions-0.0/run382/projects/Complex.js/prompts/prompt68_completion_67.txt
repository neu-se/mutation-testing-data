  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `parser_exit` function, while this replacement would cause the function to be called, potentially exiting the parser prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid argument');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, while this replacement would cause an error to be thrown, potentially causing the parser to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return `Complex['INFINITY']`, while this replacement would cause the function to return this value, potentially causing the parser to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
