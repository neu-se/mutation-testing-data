  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename.split('.')[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `basename` returns the full file name with extension, while the new code fragment `basename.split('.')[0]` returns the file name without extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(path.basename(pathname))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `basename` returns the full file name with extension, while the new code fragment `path.basename(pathname)` returns the file name without extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname.split('/').pop())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `basename` returns the full file name with extension, while the new code fragment `pathname.split('/').pop()` returns the file name without extension.

DONE.
