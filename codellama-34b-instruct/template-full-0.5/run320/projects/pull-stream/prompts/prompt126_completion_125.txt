  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator checks for greater than or equal to, whereas the original `>` operator checks for strictly greater than. This change would cause the function to return a different result for inputs that are equal to `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks for strictly less than, whereas the original `>` operator checks for strictly greater than. This change would cause the function to return a different result for inputs that are less than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, whereas the original `>` operator checks for strict inequality. This change would cause the function to return a different result for inputs that are equal to `max`.

DONE.
