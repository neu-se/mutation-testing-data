  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
've'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'ve'` is a different string than `'ves'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'s'` is a different string than `'ves'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different concatenation than `'ves'`.

DONE.
