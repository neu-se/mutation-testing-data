  To apply mutation testing to the code and find potential bugs, we need to introduce changes into the code that deviate from the original intent. Here are three options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` with different code fragments that could result in different behavior:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```js
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds it down. This change could cause incorrect distance calculations and lead to wrong tile locations.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```js
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, which could lead to unpredictable and incorrect calculations. This change could cause incorrect tile locations and distances.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```js
Math.pow(2, zoom) - x
```
This would result in different behavior because it in
