  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would slice the array from index `-1`, which is an invalid index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would slice the array from index `undefined`, which is considered "falsy" and would be treated as equivalent to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would slice the array from index `null`, which is considered "falsy" and would be treated as equivalent to `0`.

DONE.
