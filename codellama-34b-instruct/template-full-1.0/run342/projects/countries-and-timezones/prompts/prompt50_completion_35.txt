  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.timezones).forEach(memoizeTimezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the object, whereas `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys of the object. This means that if the values of the `data.timezones` object are not objects, but rather primitive values such as strings or numbers, the `Object.values()` method would return an array of those values, whereas `Object.keys()` would return an array of the keys of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let timezone in data.timezones) {
  memoizeTimezone(timezone);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `for...in` loops iterate over the properties of an object, whereas `Object.keys()` iterates over the keys of an object. This means that if the `data.timezones` object has any properties that are not keys, the `for...in
