  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array instead of an array of countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with the name "timezone" instead of the actual timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of countries that are not associated with the correct timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"country"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with the name "country" instead of the actual timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of countries that are not associated with the correct timezone.

DONE.
