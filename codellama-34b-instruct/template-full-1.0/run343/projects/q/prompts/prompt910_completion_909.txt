  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseArgs` array to include an additional argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs` array to include an additional argument at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[], 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseArgs` array to be empty and the `nodeArgs` array to include an additional argument at the beginning.

DONE.
