  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `this` is infinite, but not `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is infinite, but not if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite, but not if `this` is infinite and `z` is infinite.

DONE.
