  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if `op.retain` is equal to the string `'number'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if `op.retain` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if `op.retain` is equal to null.

DONE.
