Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a slash to the filename, potentially changing the path that is being used to open the file, which could lead to errors if the file does not exist at that location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character from the filename, potentially changing the path that is being used to open the file, which could lead to errors if the file does not exist at that location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.root.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the path of the root directory instead of the provided filename, potentially changing the location where the file is being opened, which could lead to errors if the file does not exist at that location.

DONE.
