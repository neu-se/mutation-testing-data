  Option 1: Replace `void 0` with `undefined` as follows:

```
return fulfilled.apply(undefined, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a shorter alternative to `undefined`, but it is not immediately clear to readers what it means.

Option 2: Replace `void 0` with `null` as follows:

```
return fulfilled.apply(null, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different object than `undefined`, and it may cause errors or unexpected behavior in some cases.

Option 3: Replace `void 0` with `this.abc` as follows:

```
return fulfilled.apply(this.abc, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.abc` is a property that may not exist, and it may cause errors or unexpected behavior in some cases.

DONE.
