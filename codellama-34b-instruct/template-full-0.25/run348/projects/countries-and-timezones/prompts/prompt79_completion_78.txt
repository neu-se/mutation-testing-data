  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter, which would return a timezone object, but the original code fragment was calling the `getTimezone` function without any parameters, which would return all timezone objects.

```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` and `options` parameters, which would return a timezone object with the specified options, but the original code fragment was calling the `getTimezone` function with only the `name` parameter, which would return all timezone objects without any options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter and an options object with the `
