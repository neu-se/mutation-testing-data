  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `hasNext()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` property is being accessed instead of the `hasNext()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is being called instead of the `hasNext()` method.

DONE.
