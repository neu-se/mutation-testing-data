  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the inner function `getTimezone` would not be called, and the outer function would return `null` instead of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the inner function `getTimezone` would not be called, and the outer function would return `undefined` instead of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the inner function `getTimezone` would not be called, and the outer function would return an empty object `{}` instead of an object.

DONE.
