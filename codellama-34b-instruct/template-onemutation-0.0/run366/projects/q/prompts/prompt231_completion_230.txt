  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `push` adds a new element to the end of the array. In this case, using `pop` would cause the progress listener to be removed from the array, which would prevent it from being called when the promise is resolved.
