  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `embedBaseUrlStr` to the `parse` function as the `baseUrlStr` parameter, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `embedBaseUrlStr` to the `parse` function as the `currentUrlStr` parameter, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(null, embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `currentUrlStr` parameter and the `embedBaseUrlStr` as the `baseUrlStr` parameter, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
