  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the latitude of the point in radians. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the calculation to use the wrong latitude value, leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ2)` is a different function of the latitude value, and would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ2)` is a different function of the latitude value, and would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
