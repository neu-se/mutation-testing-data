  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time, potentially leading to a missed iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times, potentially leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
