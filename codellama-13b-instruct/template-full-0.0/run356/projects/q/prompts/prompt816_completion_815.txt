  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done(void 0, void 0, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is called with no arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, regardless of whether the original promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is called with a function argument, which would cause the function to be called when the promise is settled, regardless of whether the original promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done(function (value) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is called with a function argument that takes a value argument, which would cause the function to be called with the value of the original promise when it is fulfilled, and would cause the promise to be rejected if the original promise
