  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `reverse` method, which would return a reversed version of the array, rather than a slice of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `concat` method, which would concatenate the array with the value `1`, rather than returning a slice of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x > 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `filter` method, which would return a new array containing only the elements that pass the filter function, rather than returning a slice of the array.

DONE.
