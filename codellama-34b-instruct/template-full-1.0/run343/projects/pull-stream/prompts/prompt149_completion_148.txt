  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `Object.keys()` would return an empty array when called on `null`, whereas `object` is a truthy value, and `Object.keys()` would return an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `Object.keys()` would throw a `TypeError` when called on `undefined`, whereas `object` is an object, and `Object.keys()` would return an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and `Object.keys()` would return an empty array when called on an empty object, whereas `object` is an object with properties, and `Object.keys()` would return
