  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(p => p.name !== undefined).map((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any policies that have an undefined `name` property, which could potentially result in some policies being ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map((policy) => [policy.name + 'foo', policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would add the string `'foo'` to the end of each policy's `name` property, which could potentially cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map((policy) => [typeof policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would use the `typeof` operator to get the type of each policy's `name` property, which could potentially return different results
