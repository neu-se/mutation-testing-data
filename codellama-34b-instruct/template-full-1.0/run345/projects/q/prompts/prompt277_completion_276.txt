  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator `>` has a higher precedence than `arguments.length`, so `arguments > 2` will be evaluated first and will result in a boolean value, which is not the intended usage of the operator `>`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(arguments.length) > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses will force the evaluation of `arguments.length` first, which is the intended usage of the operator `>`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator `!==` is used instead of `>`, which might result in different logical behavior in certain situations.

DONE.
