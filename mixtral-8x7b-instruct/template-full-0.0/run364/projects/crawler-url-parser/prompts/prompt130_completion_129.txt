 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` for the `gettype` function when the `pageurl` is `undefined` or an empty object, even if the `linkurl` has a host.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the global variable `pageurl` instead of the parameter `pageurl`, potentially causing unexpected behavior if a global variable with the same name exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.pageurl
