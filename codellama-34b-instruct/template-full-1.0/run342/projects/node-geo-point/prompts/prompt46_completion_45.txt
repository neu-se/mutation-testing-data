  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 = <PLACEHOLDER> + (0.5 * Math.PI);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the latitude value by 90 degrees, causing the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER> + (0.5 * Math.PI);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the longitude value by 90 degrees, causing the distance calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ1 = <PLACEHOLDER> + (Math.PI / 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the latitude value by 180 degrees, causing the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
