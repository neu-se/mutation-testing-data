  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would always be considered fulfilled, even if it was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would always be considered rejected, even if it was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would always be considered settled, even if it was still pending.

DONE.
