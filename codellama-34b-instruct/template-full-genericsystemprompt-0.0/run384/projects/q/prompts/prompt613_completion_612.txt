  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be replaced with `set`, which would cause the function to set the value of the property instead of getting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be replaced with `delete`, which would cause the function to delete the property instead of getting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be replaced with `post`, which would cause the function to post a message to the property instead of getting it.

DONE.
