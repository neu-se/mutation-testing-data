  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the final value of the sine of the angular distance in radians, whereas `φ1` is the initial value.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the final value of the sine of the angular distance in radians, whereas `φ1` is the initial value.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the initial value of the sine of the angular distance in radians, whereas `φ2` is the final value.

DONE.
