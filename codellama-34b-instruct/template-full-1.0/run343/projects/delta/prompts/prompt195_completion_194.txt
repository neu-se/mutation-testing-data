  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for null or undefined, but this code fragment does not, so it would treat objects and null/undefined values differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.prototype.values
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the 'values' property on the 'retain' property, but this code fragment does not, so it would treat objects with a 'values' property differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a function, but this code fragment does not, so it would treat functions differently.

DONE.
