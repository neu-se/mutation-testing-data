  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of lines, whereas the original code fragment splits the stack string into an array of lines and then filters out any lines that are not internal frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n").filter(isInternalFrame)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any lines that are not internal frames, whereas the original code fragment splits the stack string into an array of lines and then filters out any lines that are not internal frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n").filter(isInternalFrame).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any lines that are not internal frames and then join the remaining lines back into a single string, whereas the original code fragment splits the stack string into an array of lines, filters out any lines that are not
