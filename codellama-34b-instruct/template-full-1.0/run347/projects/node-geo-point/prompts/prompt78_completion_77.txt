  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.random() * 360) - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is meant to convert degrees to radians, where as this function will generate a random number between 0 and 360 and then subtract 180, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(360, Math.max(0, Math.random() * 360))
```
This would result in different behavior because this function uses the `Math.min` and `Math.max` functions to ensure that the output is always between 0 and 360, whereas the original code does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 720 - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because this function generates a random number between 0 and 720 and then subtracts 36
