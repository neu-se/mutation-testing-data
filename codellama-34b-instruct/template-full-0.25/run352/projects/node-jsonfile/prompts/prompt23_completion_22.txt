  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString()` would return a string representation of the `content` object, while `content` by itself would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.length` would return the length of the `content` object, while `content` by itself would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toJSON()` would return a JSON representation of the `content` object, while `content` by itself would return the object itself.

DONE.
