  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick.runAfter(function () {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute asynchronously, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick.runAfter(function () {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute asynchronously, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick.runAfter(function () {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute asynchronously, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
