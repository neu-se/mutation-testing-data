  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it would return a different substring of the original word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `substr`, and it would return a different substring of the original word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the original word that is one character shorter than the original substring.

DONE.
