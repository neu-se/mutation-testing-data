  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `promise` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `resolvedPromise` object with the `args` array as the second argument, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.
