  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = URL.parse('https://example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL is not actually a URL, but rather a string representing a URL. The `URL.parse` method would try to parse this string as a URL, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = URL.parse(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would try to parse a null value as a URL, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = URL.parse(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would try to parse an undefined value as a URL, which would result in an error.

DONE.
