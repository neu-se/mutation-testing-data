Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the slice length from 1 to 2, potentially including an extra operation that should not be processed, leading to incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the starting index of the slice, potentially causing it to reference an invalid or unintended operation, which could lead to incorrect results during the inversion process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex);
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively creates an empty slice, meaning no operations would be processed, which could lead to missing necessary inversions and incorrect final output.

DONE.
