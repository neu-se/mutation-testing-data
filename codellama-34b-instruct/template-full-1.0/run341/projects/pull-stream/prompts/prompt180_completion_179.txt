  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `abort` is truthy before calling `abortCb`, while the mutated code always calls `abortCb` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `array` is defined and an array before mapping its elements to a new array, while the mutated code always maps the elements of an undefined `array` to a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `i` is less than the length of `array` before returning the next element, while the mutated code always returns the last element of `array` regardless of the value of `i`.

DONE.
