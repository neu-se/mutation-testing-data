  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the fourth argument to `JSON.stringify()`, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be passed as the fourth argument to `JSON.stringify()`, which would cause it to return an empty string instead of the expected JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"foo"` would be passed as the fourth argument to `JSON.stringify()`, which would cause it to return a JSON string with the value `"foo"` instead of the expected JSON string.

DONE.
