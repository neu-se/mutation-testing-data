  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the callback throws an error, while this new code fragment would always reject the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the callback does not throw an error, while this new code fragment would always resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the callback throws an error, while this new code fragment would always reject the promise with a specific error message.

DONE.
