  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call, which would cause the function to be executed immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a bound function, which would cause the function to be executed with a different `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call, which would cause the function to be executed with a different `this` value.

DONE.
