  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This change will cause the function to return `id` if `map` is null, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return `id` if `map` is undefined, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This change will cause the function to return `id` if `map` is an empty array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
