  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while the mutated code fragment uses the value of `a + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while the mutated code fragment uses the value of `a - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while the mutated code fragment uses the value of `2 * a`.

DONE.
