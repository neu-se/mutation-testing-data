  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, that]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array with two elements, while the buggy code fragment returns an array with three elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array with two elements, while the buggy code fragment returns an array with one element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array with two elements, while the buggy code fragment returns an array with one element.

DONE.
