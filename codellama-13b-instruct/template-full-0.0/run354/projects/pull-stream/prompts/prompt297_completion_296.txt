  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function is called with the `cb` argument, which would cause the stream to end prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `data` argument, which would cause the stream to emit the data without checking if it passes the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `ended` argument, which would cause the stream to end prematurely if the `ended` variable is truthy.

DONE.
