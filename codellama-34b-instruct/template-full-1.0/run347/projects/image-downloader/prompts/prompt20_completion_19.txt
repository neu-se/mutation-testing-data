  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if a path is relative, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if a path is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.resolve('/')` resolves the path with the root directory, while `path.isAbsolute` only checks if the path is absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` extracts the parent directory of the path, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute.

DONE.
