  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the predicate function, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op => !predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the predicate function for each op, which would cause the `forEach` method to execute a different function for each op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that always returns the same value as the predicate function, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value.

DONE.
