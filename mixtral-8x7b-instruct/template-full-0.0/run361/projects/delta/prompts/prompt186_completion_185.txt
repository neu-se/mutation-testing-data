 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison using `==` checks for both value and type equality, while `===` checks for strict equality, and `undefined` is a value that is not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(thisOp).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp` is an empty object, which is not the same as checking if `thisOp.retain` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisOp.hasOwnProperty('retain') && thisOp.retain === null
