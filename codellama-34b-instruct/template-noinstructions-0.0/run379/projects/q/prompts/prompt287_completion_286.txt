  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a non-null value as its argument, and passing `null` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a non-null value as its argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a non-null value as its argument, and passing `0` would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
