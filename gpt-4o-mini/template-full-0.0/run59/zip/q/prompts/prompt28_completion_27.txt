Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` parameter is replaced with `null`, causing the `runSingle` function to attempt to execute `null`, which would lead to a runtime error instead of executing the intended task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` parameter is replaced with `null`, which means that any domain-specific behavior (like entering or exiting a domain) will not occur, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions not being managed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, task
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` parameter is incorrectly set to the `task` itself, which is not a valid domain object. This could lead to unexpected behavior when the code attempts to call `domain.enter()` or `domain.exit()`, as `task` is not a domain.

DONE.
