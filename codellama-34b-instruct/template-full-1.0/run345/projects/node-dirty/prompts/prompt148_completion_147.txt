  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.reverse()` would reverse the order of the callbacks in the `cbs` array, which could cause the callbacks to be executed in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.length` would return the number of elements in the `cbs` array, which could affect the behavior of the loop that iterates over the `cbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.pop()` would remove the last element from the `cbs` array, which could affect the behavior of the loop that iterates over the `cbs` array.

DONE.
