  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.forEach(cb => cb());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call all the callbacks in the `cbs` array, whereas the original code only calls the first callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length && cb();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the first callback if the `cbs` array has a non-zero length, whereas the original code always calls the first callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the callback to the `cbs` array, whereas the original code does not modify the `cbs` array.

DONE.
