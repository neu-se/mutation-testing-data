Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick.runAfter` function to always execute `requestTick()` when `flushing` is true, potentially leading to an infinite loop or repeated calls to `flush`, rather than only executing when `flushing` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression will always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `flushing`, causing `requestTick()` to be called every time `nextTick.runAfter` is invoked, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for equality with `false`, which could lead to unexpected results if `flushing` is not strictly a boolean value, potentially allowing `requestTick()` to be called under conditions that were not intended by the original logic.

DONE.
