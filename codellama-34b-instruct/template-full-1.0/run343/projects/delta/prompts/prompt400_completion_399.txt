  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Object.values```
This would result in different behavior because Object.values does not return the keys of an object, but rather its values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Object.entries```
This would result in different behavior because Object.entries returns an array of key-value pairs, which could lead to different behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Object.prototype```
This would result in different behavior because Object.prototype is a different object than Object.keys, could potentially lead to different behavior in the code.

DONE.
