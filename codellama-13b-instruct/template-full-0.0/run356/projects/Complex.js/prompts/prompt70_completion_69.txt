  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.match(/[a-zA-Z]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of all the words in the string, rather than the original code fragment which would return the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.match(/[0-9]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of all the numbers in the string, rather than the original code fragment which would return the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of all the alphanumeric characters in the string, rather than the original code fragment which would return the first match.

DONE.
