  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression `abort && true` would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which would cause the stream to be closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression `!abort || true` would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which would cause the stream to be closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator
