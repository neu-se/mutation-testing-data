  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` method would return a value that is off by one, potentially causing the `load` event to be emitted too early or too late.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` method would return a value that is off by one, potentially causing the `load` event to be emitted too early or too late.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` method would return a value that is twice the actual size of the data, potentially causing the `load` event to be emitted too early or too late.

DONE.
