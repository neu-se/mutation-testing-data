  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a no-op function that does nothing, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a method that creates a new function with a specific signature.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is an arithmetic expression that returns a value, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a method that creates a new function with a specific signature.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("test")` throws an error with the message "test", whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` creates a new function with a specific signature.

DONE.
