  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(id, options) => null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would always return `null`, regardless of the `id` or `options` provided. This would break the functionality of the `getCountry` function and likely cause errors in the code that relies on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(id, options) => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would always return an empty object, regardless of the `id` or `options` provided. This would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to fail because it relies on the `country` object returned by `getCountry` to have a `timezones` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(id, options) => { return { ...data.countries[id], ...options }; }
```
