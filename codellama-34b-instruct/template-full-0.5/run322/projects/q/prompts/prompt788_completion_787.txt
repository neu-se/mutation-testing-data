  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fail` would not be called with the expected `promise` argument, leading to a different error message or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fail` would not be called with the expected `promise` argument, leading to a different error message or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fail` would be called with a rejected promise, leading to a different error message or behavior.

DONE.
