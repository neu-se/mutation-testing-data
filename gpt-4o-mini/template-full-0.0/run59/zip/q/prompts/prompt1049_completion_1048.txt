Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting with the original error, the queue would reject with `null`, which may not provide any meaningful information about the failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Queue closed"
```
This would result in different behavior because the queue would reject with a string message instead of the original error object, which could lead to confusion when handling the rejection since it would not be an instance of `Error`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the queue would reject with a new error message instead of the original error, potentially masking the actual issue that caused the queue to close.

DONE.
