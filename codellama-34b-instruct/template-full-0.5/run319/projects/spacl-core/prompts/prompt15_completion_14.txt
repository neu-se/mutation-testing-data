  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.search` returns the index of the first match, while `spec.match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.replace` replaces the first match with a new string, while `spec.match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.split` splits the string into an array of substrings, while `spec.match` returns an array of all matches.

DONE.
