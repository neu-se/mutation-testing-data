 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets `ended` to true, even if `end` is true. The original code only sets `ended` to true if `end` is true and `test(data)` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && !end
