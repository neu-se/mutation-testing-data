  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is a boolean, so using `===` would ensure that the type is also checked, which may be important for the correct functioning of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method returns the primitive value of the object, which in this case would be a boolean. The `!` operator would then negate that value, resulting in the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the object, which would be negated by the `
