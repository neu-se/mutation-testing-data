 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's second argument (`index`) would be `null` for the first iteration, causing potential issues if the callback is not equipped to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's second argument (`index`) would be replaced with a constant value, causing all elements in the resulting array to be the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's second argument (`index`) would be replaced with the value of `this`, which could cause issues if the callback is expecting a number and instead receives an object.

DONE.
