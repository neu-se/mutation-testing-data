  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` function would be called with a `null` instead of an object, which would cause it to throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` function would be called with an `undefined` instead of an object, which would cause it to throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` function would be called with an empty object instead of an object, which would cause it to return a promise that resolves to an empty object instead of a promise that resolves to the original object.

DONE.
