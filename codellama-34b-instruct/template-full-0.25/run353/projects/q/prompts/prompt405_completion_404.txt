  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a new rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a method that creates a new rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a new resolved promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

DONE.
