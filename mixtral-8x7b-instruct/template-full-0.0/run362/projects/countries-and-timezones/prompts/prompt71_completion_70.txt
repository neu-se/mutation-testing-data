 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `name` as an object instead of using it as the `name` parameter in the `buildTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
buildTimezone(timezone, name)
