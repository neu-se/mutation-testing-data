  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the line and retain the second character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the line index by 1, which could cause the iterator to skip over the first character of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the line index by 1, which could cause the iterator to skip over the last character of the line.

DONE.
