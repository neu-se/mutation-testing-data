  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` is the first element of the `args` array, whereas `args` is the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` is the slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, whereas `args` is the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` is the number of elements in the `args` array, whereas `args` is the entire array.

DONE.
