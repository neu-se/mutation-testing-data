  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.throwerror;
```
This would result in different behavior because `throwError` is not a function in the `Q` library, so it would cause an error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    throw new Error("This is a custom error message");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message would be thrown instead of the original error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid argument, so the function would not throw an error.

DONE.
