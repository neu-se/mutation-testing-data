  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'end' event instead of the 'error' event, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different message, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.substring(0, 10)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different message, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
