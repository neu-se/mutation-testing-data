  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `true` condition would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `if` statement to always execute. This would cause the function to always return `null`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `false` condition would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to never execute. This would cause the function to always return the original `baseUrlStr`, regardless of whether it contains illegal characters or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && baseUrlStr.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition would check whether the `baseUrl
