Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the trigonometric function from cosine to sine, which will yield different results for the calculation of `cos(x) - 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input to the cosine function by adding 1, which will produce a different output than the original `Math.cos(x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(x) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of the cosine function, which will not match the intended calculation of `cos(x) - 1`.

DONE.
