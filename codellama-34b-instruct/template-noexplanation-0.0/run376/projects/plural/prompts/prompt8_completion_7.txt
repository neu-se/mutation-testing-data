  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This change will cause the `addRule` function to add the rule in reverse order, with the result first and the match second. This will likely cause the `plural` function to return incorrect results for some words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result, "bug"]
```
This change will cause the `addRule` function to add an extra element to the rule array, which will likely cause the `plural` function to return incorrect results for some words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result, result]
```
This change will cause the `addRule` function to add the same rule twice, which will likely cause the `plural` function to return incorrect results for some words.

DONE.
