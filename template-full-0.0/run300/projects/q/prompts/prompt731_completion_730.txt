  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` value would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `notify` function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` value would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `notify` function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` value would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `notify` function to be called with a different value than expected.

DONE.
