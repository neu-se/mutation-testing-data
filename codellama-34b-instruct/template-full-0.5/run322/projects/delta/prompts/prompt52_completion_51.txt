  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a == (b + 1)` instead of `(a == b) + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has a higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a == (b - 1)` instead of `(a == b) - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a == (b * 2)` instead of `(a == b) * 2`.

DONE.
