Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${cssMapping.sourceRoot || ''}${source.toUpperCase()} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because the source URL is converted to uppercase, potentially affecting how the source map is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${source} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sourceRoot` property of `cssMapping` is ignored, which could lead to incorrect source map resolution if the source root is not the current working directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${cssMapping.sources[0]} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because only the first source of the source map is used as the source URL, potentially causing issues if there are multiple sources.

DONE.
