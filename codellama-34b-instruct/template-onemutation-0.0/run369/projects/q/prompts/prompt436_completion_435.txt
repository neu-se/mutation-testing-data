  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is in the unhandled rejections array, while the modified code fragment checks if the promise is at a specific index in the array.

DONE.
