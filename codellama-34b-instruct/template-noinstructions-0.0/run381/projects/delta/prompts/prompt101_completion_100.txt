  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove the last element from the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `chop()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` would remove the first element from the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `chop()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` would remove the first element from the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `chop()` method.

DONE.
