  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, and it would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `writeFile`, and it would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile` is a synchronous version of `writeFile`, and it would not be equivalent to the original code.

DONE.
