  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted element would be placed after the existing element at the given index instead of before it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted element would be placed before the existing element at the given index instead of after it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted element would be placed at a different index than the given index. The multiplication would cause the index to be increased or decreased, depending on the value of the existing element at that index.

DONE.
