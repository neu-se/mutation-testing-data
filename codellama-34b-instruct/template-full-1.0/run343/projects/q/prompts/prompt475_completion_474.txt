  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of `reportedUnhandledRejections` and the subsequent `=== -1` check would fail, resulting in the `if` block not executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the second element of `reportedUnhandledRejections` and the subsequent `=== 1` check would fail, resulting in the `if` block not executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of `reportedUnhandledRejections` and the subsequent `== -1` check would fail, resulting in the `if` block not executing.

DONE.
