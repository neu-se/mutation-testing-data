  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different string than "throw", and it would cause the `continuer` function to behave differently when it is called with the "throw" verb.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because "next" is a different string than "throw", and it would cause the `continuer` function to behave differently when it is called with the "throw" verb.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because "reject" is a different string than "throw", and it would cause the `continuer` function to behave differently when it is called with the "throw" verb.

DONE.
