  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a function, but `null` is not, so the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { }
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a function, but `() => { }` is a function that returns nothing, so the code would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rejected) => { }
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a function that takes no arguments, but `(rejected) => { }` is a function that takes one argument, so the code would not work as intended.

DONE.
