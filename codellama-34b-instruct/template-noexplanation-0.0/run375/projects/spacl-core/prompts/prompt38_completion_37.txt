  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it slices the array returned by `split` to exclude the first element, which is an empty string. This change may cause the `compile` function to produce different results for certain input strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(-1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it slices the array returned by `split` to include only the last element, which is the last segment of the path. This change may cause the `compile` function to produce different results for certain input strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it slices the array returned by `split` to exclude the last element, which is the last segment of the path. This change may cause the `compile` function to produce different results
