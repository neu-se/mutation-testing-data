  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).then(function(value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to modify the resolved value of the promise returned by `dispatch`, which would not be present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).catch(function(error) {
    return error.message;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the `dispatch` method, which would not be present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).finally(function() {
    return "done";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is used to execute a callback function regardless of whether the
