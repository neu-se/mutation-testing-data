  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` expects a callback function as an argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the callback function to be called with `null` as the argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` expects a callback function as an argument, but `undefined` is being passed instead. This would cause the callback function to be called with `undefined` as the argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` expects a callback function as an argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the callback function to be called with no arguments, which could
