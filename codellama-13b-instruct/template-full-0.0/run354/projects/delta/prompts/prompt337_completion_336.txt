  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting from the current index and ending at the next index, rather than the entire base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting from the current index and ending at the current index plus the length of the current operation, rather than the entire base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta starting from the current index and ending at the current index plus 10, rather than the entire base delta.

DONE.
