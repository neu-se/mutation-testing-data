  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length()` is a method that returns the length of an `Op` object, while `Op.length` is a property that represents the length of an `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a property that represents the length of an `Op` object, while `Op.length + 1` is a mathematical expression that adds 1 to the length of an `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a property that represents the length of an `Op` object, while `Op.length - 1` is a mathematical expression that subtracts 1 from the length of an `Op` object.

DONE.
