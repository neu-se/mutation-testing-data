 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { throw new Error('The options.url is required'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning a rejected promise with an error, it throws an error synchronously, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise instead of rejecting it, which would not handle cases where the `options.url` is missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required')).then(() => { /* do nothing */ })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty `then` block after the rejected promise, which would cause the function to not propagate the error correctly.

DONE.
