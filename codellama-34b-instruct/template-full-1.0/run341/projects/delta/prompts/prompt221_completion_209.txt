  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = (0,0);
```
This would result in different behavior because currently x is defined as a combination of 2 numbers, but this change would define it as a single number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var y = (x + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because x is no longer being compared to 0, but instead to y (x + 2).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var z = (x[0] + y[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sum of x and y is being calculated and stored in z, but x and z are different variables.

DONE.
