  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `false` for any path that is not governed by this rule, even if it matches the rule's regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `false` for any path that is not governed by this rule, even if it matches the rule's regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `false` for any path that is not governed by this rule, even if it matches the rule's regular expression.

DONE.
