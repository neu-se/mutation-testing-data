  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the angle of the
complex number, leading to a different calculation of the sin and cos values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the angle of the
complex number, leading to a different calculation of the sin and cos values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the angle of the
complex number, leading to a different calculation of the sin and cos values.

DONE.
