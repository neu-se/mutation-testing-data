  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error object, whereas the original code throws the exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code because it would continue to throw the same exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not throw an error and the code would continue to execute as if the error had not occurred.

DONE.
