Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hasNext` method to always return `false` when the index is at the end of the operations array, preventing any further operations from being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check for the next operation, potentially skipping over the current operation and leading to unexpected results when calling `rest()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would alter the condition to check for the next operation based on the offset instead of the index, which could lead to incorrect behavior when determining if there are more operations to process.

DONE.
