  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a promise that resolves to a value, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a promise that rejects with a reason. In the original code, the `image` function returns a promise that rejects with a reason if the `url` or `dest` options are not provided. If we replace the `Promise.reject` with `Promise.resolve`, the function will return a promise that resolves to a value even if the `url` or `dest` options are not provided, which may not give the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.` is an invalid syntax. If we replace `Promise.reject` with `Promise.`, the code will throw a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
