  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` finds all matches in a string, while `search` finds the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/(?:)/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `(?:)` matches zero-width characters, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace('//', ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `//` matches two slashes, which would be replaced with a space, resulting in different behavior.

DONE.
