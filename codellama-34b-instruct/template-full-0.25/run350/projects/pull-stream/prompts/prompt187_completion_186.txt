  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `undefined` is not. If the `array` argument is `undefined`, the original code would return `null`, but the mutated code would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number". If the `array` argument is `NaN`, the original code would return `null`, but the mutated code would return `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `''` (empty string) is not. If the `array` argument is `''`, the original code would return `null`, but the mutated code would return `''`.

DONE.
