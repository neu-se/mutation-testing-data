  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `|` operator to match either `x`, `ch`, or `s` at the end of the word, while the buggy code fragment uses the same operator to match `x`, `ch`, or `s` followed by `es`. This would result in different plural forms for words that end in `x`, `ch`, or `s`, such as "box" becoming "boxes" instead of "boxes".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
