  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.unpipe
```
This would result in different behavior because `unpipe` is a method that removes the `WritableStream` from the `Stream` pipeline, whereas `pipe` adds a `WritableStream` to the `Stream` pipeline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.flash
```
This would result in different behavior because `flash` is a method that removes the `ReadableStream` from the `Stream` pipeline, whereas `pipe` adds a `WritableStream` to the `Stream` pipeline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.write('test')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write` is a method that writes a string or buffer to the `Stream`, whereas `pipe` adds a `WritableStream` to the `Stream` pipeline.

DONE.
