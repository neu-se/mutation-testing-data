  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This change will cause the code to always use the HTTPS protocol, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + 'https://'
```
This change will cause the code to use both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + 'https://' + 'ftp://'
```
This change will cause the code to use all three protocols, which may not be desirable in all cases.

DONE.
