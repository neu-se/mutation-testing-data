  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a policy as the value for the map, but a null value would cause the set method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"policy"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a policy as the value for the map, but a string value would cause the set method to insert a new key-value pair with the string as the key and the policy as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a policy as the value for the map, but a string value (the policy name) would cause the set method to insert a new key-value pair with the policy name as the key and the policy as the value.

DONE.
