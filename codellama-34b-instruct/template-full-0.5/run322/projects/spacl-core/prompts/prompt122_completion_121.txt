  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.search` is a method that searches for a specified value within a string, whereas `path.match` is a method that matches a string against a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings, whereas `path.match` is a method that matches a string against a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace` is a method that replaces a specified value within a string, whereas `path.match` is a method that matches a string against a regular expression.

DONE.
