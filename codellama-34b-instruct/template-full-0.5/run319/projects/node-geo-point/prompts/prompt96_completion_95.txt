  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a different function than `atan2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * y` is a different calculation than `atan2(y, x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y / x
```
This would result in different behavior because `y / x` is a different calculation than `atan2(y, x)`.

DONE.
