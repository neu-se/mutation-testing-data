  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp[action], otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a method that returns a handler function for a specific operation, but the code fragment above is not using the returned handler function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.retain, thisOp[action])
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `Delta.getHandler` is reversed, which could cause the handler function to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp[action], otherOp.retain, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `Delta.getHandler` is a boolean value that indicates whether the handler function should be returned, but the code fragment above is not using the returned handler function.

DONE.
