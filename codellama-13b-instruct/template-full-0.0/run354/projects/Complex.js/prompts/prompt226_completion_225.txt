  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of the real part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the square root of the magnitude of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the real part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the magnitude of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the hypotenuse of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the magnitude of the complex number.

DONE.
