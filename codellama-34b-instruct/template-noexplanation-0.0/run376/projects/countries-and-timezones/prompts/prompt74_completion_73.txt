  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive a different input than expected, which may cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive a different input than expected, which may cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive a different input than expected, which may cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

DONE.
