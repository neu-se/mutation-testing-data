  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is not defined. This could cause the code to behave differently in environments where `window` is not defined, such as in a web worker or a Node.js environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object. This could cause the code to behave differently in environments where `window` is not an object, such as in a web worker or a Node.js environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a function. This could cause the code to behave differently in environments
