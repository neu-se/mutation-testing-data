  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `desiredLines.length` is a number, whereas `desiredLines.join()` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat("dummy");
```
This would result in different behavior because `desiredLines.concat("dummy")` adds a new element to the array, whereas `desiredLines.join()` does not modify the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines.join("\n");
```
This would result in different behavior because `lines.join("\n")` joins the entire array of lines, whereas `desiredLines.join()` only joins the `desiredLines` array.

DONE.
