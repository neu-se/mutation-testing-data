 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `"rejected"`, since it's calling the `state` property on an empty object, which is always truthy and will not trigger the rejection branch in the ternary operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reference the `state` property of the `inspect` function object itself, rather than calling the `inspect` method on the current promise instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function(){}).state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `state` property of an empty function expression, which does not exist, and would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

DONE.
