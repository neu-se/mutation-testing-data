  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
'cilaps'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "chilli" is misspelled as "cilap".

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "chillis" is the correct plural form of "chilli", and the code would produce different output.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "chillies" is the correct plural form of "chilli", and the code would produce different output.

DONE.
