  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, so if the base URL has illegal characters, the function will return `true` instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && false
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` at the end of the expression will always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the result of the `_has_
