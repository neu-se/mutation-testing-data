  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise, while the modified code fragment would reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(promise, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise immediately, while the modified code fragment would delay the resolution of the promise by 1 second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.timeout(promise, 1000, "Test timeout");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise immediately, while the modified code fragment would timeout the promise after 1 second and reject it with an error.

DONE.
