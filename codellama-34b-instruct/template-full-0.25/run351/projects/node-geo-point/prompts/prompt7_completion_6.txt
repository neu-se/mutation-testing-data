  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || !Array.isArray(point.coordinates) || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'` or if the `coordinates` property is not an array or does not have a length of 2, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `type` and `coordinates` properties do not exist on the `point` object or if the `coordinates` property does not have a length of 2, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type')
