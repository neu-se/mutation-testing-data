  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the intention of the original code was to check if the context is undefined, while the new fragment checks if it is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if the context is undefined, while the new fragment checks if the context is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if the context is undefined, while the new fragment checks if the context is equal to false.

DONE.
