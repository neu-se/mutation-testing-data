  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will always reject the promise, regardless of the outcome of `callback.fcall(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve(value)` will always resolve the promise with the value `value`, regardless of the outcome of `callback.fcall(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function(result) { return result + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `then` will always increment the result of `callback.fcall(value)` by 1, regardless of the outcome of `callback.fcall(value)`.

DONE.
