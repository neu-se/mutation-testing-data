  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns `true` if either operand is truthy. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which returns `true` if both operands are truthy. This means that the replacement code fragment will only return `true` if both `window` and `self` are defined, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if either `window` or `self` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" ^ typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns `true` if either operand is truthy. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`), which returns `true` if the operands have different truthiness values. This means that the replacement code fragment will
