object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `object` is an object that does not have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then(function() { return value; })` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `function() { return value; }` function, whereas `object` is an object that does not have a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function() { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then(function() { throw reason; })` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the reason thrown by the `function() { throw reason; }` function, whereas `object` is an object that does not have
