  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `length` is equal to `opLength - offset`, the original code would enter the `else` block and return the `retain` operation, while the mutated code would enter the `if` block and return the `delete` operation instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `length` is less than or equal to `opLength - offset`, the original code would enter the `if` block and return the `delete` operation, while the mutated code would enter the `else` block and return the `retain` operation instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= opLength
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `length` is greater than or equal to `opLength`, the original code would enter the `else` block and return the `retain` operation,
