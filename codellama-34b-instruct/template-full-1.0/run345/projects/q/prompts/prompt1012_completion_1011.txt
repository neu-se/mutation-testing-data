  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not defined in the code snippet, and adding it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject()` function is not defined in the code snippet, and adding it would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve()` function is not defined in the code snippet, and adding it would cause an error.

DONE.
