  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to consider deletions as insertions, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to consider retains as insertions, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to consider insertions with a length of 0 as insertions, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
