  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` will create a pending promise, causing the `when` method to break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, causing the `when` method to break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` will cause the `when` method to break due to a type error.

DONE.
