  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that resolves to the length of the `promises` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that resolves to the first element of the `promises` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that resolves to a copy of the `promises` array, rather than the array itself.

DONE.
