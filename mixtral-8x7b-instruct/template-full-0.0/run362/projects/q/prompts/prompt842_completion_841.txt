 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(object, ms, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` does not have a `timeout` method, and it would raise a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).spread(timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).spread` expects an array or a promise for an array, and `timeout` is a number. This would raise a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.all([object]).timeout(ms, error)
