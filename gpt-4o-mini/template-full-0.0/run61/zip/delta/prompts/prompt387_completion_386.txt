Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length by 1, potentially causing the transformation to process more characters than intended, leading to incorrect results in the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, which could lead to mismatched operations and incorrect transformations when combining the two `Delta` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it ensures that the length is always non-negative, which could mask potential issues with negative lengths and lead to unexpected behavior in the transformation logic.

DONE.
