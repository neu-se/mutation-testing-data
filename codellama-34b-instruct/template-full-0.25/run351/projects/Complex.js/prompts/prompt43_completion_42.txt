  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not `undefined` and not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined || a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not `undefined` or not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined && a !== null && a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is `undefined` or `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not `undefined`, not `null`, and not equal to `0`.

DONE.
