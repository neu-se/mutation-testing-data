  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality between `a` and `b`, rather than checking if `b` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined && b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both `a` and `b` are not undefined, rather than just checking if `b` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined || b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `a` or `b` is not undefined, rather than just checking if `b` is undefined.

DONE.
