  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `current` and `all` arrays to contain the same values, which may not be the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` array to always be empty, which may not be the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `current` array to always be empty, which may not be the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
