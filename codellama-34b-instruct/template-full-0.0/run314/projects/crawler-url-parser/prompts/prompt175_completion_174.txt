  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a second argument of `true`, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a second argument of `false`, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a second argument of `null`, which would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
