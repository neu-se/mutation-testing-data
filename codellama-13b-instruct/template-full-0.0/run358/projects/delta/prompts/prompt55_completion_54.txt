  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(null)` returns `false`, while the original code fragment `Array.isArray` returns `true` for any value, including `null`. This could cause issues in the code if the developer relies on the behavior of `Array.isArray` to check if a value is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(undefined)` returns `false`, while the original code fragment `Array.isArray` returns `true` for any value, including `undefined`. This could cause issues in the code if the developer relies on the behavior of `Array.isArray` to check if a value is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(1)`
