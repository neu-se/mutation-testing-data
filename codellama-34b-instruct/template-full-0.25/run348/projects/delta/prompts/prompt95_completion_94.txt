  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the existing op at the specified index with the new op, rather than inserting the new op at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the specified index, rather than replacing the existing op at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 2, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the existing op at the specified index and the next op with the new op, rather than inserting the new op at the specified index.

DONE.
