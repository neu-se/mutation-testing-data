  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional `then` handler to the promise chain, which would return `null` instead of the original value. This would cause the `for` loop to iterate over an empty array, instead of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.catch(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional `catch` handler to the promise chain, which would return `null` instead of the original value. This would cause the `for` loop to iterate over an empty array, instead of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional `then` handler to the promise chain, which would throw an error instead of returning the original
