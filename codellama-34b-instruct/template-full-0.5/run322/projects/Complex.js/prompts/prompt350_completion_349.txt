  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `a` and affect the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the value of `a` and affect the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a` and would change the calculations.

DONE.
