  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a null value, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with an undefined value, which is also not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a zero value, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
