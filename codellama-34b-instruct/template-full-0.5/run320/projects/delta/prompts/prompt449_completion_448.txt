  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's a string. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op.delete` is a number, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the code that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's defined. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `op.delete` is not a number, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the code that follows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if
