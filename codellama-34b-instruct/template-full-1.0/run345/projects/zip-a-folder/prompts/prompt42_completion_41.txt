  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.append
```
This would result in different behavior because `append` expects a file path as an argument, whereas `glob` expects a glob pattern that matches multiple files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zarchive.directory(globPart, { ignore })
```
This would result in different behavior because `ignores` parameters are used to determine which files should be excluded from the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file(globPart)
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` expects a single file as an argument, whereas `glob` matches multiple files.

DONE.
