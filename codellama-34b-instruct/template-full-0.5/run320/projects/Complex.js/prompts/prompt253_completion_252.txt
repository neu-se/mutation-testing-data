  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `Math.atan2` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the complex exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the `Math.atan2` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the complex exponent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the `Math.atan2` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the complex exponent.

DONE.
