Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
module.exports = function abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort) {
  cb(abort)
  onAbort && onAbort(<PLACEHOLDER>)
  return
}


```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
abort === true ? null: abort
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
