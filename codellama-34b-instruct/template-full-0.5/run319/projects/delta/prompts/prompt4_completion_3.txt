  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different objects, and `a` may not have the same properties as `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it may not be equivalent to the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it may not be equivalent to the value of `b`.

DONE.
