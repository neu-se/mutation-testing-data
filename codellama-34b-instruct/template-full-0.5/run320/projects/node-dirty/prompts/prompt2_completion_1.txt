  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` list would not be cleared after the data is persisted to disk, leading to duplicate callbacks being called multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` list would be reset to an empty array after the data is persisted to disk, leading to lost callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` list would be cleared after the data is persisted to disk, leading to lost callbacks.

DONE.
