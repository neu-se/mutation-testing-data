  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different property than `attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different property than `attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

DONE.
