  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because a negative retain value is not allowed in Quill, and it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the operation retain the same number of characters as the current operation, which may not be the same as the number of characters retained by the other operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because an insert operation may not have a retain property, and it would throw an error if it doesn't.

DONE.
