Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to call `done` on `null`, leading to a runtime error instead of processing the promise as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to call `done` on `undefined`, which would also lead to a runtime error, preventing any promise resolution or rejection handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of a promise object would cause the `done` method to be invoked on a string, which is not a valid promise, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
