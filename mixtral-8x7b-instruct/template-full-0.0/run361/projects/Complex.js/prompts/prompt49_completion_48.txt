 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof a['abs'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type of `a['abs']` instead of using the `Number.isFinite` function, which checks if a value is a finite number. This change may cause issues when dealing with non-finite numbers like Infinity or NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isNaN(a['abs'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a['abs']` is not NaN instead of using the `Number.isFinite` function, which checks if a value is a finite number. This change may cause issues when dealing with non-finite numbers like Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a['abs']) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the absolute value of `a['abs']` is greater than 0 instead
