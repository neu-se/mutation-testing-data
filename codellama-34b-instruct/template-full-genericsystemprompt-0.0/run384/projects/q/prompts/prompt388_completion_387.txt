  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a null callback, which would result in a no-op and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a callback that throws an error, which would result in the promise being rejected with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject("Test rejection"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a callback that returns a rejected promise, which would result in the promise being rejected with the rejection reason.

DONE.
