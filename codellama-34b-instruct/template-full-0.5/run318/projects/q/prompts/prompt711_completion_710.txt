  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for the object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"forEach"
```
This would result in different behavior because "forEach" is a method that iterates over the elements of an array, but it does not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"then"
```
This would result in different behavior because "then" is a method that is used to chain promises, but it does not return a promise.

DONE.
