  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is not a valid method, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is not a valid method, and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for `nodeArgs.push()`, and would throw an error.

DONE.
