  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the key as a string, while this code fragment uses the key as a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the key as a string, while this code fragment uses the key as a concatenated string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the key as a string, while this code fragment uses the key as a string concatenated with undefined.

DONE.
