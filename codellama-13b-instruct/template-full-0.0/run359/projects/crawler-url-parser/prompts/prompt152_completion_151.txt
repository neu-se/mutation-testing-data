  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the number of parts in the link URL is one more than the number of parts in the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the number of parts in the link URL is one less than the number of parts in the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the number of parts in the link URL is not equal to the number of parts in the page URL.

DONE.
