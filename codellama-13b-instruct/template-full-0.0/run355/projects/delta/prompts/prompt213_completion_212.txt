  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other delta onto the current delta, rather than concatenating the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the next operation from the other delta onto the current delta, rather than pushing it onto the current delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the next operation from the other delta onto the current delta's ops array, rather than pushing it onto the current delta.

DONE.
