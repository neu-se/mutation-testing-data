  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` is a different object than `ref`, and it would not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` would return a new array with the same elements as `ref`, but without the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })` would return a new array with the same elements as `ref`, but with each element incremented by 1.

DONE.
