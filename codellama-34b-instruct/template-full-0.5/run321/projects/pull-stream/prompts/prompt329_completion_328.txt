  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `op` is a function that is called with the argument `data`, while `op + 1` is a different function that is called with the argument `data + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `op` is a function that is called with the argument `data`, while `op * 2` is a different function that is called with the argument `data * 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `op` is a function that is called with the argument `data`, while `op - 1` is a different function that is called with the argument `data - 1`.

DONE.
