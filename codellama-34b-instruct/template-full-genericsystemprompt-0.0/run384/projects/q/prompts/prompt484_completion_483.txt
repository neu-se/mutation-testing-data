  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array that is the concatenation of `unhandledReasons` and an empty array, rather than a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array that contains only the elements of `unhandledReasons` that pass the filter function, rather than a reference to the original array.

DONE.
