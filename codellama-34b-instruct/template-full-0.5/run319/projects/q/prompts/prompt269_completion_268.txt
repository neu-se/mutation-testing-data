  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Buggy code"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.reject` method to be called with a different argument, which would result in a different rejection reason and potentially different downstream behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error("Buggy code"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve` method to be called with a different argument, which would result in a different resolution value and potentially different downstream behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(new Error("Buggy code"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called with a different argument, which would result in a different fulfillment value and potentially different downstream behavior.

DONE.
