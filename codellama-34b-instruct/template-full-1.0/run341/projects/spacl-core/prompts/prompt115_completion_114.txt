  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will return a copy of the `verbs` array without its first element, while the original code fragment would iterate over all elements in the `verbs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.map(v => !v)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` will return a new array with each element transformed by the provided function, while the original code fragment would iterate over all elements in the `verbs` array and modify them in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(v => v)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` will return a new array containing only the elements of `verbs` that satisfy the provided function, while the original code fragment would iterate over all elements in the `verbs` array and modify only those that satisfy the condition.

DONE.
