  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function and `read + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function and `read - 1` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function and `read / 2` is a number.

DONE.
