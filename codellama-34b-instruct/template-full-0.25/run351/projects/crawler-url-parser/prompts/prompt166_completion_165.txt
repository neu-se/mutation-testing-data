  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the difference in the number of path parts is equal to -1, whereas this replacement checks if the difference is greater than -1. This means that if the number of path parts in the link URL is greater than the number of path parts in the page URL, the link will be considered internal, even if the link URL does not include the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the difference in the number of path parts is equal to -1, whereas this replacement checks if the difference is not equal to -1. This means that if the number of path parts in the link URL is not equal to the number of path parts in the page URL, the link will be considered internal, even if the link URL does not include the page URL.
