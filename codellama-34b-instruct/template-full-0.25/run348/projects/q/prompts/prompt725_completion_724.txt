  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` returns the current state of the promise, whereas `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's state at the time it was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.value` returns the resolved value of the promise, whereas `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's state at the time it was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reason` returns the rejection reason of the promise, whereas `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's state at the time it was called.

DONE.
