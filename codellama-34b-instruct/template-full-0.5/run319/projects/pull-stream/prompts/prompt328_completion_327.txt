  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is always truthy, so the `op` function would be called regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` expression would be evaluated first, and if it is truthy, the `op` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is always truthy, so the `op` function would be called regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
