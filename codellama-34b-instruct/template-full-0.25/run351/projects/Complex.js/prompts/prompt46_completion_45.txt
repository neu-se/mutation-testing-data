  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im'] && a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the 'im' and 're' properties exist on the object, but it would not check if they are truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im'] && !a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the 'im' property exists and the 're' property does not exist on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im'] && a['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the 'im' property exists and the 're' property is equal to 0.

DONE.
