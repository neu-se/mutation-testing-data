  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDistance` will return `null` instead of a number, and the `toString` method will output "null" instead of a string representation of the geo point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method will compute the distance between the `longitude` of the current geo point and the `latitude` of the `point` geo point, rather than computing the distance between the two geo points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude; point.longitude;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method will compute the distance between the `latitude` of the current geo point and the `longitude` of the `point` geo point, rather than computing the distance between the two geo points.
