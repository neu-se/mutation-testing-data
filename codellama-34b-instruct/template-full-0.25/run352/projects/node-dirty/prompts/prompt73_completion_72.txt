  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error code is now checking for a different type of error, specifically "EACCES" which means permission denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error code is now checking for a different type of error, specifically "EISDIR" which means the path is a directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error code is now checking for a different type of error, specifically "ENOTDIR" which means the path is not a directory.

DONE.
