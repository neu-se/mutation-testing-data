 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the bootstrap function would receive a `null` value instead of an object, causing the CommonJS, RequireJS, and SES paths to not initialize Q properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the bootstrap function would receive a number instead of an object, causing the CommonJS, RequireJS, and SES paths to not initialize Q properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the bootstrap function would receive an empty object instead of a function, causing the CommonJS, RequireJS, and SES paths to not initialize Q properly.

These changes would expose potential issues in the test suite by revealing that it does not account for incorrect initialization data, which should cause the tests to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
