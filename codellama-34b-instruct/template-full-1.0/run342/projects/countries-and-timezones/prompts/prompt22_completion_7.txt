  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the incorrect property name for the DST offset. The code would attempt to use a property named "d" rather than "dstOffset", which is the correct property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the DST offset, which would result in an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the DST offset, which would result in an incorrect value.

DONE.
