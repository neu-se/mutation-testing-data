  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a `Promise` object, so it would not have a `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a `Promise` object, so it would not have a `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q().then(function() { return Q(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the timing of the `promiseDispatch` call. Instead of being called immediately, it would be called after a tick, which could be significant if the function expected to be called synchronously.

DONE.
