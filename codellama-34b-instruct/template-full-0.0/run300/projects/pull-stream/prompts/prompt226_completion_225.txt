  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) && data.length > 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only return `true` if `data` is not empty, whereas the original function would return `true` for any non-empty `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) || data.length === 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if `data` is empty, whereas the original function would only return `true` for non-empty `data`.

DONE.
