  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = z['im'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be doubled, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = z['re'] - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number would be decremented by 1, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = -z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be negated, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
