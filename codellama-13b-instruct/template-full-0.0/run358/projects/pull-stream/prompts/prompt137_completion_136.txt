  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now set to `10`, which would cause the `infinite` function to return `10` instead of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now set to `null`, which would cause the `infinite` function to return `null` instead of `10`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now set to `undefined`, which would cause the `infinite` function to return `undefined` instead of `10`.

DONE.
