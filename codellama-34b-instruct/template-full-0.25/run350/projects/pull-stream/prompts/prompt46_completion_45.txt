  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the function to skip the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to skip the first few arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to skip the first few arguments.

DONE.
