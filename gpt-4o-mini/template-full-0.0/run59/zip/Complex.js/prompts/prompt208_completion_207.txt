Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` computes the arctangent of a number, which does not take into account the signs of both arguments, potentially leading to incorrect angle calculations compared to `Math.atan2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b + 1, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `b` changes the input to the `atan2` function, which could lead to a different angle being calculated, thus affecting the final result of the complex exponentiation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because swapping the order of the arguments in `Math.atan2` changes the quadrant in which the angle is calculated, potentially resulting in an incorrect angle for the complex exponentiation.

DONE.
