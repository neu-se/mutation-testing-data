 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && "someString"
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison with `operands[1]` has been replaced with a constant string, so the result of the condition will always be either true or false, regardless of the value of `operands[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "then"
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison with `operands[1]` has been replaced with a constant boolean value, so the condition will always be either true or false, regardless of the value of `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison with `operands[1]` has been replaced with `operands[0]`, so the condition will now depend on the value of `operands[0]` instead of `operands[1]`.

DONE.
