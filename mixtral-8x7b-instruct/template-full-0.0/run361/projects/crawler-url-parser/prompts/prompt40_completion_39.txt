 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.host === null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `===` operator for comparison instead of `==`. This strict equality check may cause the condition to fail even when the `host` property is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!parsedUrl.host && baseUrlStr
