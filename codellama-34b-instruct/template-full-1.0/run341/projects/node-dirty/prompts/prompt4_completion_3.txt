  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the key to `undefined`, regardless of whether the original code fragment set it to `null` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the key to `null`, regardless of whether the original code fragment set it to `undefined` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the `_data` map, regardless of whether the original code fragment set it to `undefined` or not.

DONE.
