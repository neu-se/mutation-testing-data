  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This change will cause the `update` method to call `set` instead of `get`, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This change will cause the `update` method to call `rm` instead of `get`, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.forEach
```
This change will cause the `update` method to call `forEach` instead of `get`, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
