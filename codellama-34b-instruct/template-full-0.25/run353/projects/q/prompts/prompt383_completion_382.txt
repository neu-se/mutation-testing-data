  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the `callback` function with a specific `this` value, which is `null` in this case. This means that the `callback` function will not have access to the `this` value of the original context, which could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke the `callback` function with a specific `this` value, which is `null` in this case. This means that the `callback` function will not have access to the `this` value of the original context, which could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new
