```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and the code inside the `if` block would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and the code inside the `if` block would be executed.

DONE.
