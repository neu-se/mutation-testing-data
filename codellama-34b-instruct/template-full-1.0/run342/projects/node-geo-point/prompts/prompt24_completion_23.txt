  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')` is a more explicit check for the presence of the property `longitude` on the given `object`, whereas `object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')` is a more general check that just checks for the presence of the property, regardless of its origin.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty &&` is a check for the presence of the `hasOwnProperty` method on the given `object`, so if that method is not present, the expression will always evaluate to `false`. Adding `object.hasOwnProperty &&` to the beginning of the expression ensures that the method is present before checking for the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
