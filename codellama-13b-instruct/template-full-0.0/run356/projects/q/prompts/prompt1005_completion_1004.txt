  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.npost` is a different method than `Q`, and it would cause the code to use the `npost` method instead of the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.ninvoke` is a different method than `Q`, and it would cause the code to use the `ninvoke` method instead of the `invoke` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a different method than `Q`, and it would cause the code to use the `nfapply` method instead of the `fapply` method.

DONE.
