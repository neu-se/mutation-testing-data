  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would not have the same `this` context as the original `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, which could affect the behavior of the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
