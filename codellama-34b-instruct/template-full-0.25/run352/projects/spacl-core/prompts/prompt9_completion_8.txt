  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method checks if the regex pattern is present in the string, whereas the original code fragment only checks if the pattern is present at the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns an array of all matches, whereas the original code fragment only checks if the pattern is present at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes('//')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the string contains the specified substring, whereas the original code fragment only checks if the pattern is present at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
