  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `nextStream` if `err` is `true`, but this new code fragment would call `nextStream` regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `err` as an argument to `nextStream`, but this new code fragment would pass `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `null` as an argument to `nextStream`, but this new code fragment would pass `stream` instead.

DONE.
