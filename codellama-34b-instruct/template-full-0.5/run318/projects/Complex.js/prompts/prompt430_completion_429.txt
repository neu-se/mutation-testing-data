  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` and `Math.round` both round up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.ceil`, `Math.round`, and `Math.floor` all round to the nearest integer.

DONE.
