  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a)` returns the value of `e^a - 1`, while `Math.expm1` returns the value of `e^a` minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.expm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * Math.expm1(b)` returns the value of `a` multiplied by the value of `e^b - 1`, while `Math.expm1(a)` returns the value of `e^a` minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a) * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a) * b` returns the value of `e^a - 1` multiplied by the value of `b`, while `Math.ex
