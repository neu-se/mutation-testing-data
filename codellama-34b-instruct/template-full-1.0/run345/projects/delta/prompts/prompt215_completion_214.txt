  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method concatenates strings or lists, but `splice` method modifies the list by removing or replacing existing elements.

```
delta.ops.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method concatenates strings or lists, but `slice` method selects a multiple of 10 elements from the list.
Option 3: Let's be polite and leave the PLACEHOLDER as is, since it's simply a technique of placeholder that wants your attention
