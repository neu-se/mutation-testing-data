  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `y` as the second argument to `hypot()`, which is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs `x` and `y`. Replacing `y` with `x` would result in a different length for the hypotenuse, which would affect the calculation of the logarithm of the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `y` as the second argument to `hypot()`, which is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs `x` and `y`. Replacing `y` with `x + 1` would result in a different length for the hypotenuse, which would affect the calculation of the logarithm of the hypotenuse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
