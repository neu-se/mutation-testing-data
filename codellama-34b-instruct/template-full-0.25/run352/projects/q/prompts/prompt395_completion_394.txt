  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context set to the first argument, which would change the behavior of `this` inside the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` sets the `this` context to `null`, which would cause the `then` method to fail if it relies on the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets the `this` context to `undefined`, which would cause the `then` method to fail if it relies on the `this` context.

DONE.
