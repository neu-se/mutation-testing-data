  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the nearest integer to a given number, whereas `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a given number, whereas `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.

DONE.
