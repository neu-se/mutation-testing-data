  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This environment was not anticipated by Q. Please file a bug.");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the environment is not anticipated by Q, while the new code fragment throws an error regardless of the environment.

DONE.
