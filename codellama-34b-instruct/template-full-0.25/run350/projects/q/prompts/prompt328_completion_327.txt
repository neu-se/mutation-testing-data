  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value, whereas `promise` is an object that contains the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `promise` is an object that contains the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, whereas `promise` is an object that contains the promise.

DONE.
