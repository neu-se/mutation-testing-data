  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the latitude value to be doubled, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 90 would cause the latitude value to be decreased by 90 degrees, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 180 would cause the latitude value to be increased by 180 degrees, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
