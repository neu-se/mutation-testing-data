  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` at the end of the code fragment would cause the generator to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a value to be executed later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call(null)` would cause the generator to be executed with a null context, rather than being passed as a value to be executed later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` would cause the generator to be executed with a null context, rather than being passed as a value to be executed later.

DONE.
