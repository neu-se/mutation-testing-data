  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point1Rad = deg2rad(point1.latitude + point2.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude values of the two points, effectively shifting the point of origin, producing a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point1Rad = deg2rad(point1.longitude + point2.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitude values of the two points, producing a different bearing, and ultimately, a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point1Rad = deg2rad(point1.longitude * point2.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a different mathematical operation on the two point's longitude and latitude values, producing a different output.

DONE.
