  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b` instead of the square of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the square of `a` instead of adding 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b` instead of the square of `a`.

DONE.
