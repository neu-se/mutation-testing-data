  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set would be incremented by 1, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the exact value to be set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set would be decremented by 1, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the exact value to be set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set would be doubled, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the exact value to be set.

DONE.
