  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would remove different characters from the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, ' ');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would replace the matched characters with a space instead of removing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, '');
```
This
