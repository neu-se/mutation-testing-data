 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the constructor form of the Promise, which behaves differently than the Q.join method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty array, which would not have the same properties and methods as the Q promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty function, which would not have the same properties and methods as the Q promise object.

DONE.
