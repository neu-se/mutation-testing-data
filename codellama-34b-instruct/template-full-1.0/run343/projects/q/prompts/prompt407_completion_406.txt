  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise(value)` checks if the value is a `Promise` object, while `typeof value === "object"` checks if the value is of type "object", which is not necessarily the same thing.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
value && typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise(value)` checks if the value is a `Promise` object, while `value && typeof value === "object"` checks if the value is both truthy and of type "object", which is not necessarily equivalent to just checking if the value is a `Promise` object.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise(value)` checks if the value is a `Promise` object, while `value instanceof Promise` checks if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class, which is not necessarily the same thing.
