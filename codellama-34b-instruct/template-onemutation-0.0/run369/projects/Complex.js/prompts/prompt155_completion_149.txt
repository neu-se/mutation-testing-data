  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()) && (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are zero or infinite, while the new code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is zero or infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` in more cases, which could lead to unexpected results in the application.

DONE.
