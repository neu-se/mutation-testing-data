 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would never be called if `end` is truthy, and the `read` function would not receive a callback with `end` set to true, potentially causing the `read` function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
