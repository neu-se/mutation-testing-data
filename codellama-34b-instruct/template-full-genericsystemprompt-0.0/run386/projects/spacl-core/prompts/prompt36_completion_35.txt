  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the resulting array to have a different length and content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method is called with an empty string as an argument, which would cause the resulting string to be concatenated without any separators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is called with a function that uppercases each element of the array, which would cause the resulting array to have different elements.

DONE.
