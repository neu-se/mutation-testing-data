  Sure, here are three options for mutating the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not being destructured, so the `deprecated` property would not be available on its own.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options['deprecated']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is being accessed using bracket notation instead of dot notation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is being added to the `options` object with a truthy value, but the original code only adds the `deprecated` property with a falsy value if the `options` object has a `deprecated` property.

DONE.
