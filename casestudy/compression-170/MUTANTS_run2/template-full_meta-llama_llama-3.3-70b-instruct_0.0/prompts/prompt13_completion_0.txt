Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHead(this.statusCode + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the HTTP status code sent in the response would be incremented by 1, potentially changing the interpretation of the response by the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.writeHead
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeHead` method would be called on the `res` object directly, rather than on the `this` context, which could lead to differences in how the method is bound and executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.write
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` method would be called instead of `writeHead`, potentially sending response body data instead of response headers, leading to a malformed response.

DONE.
