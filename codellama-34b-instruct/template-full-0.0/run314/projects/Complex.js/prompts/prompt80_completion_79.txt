  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'+'`, while this replacement checks if `c` is not equal to `'+'`. This would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'+'`, while this replacement checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`. This would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'+'`, while this replacement checks if `c` is equal to `'*'`. This would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
