  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(' ').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of words, and then join them back together into a single string with no spaces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(/\s+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of words using a regular expression, rather than a fixed string.

DONE.
