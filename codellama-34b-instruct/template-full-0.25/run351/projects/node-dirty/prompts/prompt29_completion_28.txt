  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key from the map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value associated with a key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that adds or updates a key-value pair in the map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value associated with a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a property that returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value associated with a key.

DONE.
