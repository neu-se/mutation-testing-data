  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice` to extract a slice of an array, while the buggy code fragment uses `array_slice` to extract a slice of a promise. This could cause the test to fail if the promise is not resolved yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_reduce` to reduce an array to a single value, while the buggy code fragment uses `array_reduce` to reduce a promise to a single value. This could cause the test to fail if the promise is not resolved yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_map` to map an array to a new array, while the buggy code fragment uses `array_map` to map a promise to a new promise. This could cause the
