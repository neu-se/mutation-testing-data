  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, "extra argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled and rejected callbacks would receive an additional argument, which would cause them to fail if they were not designed to handle it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled and rejected callbacks would be swapped, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled and rejected callbacks would be null, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of null instead of the expected value.

DONE.
