  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are swapped, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
