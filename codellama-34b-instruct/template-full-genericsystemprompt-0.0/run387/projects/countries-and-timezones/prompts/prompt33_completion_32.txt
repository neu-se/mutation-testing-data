  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset string would be one minute ahead of the actual offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset string would be one minute behind the actual offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset string would always be positive, even if the actual offset is negative.

DONE.
