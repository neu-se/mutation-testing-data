  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return `other`, regardless of the contents of `this` and `other`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return `this`, regardless of the contents of `this` and `other`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return `other`, regardless of the contents of `this` and `other`.

DONE.
