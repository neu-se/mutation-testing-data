  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it accesses the `state` property of the `inspect` method, which is not a valid property. This will cause an error when the `isRejected` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This code fragment calls the `inspect` method with the `this` context, which is not a valid use of the `call` method. This will cause an error when the `isRejected` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This code fragment creates a new function that is bound to the `this` context, which is not a valid use of the `bind` method. This will cause an error when the `isRejected` method is called.

DONE.
