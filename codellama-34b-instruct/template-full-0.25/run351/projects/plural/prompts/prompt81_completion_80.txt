  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "geese" as the plural form of "goose", while this code fragment uses "gooses" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "geese" as the plural form of "goose", while this code fragment uses "gese" instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "geese" as the plural form of "goose", while this code fragment uses "goose" instead.

DONE.
