  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `global.Q` to `previousQ`, which is not the same as assigning the value of `global.Q` to `global.Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q.noConflict();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `global.Q.noConflict()` to `previousQ`, which is not the same as assigning the value of `global.Q` to `previousQ`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q.noConflict();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `global.Q.noConflict()` to `previousQ`, which is not the same as assigning the value of `global.Q` to `previousQ`.

DONE.
