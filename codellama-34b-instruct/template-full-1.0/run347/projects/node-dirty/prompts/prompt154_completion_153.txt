  Option 1:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the
`PLACEHOLDER` parameter and would always uncork the write stream with a value of 1,
regardless of the number of in-flight writes.

Option 2:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._inFlightWrites - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the
`_inFlightWrites` counter before uncorking the write stream, which could
potentially cause the write stream to be uncorked too soon, resulting in data
loss or corruption.

Option 3:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._inFlightWrites * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the
`_inFlightWrites` counter before uncorking the write stream, which could
potentially cause the write stream to be uncork
