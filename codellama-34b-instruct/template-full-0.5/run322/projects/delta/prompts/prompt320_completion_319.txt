  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different property than `op.retain`, and it would change the behavior of the `retain` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different property than `op.retain`, and it would change the behavior of the `retain` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different property than `op.retain`, and it would change the behavior of the `retain` method.

DONE.
