  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseurl` property is not being considered in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not being considered in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property is not being considered in the original code fragment.

DONE.
