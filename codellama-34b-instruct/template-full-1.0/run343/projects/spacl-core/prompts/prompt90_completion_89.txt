  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `const policy` is accessing the first element of the `policies` array, but the replacement code fragment `policies[0]` is accessing the 0th index of the `policies` array, which may not be the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `const policy` is accessing the `policy` field of the `PolicyMap` class, but the replacement code fragment `policy.name` is accessing the `name` field of the `policy` object, which may not be the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `const policy` is accessing the `policy` field of the `PolicyMap` class, but the replacement code fragment `this.get(name)`
