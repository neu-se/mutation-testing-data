  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:giraffe|human|rat|alligator|skunk)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:pizza|cake|chocolate|ice cream|sushi)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different set of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:car|truck|bus|train|boat)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different set of words.

DONE.
