Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandlerWrong
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent function, which would cause a runtime error instead of correctly retrieving the handler for the embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType + 'Wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a handler with an incorrect name, which may not exist, leading to undefined behavior or errors when trying to use the handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `thisData` instead of `embedType`, which would likely lead to an incorrect handler being retrieved or an error if `thisData` is not a valid embed type.

DONE.
