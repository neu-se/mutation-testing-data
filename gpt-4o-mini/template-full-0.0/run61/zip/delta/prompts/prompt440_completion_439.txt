Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.insert` is a number instead of a string, which would lead to the `insert` property being incorrectly assigned or omitted in the returned operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.insert` is strictly equal to `null`, which would cause the code to skip the assignment of the `insert` property entirely if `nextOp.insert` is not `null`, even if it is a valid string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.insert` is not a string, which would lead to the `insert` property being assigned incorrectly or not at all, even when `nextOp.insert` is a valid string.

DONE.
