  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the strict equality operator, whereas this replacement uses the inequality operator. This would cause the `forEach` method to behave differently when a `key` is present in the `_data` map, but the `val` associated with that `key` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `val` is truthy or falsy, whereas this replacement checks whether `val` is `null` or `undefined`. This would cause the `forEach` method to behave differently when a `key` is present in the `_data` map, but the `val` associated with that `key` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `val` is strictly equal
