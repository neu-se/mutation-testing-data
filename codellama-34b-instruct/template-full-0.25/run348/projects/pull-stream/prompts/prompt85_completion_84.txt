  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter, while this replacement uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) which would result in a different behavior if `cb` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter, while this replacement uses the ternary operator (`?:`) which would result in a different behavior if `cb` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function () { throw new Error('cb is required') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter, while this replacement uses the logical OR
