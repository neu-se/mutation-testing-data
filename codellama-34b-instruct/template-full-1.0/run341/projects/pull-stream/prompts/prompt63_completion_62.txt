  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```end = !end```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always treat `end` as `false`, even if it is a truthy value. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs where `end` is a truthy value but not `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```end = abort```
This would result in different behavior because the code would treat `abort` as the value of `end`, even if `end` is already a truthy value. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs where `abort` is a truthy value but `end` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```end = end || !abort```
This would result in different behavior because the code would treat `end` as the value of `end` if it is already a truthy value, but would treat `!abort` as the value of `end` if `end` is falsy and `abort` is
