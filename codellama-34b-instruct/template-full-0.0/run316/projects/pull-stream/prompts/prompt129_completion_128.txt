  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments. This could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior or cause it to fail if it is not designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with the value of `i` as its first argument, while this new code fragment calls it with the value of `i` as its second argument. This could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior or cause it to fail if it is not designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with the value of `i` as its first argument, while this
