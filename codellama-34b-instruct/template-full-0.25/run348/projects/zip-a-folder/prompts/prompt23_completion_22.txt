  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create()
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create()` creates a new archiver instance, while `archiver` is a reference to the existing instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create('zip')
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create('zip')` creates a new archiver instance with the format set to 'zip', while `archiver` is a reference to the existing instance with the format set to 'tar'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create('tar')
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create('tar')` creates a new archiver instance with the format set to 'tar', while `archiver` is a reference to the existing instance with the format set to 'zip'.

DONE.
