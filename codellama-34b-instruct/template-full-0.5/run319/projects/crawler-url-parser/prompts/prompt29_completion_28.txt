  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first character of the `currentUrlStr` instead of the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last character of the `currentUrlStr` instead of the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://" + currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prepend "http://" to the `currentUrlStr`, regardless of whether it already starts with "http://" or not.

DONE.
