  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and `data` is truthy. If `data` is falsy, the original code would return `end`, while this new code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy or `data` is truthy. If `data` is truthy, the original code would return `end`, while this new code would return `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is not equal to `data`.
