  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `null` is not an object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `undefined` is not an object and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object and would cause a different behavior in the `JSON.parse` method.

DONE.
