  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is different from `x + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is different from `x - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is different from `x * 2`.

DONE.
