  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the value of `arg` by 1, whereas the original code fragment leaves the value of `arg` unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `arg` by 2, whereas the original code fragment leaves the value of `arg` unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the value of `arg` by 1, whereas the original code fragment leaves the value of `arg` unchanged.

DONE.
