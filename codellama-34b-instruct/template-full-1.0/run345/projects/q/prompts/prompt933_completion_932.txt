  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(13, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `13` is not a function and does not have a `ninvoke()` method, so the code would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(void 0, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`, so the call to `ninvoke()` would return `undefined`, which is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(Q, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that returns a new promise, so the call to `ninvoke()` would return a new promise, which is not the same as the original promise.

DONE.
