  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This change will cause the `clone()` method to be called on the `ctx` object, which may have unintended consequences if the `clone()` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.deepClone()
```
This change will cause the `deepClone()` method to be called on the `ctx` object, which may have unintended consequences if the `deepClone()` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone(true)
```
This change will cause the `clone()` method to be called on the `ctx` object with the `deep` parameter set to `true`, which may have unintended consequences if the `clone()` method is not implemented correctly.

DONE.
