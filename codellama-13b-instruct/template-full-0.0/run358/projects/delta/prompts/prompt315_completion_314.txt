  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `retain` operation to retain one more character than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `retain` operation to retain one fewer character than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` would cause the `retain` operation to retain twice as many characters as the original code.

DONE.
