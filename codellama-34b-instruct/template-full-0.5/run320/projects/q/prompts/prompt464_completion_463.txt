  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `at` index of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the same as accessing the `at` index of the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `at` index of the `unhandledReasons` array, which is not the same as accessing the `at` index of the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `reason` value to the `process.emit()` function, which is not the same as passing the `promise` value.

DONE.
