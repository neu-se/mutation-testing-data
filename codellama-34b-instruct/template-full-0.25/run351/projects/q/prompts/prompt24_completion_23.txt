  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the program to crash, whereas the original code fragment would simply log an error message to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a different message to the console, whereas the original code fragment would log a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log an error message to the console, whereas the original code fragment would log a different message.

DONE.
