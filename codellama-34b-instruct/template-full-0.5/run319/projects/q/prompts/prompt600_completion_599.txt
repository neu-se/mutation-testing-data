  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` are not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array, so `args + 1` would return a new array with the value `1` appended to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `args` array, so the code would pass a different value to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
