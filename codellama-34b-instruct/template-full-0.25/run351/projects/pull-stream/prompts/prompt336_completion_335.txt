  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` argument to the callback function, while `end, null` passes `null` instead. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to a test failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` argument to the callback function, while `end, undefined` passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to a test failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` argument to the callback function, while `end, "foo"` passes the string `"foo"` instead. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to a test failure.
