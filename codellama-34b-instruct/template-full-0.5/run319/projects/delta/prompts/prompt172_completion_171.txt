  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other Delta, rather than the length of the current operation in the this Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the this Delta plus one, which could result in the algorithm skipping over a portion of the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the minimum of the lengths of the current operations in the this and other Deltas, which could result in the algorithm not correctly identifying the length of the next operation in the other Delta.

DONE.
