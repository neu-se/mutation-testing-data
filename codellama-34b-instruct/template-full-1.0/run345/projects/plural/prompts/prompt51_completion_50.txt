  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ie' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "ies" is added to the word, whereas the original code adds "es" to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'SE' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "SE" is added to the word in all capital letters, whereas the original code adds "es" to the word in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' + w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "es" is added to the word and then the word is added again to the end of the string, whereas the original code adds "es" to the word only once.

DONE.
