  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `nodeback` function, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to the `nodeback` function, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument and `error` as the second argument to the `nodeback` function, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
