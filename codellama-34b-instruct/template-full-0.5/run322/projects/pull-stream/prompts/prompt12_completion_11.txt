  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the function to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition would always be false.

DONE.
