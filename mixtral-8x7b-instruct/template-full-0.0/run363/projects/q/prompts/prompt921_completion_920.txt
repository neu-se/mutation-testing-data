 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply(null, nodeArgs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)` which ensures that the callback function is executed as a promise, while the suggested change directly applies the callback function with given arguments, bypassing the promise mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(callback.apply(null, nodeArgs)).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the suggested change wraps the result of the callback application with `Q.when()` which converts the result into a promise, but it does not handle errors in the same way as the original code. The original code uses `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)` which automatically handles errors and passes them to the fail handler, while the suggested change relies on the error being passed to the fail handler through the rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
