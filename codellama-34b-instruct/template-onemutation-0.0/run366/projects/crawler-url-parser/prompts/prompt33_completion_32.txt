  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present in the URL, while the new code fragment replaces the protocol with "https://" regardless of whether it is already present or not.
