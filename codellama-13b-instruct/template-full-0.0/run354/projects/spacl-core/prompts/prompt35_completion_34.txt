  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method is used to remove the first element of the array, which is not the desired behavior. The correct behavior is to remove the last element of the array, which can be achieved by using `slice(-1)` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(-1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(-1)` method is used to remove the last element of the array, which is not the desired behavior. The correct behavior is to remove the first element of the array, which can be achieved by using `slice(1)` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1, -1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1, -1)` method is used to remove
