  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function and has a length of 1, while the mutated code fragment only checks if `a` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function and has a length of 1, while the mutated code fragment checks if `a` is a function but has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function and has a length of 1, while the mutated code fragment checks if `a` is a string.

DONE.
