  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only advances the iterator by one step, while this modified code fragment advances it by two steps.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment advances the iterator by the full length of the current operation, while this modified code fragment advances it by one less than the full length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment advances the iterator by the full length of the current operation, while this modified code fragment advances it by one more than the full length.

DONE.
