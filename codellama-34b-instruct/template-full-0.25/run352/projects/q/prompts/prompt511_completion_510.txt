  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of the `args` array and any additional arguments passed to the function, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.map()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array that is the result of applying a function to each element of the `args` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
