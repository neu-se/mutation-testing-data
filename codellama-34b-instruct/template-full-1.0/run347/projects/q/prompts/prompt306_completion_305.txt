  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the `answerPs` array would never be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < len + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra unnecessary iteration would be performed.

DONE.
