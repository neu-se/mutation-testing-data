  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_reduce` function would start iterating from the second element instead of the first, which could cause the function to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_reduce` function would start iterating from the second-to-last element instead of the last, which could cause the function to skip the last element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_reduce` function would start iterating from the doubled index instead of the original index, which could cause the function to skip elements in the array.

DONE.
