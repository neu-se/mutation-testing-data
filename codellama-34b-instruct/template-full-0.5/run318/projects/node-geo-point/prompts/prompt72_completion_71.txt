  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.NaN` is a special value that represents "not a number" and is different from the original code fragment `Number`, which represents the number type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a different type than `Number` and would cause the code to behave differently when dealing with string values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that represents "no value" and is different from the original code fragment `Number`, which represents a numerical value.

DONE.
