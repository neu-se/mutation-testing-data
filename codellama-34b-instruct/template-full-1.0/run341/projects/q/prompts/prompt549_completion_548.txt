  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.isDone()
```
This would result in different behavior because `generator.isDone()` is a method that checks if the generator is done executing, while `result.done` is a boolean value that indicates whether the promise returned by `async` is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.isPending()` checks if the promise is still pending, while `result.done` checks if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.isFulfilled()` checks if the promise is fulfilled, while `result.done` checks if the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
