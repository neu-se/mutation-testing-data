Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `baseArgs` array, rather than concatenating it with the new arguments, which would lead to the loss of the original arguments when calling the bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `array_slice(arguments, 0)` would create a new array containing all arguments passed to the function, rather than just the arguments that were intended to be concatenated with `baseArgs`, potentially leading to incorrect argument handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because appending `[null]` to the `baseArgs` array would alter the expected arguments passed to the callback function, potentially causing unexpected results or errors when the function is invoked.

DONE.
