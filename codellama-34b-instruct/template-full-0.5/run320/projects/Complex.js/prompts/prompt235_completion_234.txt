  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` is the cube root function, whereas `Math.sqrt` is the square root function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is the power function, whereas `Math.sqrt` is the square root function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is the exponential function, whereas `Math.sqrt` is the square root function.

DONE.
