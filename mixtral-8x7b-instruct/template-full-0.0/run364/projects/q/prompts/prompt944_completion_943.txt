 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called without passing the `Q` object as the first argument, which is required to create a new deferred object. This would cause the `deferred.promise` to be undefined, leading to unexpected behavior in the `Q.nbind` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with `true` as the first argument, instead of a `Q` object. This would cause the `deferred.promise` to be undefined, leading to unexpected behavior in the `Q.nbind` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with an empty function as the first argument, instead of a `Q` object. This would cause
