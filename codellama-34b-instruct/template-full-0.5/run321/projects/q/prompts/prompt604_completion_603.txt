  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that would reject the promise with an error, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that would reject the promise with an error, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(undefined)` would resolve the promise with an undefined value, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with a value.

DONE.
