  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the value was truthy, and replacing it with null would make the check fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the value was truthy, and replacing it with undefined would also make the check fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the value was truthy, and replacing it with false would make the check fail.

DONE.
