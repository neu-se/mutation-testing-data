  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this new code fragment logs the value of `data + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this new code fragment logs the length of `data`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this new code fragment logs the first element of `data`, which is a different value.

DONE.
