Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `length` variable instead of `opLength`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the number of operations to process, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the delta operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the length returned by `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could cause the code to attempt to process one more operation than available, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces `opLength` by 1, ensuring that at least 0 is returned. This could lead to skipping an operation or incorrectly processing fewer operations than intended.

DONE.
