  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset !== 0
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to return a different result when the `offset` property is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to return a different result when the `offset` property is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset >= 0
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to return a different result when the `offset` property is greater than or equal to 0.

DONE.
