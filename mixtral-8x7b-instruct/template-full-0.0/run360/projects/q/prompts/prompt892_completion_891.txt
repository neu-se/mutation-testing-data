 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would immediately resolve the promise instead of waiting for the Node.js callback to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Buggy replacement'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would immediately reject the promise with an error, instead of waiting for the Node.js callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function would replace the Node.js callback with an empty function, which would prevent the Node.js function from being called.

DONE.
