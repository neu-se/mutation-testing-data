  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve(value)` would resolve the promise with the value `value`, whereas `defer` is a promise that is already resolved with the value `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject(value)` would reject the promise with the value `value`, whereas `defer` is a promise that is already resolved with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify(value)` would notify the promise with the value `value`, whereas `defer` is a promise that is already resolved with the value `value`.

DONE.
