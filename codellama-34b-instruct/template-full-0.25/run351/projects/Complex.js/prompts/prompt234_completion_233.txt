  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the greater than or equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently for values of `a` that are equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the not equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently for values of `a` that are equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the greater than operator. This would cause the code to behave differently for values of `b` that are equal to zero.

DONE.
