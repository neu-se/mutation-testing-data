  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if the object has a different type, length, or attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(embedType in otherData);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the presence of the embed type in the other data, not the actual data or attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (embedType in otherData) && otherData[embedType] !== thisData[embedType];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider both the presence and the value of the embed type in the other data, but not the attributes.

DONE.
