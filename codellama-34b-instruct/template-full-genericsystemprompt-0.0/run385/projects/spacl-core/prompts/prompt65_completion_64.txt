  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first rule in the array, potentially changing the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the rules in the array, potentially changing the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.filter((rule) => rule.query(path, verb, ctx) === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add rules to the policy if they explicitly allow the action, potentially changing the outcome of the `query` method.

DONE.
