  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be 0, leading to division by 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be 0, leading to division by 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be 0, leading to division by 0.

DONE.
