  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.promiseDispatch` is not a function, it is a property that holds a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.resolve` is not a function, it is a property that holds a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.reject` is not a function, it is a property that holds a promise.

DONE.
