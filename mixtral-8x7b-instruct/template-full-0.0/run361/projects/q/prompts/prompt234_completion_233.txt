 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `resolvedPromise` in a new promise, which might not be expected by the code that uses this deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(null)
