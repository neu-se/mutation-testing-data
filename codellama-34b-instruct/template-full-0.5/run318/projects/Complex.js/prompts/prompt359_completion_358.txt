  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `tanh()` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const pi = Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because `pi` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and using it in place of `Math.cos()` would cause the `tanh()` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` and `Math.cos()` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `tanh()` function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
