 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks if the difference in part count is greater than 0, instead of equal to 1. This means that any link with more parts than the base URL will be considered as "sublevel", even if the base URL is not included in the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part_count_diff >= 1
