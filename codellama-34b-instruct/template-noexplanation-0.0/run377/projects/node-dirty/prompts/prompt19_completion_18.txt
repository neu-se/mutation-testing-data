  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.slice()
```
This will create a new array containing the same elements as `cbs`, which can be used to store the callbacks for a given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.concat()
```
This will create a new array containing the elements of `cbs` followed by the elements of `key`, which can be used to store the callbacks for a given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.map(cb => cb)
```
This will create a new array containing the results of calling the `cb` function for each element in `cbs`, which can be used to store the callbacks for a given key.

DONE.
