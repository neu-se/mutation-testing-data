  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the baseOp into the inverted delta, while this code fragment deletes the baseOp from the inverted delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the baseOp into the inverted delta, while this code fragment retains the baseOp in the inverted delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(baseOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the baseOp from the inverted delta, while this code fragment pushes the baseOp into the inverted delta.

DONE.
