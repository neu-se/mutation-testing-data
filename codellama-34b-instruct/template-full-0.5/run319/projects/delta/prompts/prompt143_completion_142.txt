  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 would cause the next operation to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation, and adding 1 would cause the next operation to be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation, and multiplying by 2 would cause the next operation to be included twice.

DONE.
