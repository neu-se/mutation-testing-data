  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```let currentUrl = urlMap.get(currentUrl.url);```
This would result in an infinite loop because the value of `currentUrl` is being reassigned inside the loop, causing the loop to never end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```let currentUrl = urlMap.values().next().value```
This would result in the loop only running once because the first value of the `urlMap` is being retrieved and assigned to `currentUrl`, making the loop condition always false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```let currentUrl = urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url)```
This would result in an error because `delete` returns `undefined` and `undefined` does not have a `url` property.

DONE.
