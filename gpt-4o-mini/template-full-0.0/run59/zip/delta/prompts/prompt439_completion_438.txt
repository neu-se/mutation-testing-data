Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is a string instead of checking if it is an object and not null, which would lead to incorrect handling of the `retain` property when it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is strictly `undefined`, which would bypass the original check for an object type and could lead to unexpected results when `retain` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number' && nextOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is a positive number, which would incorrectly filter out valid object types and could lead to incorrect processing of operations that should be retained.

DONE.
