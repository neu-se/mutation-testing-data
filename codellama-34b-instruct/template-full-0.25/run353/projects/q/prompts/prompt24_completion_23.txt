  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error every time the code is executed, whereas the original code only throws an error if `domain` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `domain` variable to null, whereas the original code leaves it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `domain` variable to undefined, whereas the original code leaves it unchanged.

DONE.
