  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to be a number, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> && 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to be a number, and it would also cause the code to behave differently if the value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> != 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to be a boolean, and it would also cause the code to behave differently if the value is not a boolean.

DONE.
