  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` always returns a resolved promise, whereas the original code fragment `Q.race()` returns a rejected promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race(undefined)` will throw an error, whereas the original code fragment `Q.race()` will return a rejected promise if the argument is not a promise or an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(undefined)` will return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment `Q.race()` will return a rejected promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected.
