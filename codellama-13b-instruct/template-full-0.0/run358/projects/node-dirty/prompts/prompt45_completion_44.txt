  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.get(key)` expression would be evaluated before the `updater` function is called, causing the `updater` function to receive the original value of the key, rather than the updated value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the original value of the key, rather than the updated value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the original value of the key, rather than the updated value.

DONE.
