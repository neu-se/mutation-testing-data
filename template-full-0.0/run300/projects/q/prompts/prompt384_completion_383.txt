  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will always reject the promise, whereas `thenResolve` will always resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not called with the correct `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function() { return value; }, function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not called with the correct `this` value, and the `then` method is called with two arguments instead of one.

DONE.
