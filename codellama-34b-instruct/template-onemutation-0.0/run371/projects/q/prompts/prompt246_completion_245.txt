  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks` variables, which would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to a non-empty string even if long stack support is disabled or the stack trace is not available.

DONE.
