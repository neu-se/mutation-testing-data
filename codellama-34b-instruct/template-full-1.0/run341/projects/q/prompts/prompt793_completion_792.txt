  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["catch"](function () {
    return object;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `catch` method. Instead of returning a rejected promise, it returns the original promise, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).tap(function () {
    throw new Error("Error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `tap` method to the promise, which throws an error when called. This could cause the promise to be rejected unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["catch"](function () {
    return "Error";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `catch` method. Instead of returning a rejected promise, it returns a resolved promise with the value "Error", potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
