  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file` variable is now converted to uppercase, which could cause issues if the file name is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file` variable is now converted to lowercase, which could cause issues if the file name is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace(/ /g, '_')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file` variable is now modified to replace all spaces with underscores, which could cause issues if the file name contains spaces.

DONE.
