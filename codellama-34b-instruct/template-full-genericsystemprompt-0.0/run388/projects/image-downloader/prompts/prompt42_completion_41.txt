  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `TimeoutError` class is not being used, and the error message is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.', { code: 'ETIMEDOUT' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `TimeoutError` class is not being used, and the error message is different. Additionally, the `code` property is being set to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.', { code: 'ETIMEDOUT', timeout: 1000 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `TimeoutError` class is not being used, and the error message is different. Additionally, the `timeout` property is being set to a different value.

DONE.
