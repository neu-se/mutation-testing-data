  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `rule` object, rather than a deep copy, which could cause issues if the `rule` object has nested properties or methods that are used in the `Policy` class.
