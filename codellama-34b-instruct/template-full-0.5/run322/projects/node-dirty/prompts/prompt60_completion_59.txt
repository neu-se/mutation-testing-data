  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is not a readable stream, so it would not have a `data` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a Map object and does not have a `on` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object and does not have a `on` method.

DONE.
