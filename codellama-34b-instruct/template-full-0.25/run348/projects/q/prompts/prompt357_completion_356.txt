  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, and passing `null` would result in a different error message being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, and passing `undefined` would result in a different error message being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, and passing a custom error message would result in a different error message being thrown.

DONE.
