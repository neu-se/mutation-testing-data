  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero, but the replaced code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero, but the replaced code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()
