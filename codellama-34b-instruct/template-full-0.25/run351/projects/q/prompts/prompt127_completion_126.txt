  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, which could lead to unexpected results if the code is executed in a different context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object in a browser environment, and accessing properties on it could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `global` is a global object in a Node.js environment, and accessing properties on it could have unintended consequences.

DONE.
