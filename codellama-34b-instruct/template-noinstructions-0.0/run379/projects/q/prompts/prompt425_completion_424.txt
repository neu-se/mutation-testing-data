  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.state` is a property that is not defined. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `state` property of a non-existent object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect()` is a function that returns a promise, and `this.inspect().state` is a property that is not defined. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `state` property of a non-existent object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.fulfilled` is a property that is not
