  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) + Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `φ2` variable, which would cause the `calculateBearing` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `calculateBearing` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point2.latitude) - Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is subtracted from the `φ2` variable, which would cause the `calculateBearing` function to return a different value.

DONE.
