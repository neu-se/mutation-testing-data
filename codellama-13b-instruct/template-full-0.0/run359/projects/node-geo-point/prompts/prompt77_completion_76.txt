  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be incremented by 1, which would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by a small amount in the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be decremented by 1, which would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by a small amount in the opposite direction of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by a larger amount in the direction of the bearing.

DONE.
