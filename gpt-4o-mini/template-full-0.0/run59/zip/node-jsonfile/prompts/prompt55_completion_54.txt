Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null, spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the replacer will cause `JSON.stringify` to ignore any custom replacer function, potentially leading to different output compared to the original code where the actual `replacer` is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the `spaces` argument to `JSON.stringify` will result in a compact JSON string without any indentation, whereas the original code allows for custom spacing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because using a fixed integer (like `2`) for the `spaces` argument will always format the JSON output with 2 spaces for indentation, regardless of any custom spacing that might have been intended by the original code.

DONE.
