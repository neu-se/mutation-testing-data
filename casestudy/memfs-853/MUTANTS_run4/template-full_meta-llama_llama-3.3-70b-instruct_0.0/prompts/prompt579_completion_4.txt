Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
link.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would contain the resolved path of the link instead of the original filename, potentially leading to confusion when debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
steps.join(sep)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would contain the path components joined by the separator, which might not be the same as the original filename if the path is absolute or relative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename + ' does not exist'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would contain additional text, potentially making it harder to identify the actual error cause, and might not be correctly handled by error parsing code that expects a specific format.

DONE.
