Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the magnitude `r` instead of the angle `phi`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the angle `phi`, which would distort the angle used in the trigonometric calculations, resulting in an incorrect representation of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the angle `phi` with a constant value of Ï€/2, which would yield a fixed imaginary component and ignore the actual angle provided, leading to incorrect results for the complex number.

DONE.
