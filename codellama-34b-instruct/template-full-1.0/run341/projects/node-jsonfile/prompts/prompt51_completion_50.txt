  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
javascript:console.log("Hello, world!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a statement that called the JSON.stringify function, whereas the replacement code fragment is a statement that logs a message to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
javascript:stringify(obj, { replacer: function(key, value) { return typeof value === 'number' ? value * 2 : value } })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not specify a replacer function, whereas the replacement code fragment specifies a replacer function that modifies the original value by multiplying it by 2 if it is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
javascript:stringify(obj, { spaces: 4 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not specify the number of spaces to indent nested objects, whereas the replacement code fragment specifies 4 spaces for indentation.
