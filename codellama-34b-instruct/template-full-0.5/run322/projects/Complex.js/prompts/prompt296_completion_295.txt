  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `a` is the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not the same as `a` and would result in a different value for the `sin` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is not the same as `a` and would result in a different value for the `sin` function.

DONE.
