  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(throw new Error("Something went wrong!"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an error to the `next` function, causing the generator to throw an error instead of continuing execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a boolean value to the `next` function, causing the generator to receive a value of `false` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a `null` value to the `next` function, causing the generator to receive a `null` value instead of the expected value.

DONE.
