  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the product.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the sum.

DONE.
