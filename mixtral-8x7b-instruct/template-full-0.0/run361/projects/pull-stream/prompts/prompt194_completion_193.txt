 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not waiting for the async operation to complete or handle any errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with a null error, even if the read operation or the map function encounters an error. This could hide potential issues in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Skipping callback')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the callback, leaving the async operation unresolved. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the application, especially if the async operation is responsible for releasing resources or updating the application state.

DONE.
