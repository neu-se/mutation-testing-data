  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` is a function and `drain(null, done)` will call the `drain` function with `null` as an argument, whereas the original code fragment `drain` will simply return a reference to the `drain` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` is a function and `drain(done, null)` will call the `drain` function with `done` and `null` as arguments, whereas the original code fragment `drain` will simply return a reference to the `drain` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function and `done()` will call the `done` function, whereas the original code fragment `drain` will simply return a reference to the
