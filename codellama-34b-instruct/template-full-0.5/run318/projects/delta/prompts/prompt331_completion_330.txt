  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the insert operation, rather than the length of the entire operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of characters to retain, rather than the length of the entire operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of characters to delete, rather than the length of the entire operation.

DONE.
