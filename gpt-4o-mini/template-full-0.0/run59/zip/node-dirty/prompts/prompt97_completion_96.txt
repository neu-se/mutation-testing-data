Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('warning', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'warning' event instead of an 'error' event, which may not be handled by the same listeners and could lead to unreported issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`), 'additional info');
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument ('additional info') to the emitted error event, which may cause listeners expecting a different number of arguments to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`), null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an error with a null second argument, which could lead to confusion or errors in event listeners that expect a specific type or value for that argument.

DONE.
