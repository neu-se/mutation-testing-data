  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `tap` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the original value.

DONE.
