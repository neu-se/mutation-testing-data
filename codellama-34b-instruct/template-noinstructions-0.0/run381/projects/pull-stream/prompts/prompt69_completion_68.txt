  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr = new Error('no done callback supplied')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `done` callback is not supplied, while this new code fragment throws an error regardless of whether the `done` callback is supplied or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr = new Error('no done callback supplied')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `done` callback is not supplied, while this new code fragment throws an error regardless of whether the `done` callback is supplied or not.
