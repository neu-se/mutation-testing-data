  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` is a function that creates a fulfilled promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a function that decorates a generator function, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a promise.

DONE.
