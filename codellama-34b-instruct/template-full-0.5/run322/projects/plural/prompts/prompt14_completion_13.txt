  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the length of the word minus 1 as the starting point for the substring, while the new code uses the length of the word minus 2. This would cause the function to return the wrong substring for words that end with "y" and have more than one letter before the "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the length of the word minus 1 as the starting point for the substring, while the new code uses the length of the word minus 2. This would cause the function to return the wrong substring for words that end with "y" and have more than one letter before the "y".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the length of the word minus 1 as the starting point for the substring, while the new code uses the
