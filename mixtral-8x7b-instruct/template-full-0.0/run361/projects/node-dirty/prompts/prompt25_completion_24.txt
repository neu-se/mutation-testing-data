 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function might not be called, causing the callback queue to not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because an integer value would be passed to the `setImmediate` function, which expects a callback function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed to the `setImmediate` function, which would not execute the intended callback function `cb`.

DONE.
