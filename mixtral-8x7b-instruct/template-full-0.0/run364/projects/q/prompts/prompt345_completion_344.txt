 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(<exception>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected with a new exception instead of propagating the original one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be `null` instead of a rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('This is a new error')
