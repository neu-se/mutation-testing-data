  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the precision of the latitude and longitude values by 1, which could potentially cause issues with the calculations and the resulting coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the precision of the latitude and longitude values by 1, which could potentially cause issues with the calculations and the resulting coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the precision of the latitude and longitude values, which could potentially cause issues with the calculations and the resulting coordinates.

DONE.
