  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isEqual` function, so the resulting `attributes` object would contain all keys that are not equal between `a` and `b`, rather than just the keys that are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isEqual` function is called with the wrong arguments. The `a[key]` and `b[key]` arguments should be swapped, so that the function is called with the correct values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(b[key], a[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is called with the arguments in the wrong order. The function should be called with the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` in the correct order.
