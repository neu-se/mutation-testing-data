  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the next character in the slice, potentially causing the code to access an index outside the bounds of the base string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last character in the slice, potentially causing the code to miss a necessary character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice one character later, potentially causing the code to access an index outside the bounds of the base string.

DONE.
