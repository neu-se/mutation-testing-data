  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it would have returned with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return a different result than what it would have returned with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `test` function, which is not the same as the result of the `test` function. This would cause the `filter` function to return a different result than what it would have returned with the original code fragment.

DONE.
