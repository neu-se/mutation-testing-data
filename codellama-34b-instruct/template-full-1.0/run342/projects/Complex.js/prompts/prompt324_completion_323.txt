  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2a
```
This would result in different behavior because `2a` is not equal to `a`, and would produce a different result in the final calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not equal to `a`, and would produce a different result in the final calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is not equal to `a`, and would produce a different result in the final calculation.

DONE.
