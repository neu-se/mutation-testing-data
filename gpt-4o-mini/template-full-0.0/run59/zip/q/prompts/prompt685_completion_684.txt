Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the arguments to the `apply` method, causing the function to be called without any arguments instead of the original arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the arguments to the `apply` method, which is not the same as passing the original arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results in the function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unexpected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string "unexpected" as the arguments to the `apply` method, which would not match the expected argument types and could lead to errors or incorrect behavior in the invoked function.

DONE.
