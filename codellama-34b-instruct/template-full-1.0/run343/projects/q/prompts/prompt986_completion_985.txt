  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different method than "post" and would likely cause an error when called on an object that does not have a "get" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"concat"
```
This would result in different behavior because "concat" is a different method than "post" and would likely cause an error when called on an object that does not have a "concat" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because "dispatch" is a different method than "post" and would likely cause an error when called on an object that does not have a "dispatch" method.

DONE.
