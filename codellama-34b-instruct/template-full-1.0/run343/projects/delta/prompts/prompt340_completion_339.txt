  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first element in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start at the second element in the slice rather than the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra element in the slice.

DONE.
