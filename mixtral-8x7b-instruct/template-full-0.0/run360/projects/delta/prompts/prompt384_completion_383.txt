 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it advances the iterator and returns the length of the next operation, rather than getting the length of the peeked operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek().length
