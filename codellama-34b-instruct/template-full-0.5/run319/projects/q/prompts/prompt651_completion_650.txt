  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid operation for a promise. The code would likely throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a valid operation for a promise, but it would not make sense in this context. The code would likely throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolve" is a valid operation for a promise, but it would not make sense in this context. The code would likely throw an error or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
