  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object would have a different value property, which could affect the logic of the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object would have a null value property, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value2': true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object would have a different property, which could affect the logic of the code that uses it.

DONE.
