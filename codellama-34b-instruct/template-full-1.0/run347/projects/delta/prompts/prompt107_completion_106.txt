  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` always executes the provided function once for each element present in the array, whereas `map` may or may not execute the callback function on each element, depending on whether the element is present in the array or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` may or may not execute the callback function on each element, depending on whether the element is present in the array or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` may or may not execute the callback function on each element, depending on whether the element is present in the array or not.

DONE.
