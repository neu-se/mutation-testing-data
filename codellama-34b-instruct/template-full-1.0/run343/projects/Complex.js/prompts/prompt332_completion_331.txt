  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b > 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this code fragment checks for greater than. This could cause the function to return a different value for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b != 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this code fragment checks for inequality. This could cause the function to return a different value for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b !== 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this code fragment checks for strict equality. This could cause the function to return a different value for certain input values.

DONE.
