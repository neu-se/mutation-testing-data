  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of [key, value] pairs from an object, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` return arrays of a single type (keys or values, respectively).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.fromEntries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.fromEntries` creates a new object from an array of [key, value] pairs, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` simply return arrays of keys or values, respectively.

DONE.
