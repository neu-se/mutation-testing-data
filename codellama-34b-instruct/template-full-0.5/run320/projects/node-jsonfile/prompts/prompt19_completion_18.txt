  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + file
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `file` variable, so the expression would be evaluated as `1 + file` instead of `file`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `file` variable, so the expression would be evaluated as `file + 1` instead of `file`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `file` variable instead of the `file` variable itself.

DONE.
