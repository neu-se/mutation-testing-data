Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the original `args` would cause the dispatch method to receive no arguments for the operation, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior when the method is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `args` would mean that the dispatch method would not receive the expected arguments, which could lead to the operation being executed without the necessary parameters, resulting in incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of the original `args` would mean that the dispatch method is called with no arguments, which could lead to the operation being executed without any of the intended parameters, potentially causing it to fail or behave incorrectly.

DONE.
