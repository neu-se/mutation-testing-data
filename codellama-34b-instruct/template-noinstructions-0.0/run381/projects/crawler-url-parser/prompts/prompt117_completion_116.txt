  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"internal"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would always return "internal", regardless of the actual relationship between the link URL and the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"external"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would always return "external", regardless of the actual relationship between the link URL and the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"uplevel"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would always return "uplevel", regardless of the actual relationship between the link URL and the page URL.

DONE.
