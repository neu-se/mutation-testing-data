  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.length` property is not a promise, and would not cause the `spread` method to wait for the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(args.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(args.length)` expression is a promise that resolves to the value of `args.length`, and would cause the `spread` method to wait for the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args[0]` expression is the first element of the `args` array, and would not cause the `spread` method to wait for the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
