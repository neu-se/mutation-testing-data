  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a `null` value instead of an `id`, which could cause it to return a different country object or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive an `undefined` value instead of an `id`, which could cause it to return a different country object or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a string value instead of an `id`, which could cause it to return a different country object or throw an error.

DONE.
