  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called more frequently, potentially leading to incorrect parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called less frequently, potentially leading to incorrect parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called only when the `plus` and `minus` variables have the same value, potentially leading to incorrect parsing results.

DONE.
