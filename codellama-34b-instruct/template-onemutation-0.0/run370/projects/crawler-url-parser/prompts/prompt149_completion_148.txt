  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 0
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings, while the new code fragment uses the `filter` method to filter the array of substrings and return only the elements that have a length greater than 0. The `filter` method will not work correctly if the `pageurl_path` string is not already an array of substrings.
