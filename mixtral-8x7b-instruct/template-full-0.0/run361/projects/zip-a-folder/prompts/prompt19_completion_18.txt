 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `W_OK` check for write permission is missing, which might cause issues when trying to write the output file in the specified target base path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `R_OK` check for read permission is missing, which might cause issues when trying to access the source directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
path.dirname(targetFilePath), fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is replaced with `path.dirname(targetFilePath)`. This change would cause a permission check for the target base path instead of the source directory, which might not be desired.

DONE.
