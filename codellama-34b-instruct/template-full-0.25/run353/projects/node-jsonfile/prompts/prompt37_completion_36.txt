  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but is being used in the mutated code fragment. This would cause the `stringify` function to use a different encoding than the one specified in the `options` object, which could result in a different output file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but is being used in the mutated code fragment. This would cause the `JSON.parse` function to throw an error if the input string is not valid JSON, which could result in a different output file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but is
