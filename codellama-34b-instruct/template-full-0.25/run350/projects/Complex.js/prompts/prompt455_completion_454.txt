  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method than `isNaN`, and it checks for infinity instead of NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to 0, instead of checking if the number is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are equal to 0, instead of checking if the number is NaN.

DONE.
