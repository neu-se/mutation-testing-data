  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "dispatch" property of the Promise prototype, while the replacement code uses the "resolve" property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "dispatch" property of the Promise prototype, while the replacement code uses the "reject" method of the Promise constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "dispatch" property of the Promise prototype, while the replacement code uses the "then" method of the Promise prototype.

DONE.
