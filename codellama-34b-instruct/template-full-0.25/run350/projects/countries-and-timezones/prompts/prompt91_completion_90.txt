  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the specified ID, but with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the specified ID, but with the `allTimezones` property set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { timezones: [] })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the specified ID, but with an empty `timezones` array, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different object.

DONE.
