 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `linkurl_path` is at the beginning of `pageurl_path`, instead of checking if `pageurl_path` is included in `linkurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) !== -1
