  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the precision of the latitude and longitude values by 1 decimal place, which could affect the accuracy of the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the precision of the latitude and longitude values by 1 decimal place, which could affect the accuracy of the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the precision of the latitude and longitude values, which could affect the accuracy of the calculations.

DONE.
