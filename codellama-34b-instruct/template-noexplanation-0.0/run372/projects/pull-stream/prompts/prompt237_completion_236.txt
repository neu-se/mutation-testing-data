  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment and will not cause any changes in the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This code fragment will cause the program to return `null` instead of `data` when the `test` function returns `true`. This may cause the program to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This code fragment will cause the program to return `data + 1` instead of `data` when the `test` function returns `true`. This may cause the program to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
