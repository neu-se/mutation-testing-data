  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for less than or equal to zero, while this replacement checks for strictly less than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality to zero, while this replacement checks for inequality to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the value of `a`, while this replacement checks for the value of `b`.

DONE.
