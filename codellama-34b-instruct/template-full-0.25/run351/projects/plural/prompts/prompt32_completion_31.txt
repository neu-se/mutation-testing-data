  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'`, which removes the last two characters of the word and adds 'es', while this new code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es'`, which removes the last three characters of the word and adds 'es'. This would cause the plural form of words ending in 'thesis' or 'crisis' to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'`,
