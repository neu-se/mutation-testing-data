  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code checks if `a` is equal to 0. If `a` is not equal to 0, the original code would execute the `if` block, while this new code would execute the `else` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code checks if `a` is not equal to 0 and `b` is equal to 0. If `a` is not equal to 0 and `b` is equal to 0, the original code would execute the `if` block, while this new code would execute the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior
