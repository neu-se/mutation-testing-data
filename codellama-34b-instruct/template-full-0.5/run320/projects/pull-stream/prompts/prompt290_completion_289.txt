  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!field
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator, which returns the opposite boolean value of its operand. In this case, if `field` is truthy, `!field` will be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator performs addition, and `field + 1` will produce a different result than `field` if `field` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[]` operator performs property access, and `field[0]` will produce a different result than `field` if `field` is not an array or an object with a `0` property.

DONE.
