  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
if (this['isInfinite']() && isNaN(this['re']) && isNaN(this['im'])) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the possibility of both `this['re']` and `this['im']` being `NaN`, which would not be caught by the original `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
if (this['isInfinite']() && typeof this['re'] === 'number' && typeof this['im'] === 'number') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the possibility of `this['re']` and `this['im']` being non-numerical values, which would not be caught by the original `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['re'] !== 0 && this['im'] !== 0) {
```
This would result in
