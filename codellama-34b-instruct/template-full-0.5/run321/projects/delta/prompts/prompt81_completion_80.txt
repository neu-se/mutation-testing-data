  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` will add the new operation to the end of the array, whereas `unshift` will add it to the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will return a copy of the array, whereas `unshift` will modify the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` will remove the last element from the array, whereas `unshift` will add a new element to the beginning.

DONE.
