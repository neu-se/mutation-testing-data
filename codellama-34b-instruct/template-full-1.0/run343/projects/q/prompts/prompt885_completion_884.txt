  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the first argument to be excluded from the node function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the integer 1 as the last argument to the node function call, rather than the expected node callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0](null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the first argument (the node callback function) to be called immediately with null as the argument, rather than being called after the node function call.

DONE.
