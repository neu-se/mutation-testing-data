  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(.*:)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that starts with a protocol scheme, including ones that are not http or https, and it would also capture the protocol scheme in a group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:(?!http:|https:).)*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that does not start with http: or https:, and it would not capture any part of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(^\/)(.*\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that starts with a forward slash and followed by any number of characters, and it would capture the forward slash and the character that comes after it in separate groups.

DONE.
