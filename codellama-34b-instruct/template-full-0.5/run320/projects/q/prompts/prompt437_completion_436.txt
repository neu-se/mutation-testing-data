  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1, making it impossible to track rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last rejection, making it impossible to track multiple rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first rejection, making it impossible to track multiple rejections.

DONE.
