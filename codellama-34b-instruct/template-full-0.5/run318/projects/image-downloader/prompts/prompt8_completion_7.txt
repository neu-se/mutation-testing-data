  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present in the destination path, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is an empty string. If the destination path has a file extension, the new code fragment would evaluate to `false` even though the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present in the destination path, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is not an empty string. If the destination path does not have a file extension, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true` even though the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) !== '.jpg'
```
This would result in
