  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the Object.prototype is a different object than the Promise.prototype, and the defer function uses the prototype chain to determine the properties and methods of the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would not have a prototype chain, and the defer function relies on the prototype chain to determine the properties and methods of the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be a number, and the defer function expects the `promise` object to be an object with a certain set of properties and methods.

DONE.
