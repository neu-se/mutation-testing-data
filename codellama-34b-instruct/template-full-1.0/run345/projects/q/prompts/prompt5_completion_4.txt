  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` would return the string representation of the `definition` function, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", Math.abs(definition)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` would return the absolute value of `definition`, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the string representation of `definition`, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
