  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `tz.d`, which is used to calculate the `dstOffset` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `tz.d`, which is used to calculate the `dstOffset` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `tz.d` by 2, which is used to calculate the `dstOffset` variable.

DONE.
