  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the array without the last element, which could be a stack trace that has not been handled yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(1, unhandledReasons.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the array without the first element, which could be a stack trace that has already been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the array without the last two elements, which could be stack traces that have not been handled yet.

DONE.
