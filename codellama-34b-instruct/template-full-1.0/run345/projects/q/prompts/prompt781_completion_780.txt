  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){throw new Error()})()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an unhandled error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){return""))()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){return""))()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
