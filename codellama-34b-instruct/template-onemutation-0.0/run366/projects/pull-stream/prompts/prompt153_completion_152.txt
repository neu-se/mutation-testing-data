  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is `true`. This would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with the wrong arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
