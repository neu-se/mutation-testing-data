  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this modified code fragment always adds the `http://` protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this modified code fragment always adds the `https://` protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while this modified code fragment always adds the `ftp://` protocol.
