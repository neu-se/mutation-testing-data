  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, while `otherIter.next()` is a function call that returns the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(1)` is a function call that returns the result of the function with the argument `1`, while `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(2)` is a function call that returns the result of the function with the argument `2`, while `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration.

DONE.
