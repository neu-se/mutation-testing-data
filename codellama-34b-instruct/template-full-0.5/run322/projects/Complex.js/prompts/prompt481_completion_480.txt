  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isNaN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is zero, while this code checks if the real part is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is zero, while this code checks if the real part is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is zero, while this code checks if the real part is infinite.

DONE.
