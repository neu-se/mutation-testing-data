  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns Complex['INFINITY'] when both the base and exponent are infinite, while the modified code returns Complex['NAN'] in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns Complex['NAN'] when the base is infinite and the exponent is non-zero, while the modified code returns Complex['INFINITY'] in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns Complex['NAN'] when the base is infinite and the exponent is zero, while the modified code returns Complex['ZERO'] in this case.

DONE.
