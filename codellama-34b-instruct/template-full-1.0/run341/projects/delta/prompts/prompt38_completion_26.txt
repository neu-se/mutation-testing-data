  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the expression, so `!b` would be `false` when `b` is `true`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is `true`. When `b` is `true`, the expression becomes `true && false`, which is `false`. When `b` is `false`, the expression becomes `false && false`, which is also `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is `false`. When `b` is `true`, the expression becomes `true || false`, which is `true`. When `b` is `false`, the expression becomes `false ||
