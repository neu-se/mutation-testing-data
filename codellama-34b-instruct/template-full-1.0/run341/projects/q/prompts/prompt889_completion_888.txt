  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cards.slice(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only slice the first 10 elements of the array, rather than slicing the entire array starting from the index specified by `cards.length - 10`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cards.slice(cards.length - 20, cards.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the last 20 elements of the array, rather than slicing the last 10 elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cards.reverse().slice(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the array before slicing the first 10 elements, rather than slicing the last 10 elements of the array in their original order.

DONE.
