  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, and the promise is resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown instead of calling the `rejected` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with an undefined value instead of being rejected.

DONE.
