  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `b`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` is a different operation than `b`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is.

DONE.
