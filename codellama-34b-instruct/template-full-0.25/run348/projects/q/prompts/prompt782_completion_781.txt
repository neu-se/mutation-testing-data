  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called twice, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called instead of `regardless`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called instead of `regardless`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
