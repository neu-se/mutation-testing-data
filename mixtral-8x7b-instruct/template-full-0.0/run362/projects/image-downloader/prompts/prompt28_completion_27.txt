 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http' === url.substring(0, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the URL starts with 'http' instead of using the `startsWith` method and `trimLeft` to remove leading whitespace. This could cause issues when the URL actually starts with 'https://'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf('https') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'https' is at the beginning of the URL string using `indexOf` instead of using the `startsWith` method and `trimLeft` to remove leading whitespace. This could cause issues when the URL actually starts with 'https://'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https' in url
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'https' string is present in the URL using the `in` operator, instead of using the `startsWith` method and `trimLeft
