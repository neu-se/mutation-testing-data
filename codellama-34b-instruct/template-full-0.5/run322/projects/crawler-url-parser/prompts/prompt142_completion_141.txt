  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the default file extension with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the default file extension with a forward slash, while this new code fragment removes the default file extension entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the default file extension with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces it with the string "default".

DONE.
