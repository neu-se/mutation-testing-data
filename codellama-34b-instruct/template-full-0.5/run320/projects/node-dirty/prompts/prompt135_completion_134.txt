  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key) + ':' + JSON.stringify(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to stringify the key and value separately, which could result in different output than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key) + ':' + JSON.stringify(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to stringify the key and value separately, which could result in different output than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + ':' + val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to concatenate the key and value directly, without stringifying them, which could result in different output than the original code.

DONE.
