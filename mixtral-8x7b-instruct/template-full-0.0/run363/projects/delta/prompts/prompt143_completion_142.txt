 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns twice the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing incorrect composition and concatenation operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the entire operation list, rather than the length of the peeked operation, causing incorrect composition and concatenation operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `length` property as a function, causing a TypeError and affecting the overall functionality of the `compose` method.

DONE.
