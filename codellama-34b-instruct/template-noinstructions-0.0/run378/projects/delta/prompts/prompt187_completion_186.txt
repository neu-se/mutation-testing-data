  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp[action])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp[action].getHandler()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `thisOp[action]` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp[action].getHandler()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `otherOp[action]` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
