  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This change will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, as it will now evaluate to `true` if `newOp.delete` is a number and `lastOp.delete` is a string, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` if both `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This change will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, as it will now evaluate to `true` if `newOp.delete` is a string and `lastOp.delete` is a number, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` if both `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are strings.
