  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object, while `{}` is an empty object, which is not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object, while `[]` is an empty array, which is not the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object, while `undefined` is a value that denotes the absence of any object, which is not the same.

DONE.
