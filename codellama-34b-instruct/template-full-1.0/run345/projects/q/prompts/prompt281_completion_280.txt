  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expected an array-like object as the argument to `array_slice`, but instead it would receive the number `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expected an array-like object as the argument to `array_slice`, but instead it would receive the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expected an array-like object as the argument to `array_slice`, but instead it would receive the value `NaN`.

DONE.
