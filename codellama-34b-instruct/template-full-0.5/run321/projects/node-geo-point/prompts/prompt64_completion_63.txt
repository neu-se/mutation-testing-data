  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the cosine function to calculate the bearing, while the modified code uses the sine function. The sine function will produce different results for the same input values, leading to different behavior in the overall calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the cosine function to calculate the bearing, while the modified code multiplies the angle by pi. This will produce different results for the same input values, leading to different behavior in the overall calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the cosine function to calculate the bearing, while the modified code uses the tangent function. The tangent function will produce different results for the same input values, leading to different behavior in the overall calculation.

DONE.
