  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `pop` removes and returns the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `shift` removes and returns the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `splice` removes and returns a specified number of elements from the beginning of an array.

DONE.
