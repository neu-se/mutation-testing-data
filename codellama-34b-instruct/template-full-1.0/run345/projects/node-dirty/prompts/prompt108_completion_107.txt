  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `buffer` to be a non-empty string, but `0` would make the `if` statement always evaluate to `false`, causing the wrong branch to be taken.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `buffer` to be a non-empty string, but `null` would make the `if` statement always evaluate to `false`, causing the wrong branch to be taken.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `buffer` to be a non-empty string, but `''` would make the `if` statement always evaluate to `false`, causing the wrong branch to be taken.

DONE.
