  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + 1` is a different expression than `x`, and it would change the value of the promise that is returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * 2` is a different expression than `x`, and it would change the value of the promise that is returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x - 1` is a different expression than `x`, and it would change the value of the promise that is returned.

DONE.
