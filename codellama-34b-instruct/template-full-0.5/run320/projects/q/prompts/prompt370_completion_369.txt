  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` and `_rejected` are two different functions that handle the promise's fulfillment and rejection, respectively. By replacing `_progressed` with `_rejected`, the promise would be rejected instead of being fulfilled, which could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` and `_fulfilled` are two different functions that handle the promise's fulfillment and rejection, respectively. By replacing `_progressed` with `_fulfilled`, the promise would be fulfilled instead of being rejected, which could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that handles the promise's progress, while `_fulfilled` and `_rejected` are functions
