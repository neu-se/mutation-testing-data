  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would receive `undefined` as the `args` parameter, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would receive `null` as the `args` parameter, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would receive an empty array as the `args` parameter, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
