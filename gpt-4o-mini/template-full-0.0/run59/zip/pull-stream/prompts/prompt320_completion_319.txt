Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `data` would cause the caller to receive a `null` value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors when the caller expects the original data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `data` would indicate that no value is being returned, which could lead to confusion or errors in the consuming code that expects a valid data object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because incrementing `data` by 1 changes its value, which could lead to incorrect processing or logic errors in any subsequent operations that rely on the original value of `data`.

DONE.
