  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index2
```
This would result in different behavior because `index2` is not a valid variable in the code, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` is not a valid property of the `this` object in the code, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is not a valid reference to the `undefined` value in the code, and would cause a reference error.

DONE.
