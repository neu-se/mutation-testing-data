  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray` would always return the opposite of `Array.isArray`, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isObject` is not a valid method on the `Array` prototype, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(null)` would return `false`, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
