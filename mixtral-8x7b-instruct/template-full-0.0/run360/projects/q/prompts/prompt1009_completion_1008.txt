 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject.bind(deferred));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `fail` method is called without a binding context, while the modified version uses `bind(deferred)` to ensure the `reject` method is called with the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(function(error) { deferred.reject(error); });
