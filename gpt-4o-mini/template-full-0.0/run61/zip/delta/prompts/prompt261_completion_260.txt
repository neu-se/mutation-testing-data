Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.merge(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because `merge` may combine attributes instead of calculating the differences, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling in the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.subtract(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because `subtract` might remove attributes from `thisOp` that are present in `otherOp`, rather than finding the differences, which could lead to loss of necessary attributes in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.equals(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because `equals` checks for equality rather than computing the differences, which would not modify the attributes in the delta as intended, potentially resulting in an incorrect delta output.

DONE.
