  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/b/` matches the letter "b", whereas the original regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^a]/` matches any character that is not "a", whereas the original regular expression `/a/` matches only the letter "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a|b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a|b/` matches either the letter "a" or the letter "b", whereas the original regular expression `/a/` only matches the letter "a".

DONE.
