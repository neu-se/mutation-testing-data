  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the calculated latitude of the destination point, whereas `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the starting point, whereas `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, whereas `φ1` is a variable representing the latitude of the starting point.

DONE.
