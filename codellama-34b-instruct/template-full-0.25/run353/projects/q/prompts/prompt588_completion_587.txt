  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `null` as an argument, which may cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(123);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `123` as an argument, which may cause it to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
