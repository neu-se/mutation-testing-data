 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"GET"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the promise to always fall back to the error handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => "get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `get` method from directly accessing the `get` property to invoking a function that returns the string `"get"`. This could cause issues if other parts of the codebase rely on the `get` method being a direct property access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"length"
