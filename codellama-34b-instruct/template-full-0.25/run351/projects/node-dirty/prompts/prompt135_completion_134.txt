  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string, while `JSON.parse` is used to parse a JSON string and convert it to a JavaScript object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string, while `JSON.stringify(key)` would only convert the `key` property of the object to a JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string, while `JSON.stringify(val)` would only convert the `val` property of the object to a JSON string.

DONE.
