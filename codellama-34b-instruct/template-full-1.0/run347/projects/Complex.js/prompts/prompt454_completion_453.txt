  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` is not the same as `NaN`, and `this['re'] === NaN` would always return `false` regardless of the value of `this['re']`. The `this['isNaN']()` method is used to check if the complex number is not a number, and it would not be affected by changing the value of `this['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` is not necessarily equal to `this['im']`, and the conditional statement would return `true` if `this['re']` is not equal to `this['im']`. The `this['isNaN']()` method is used to check if the complex number is not a number, and it would not be affected by changing the value of `this['re']`.
