  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function from `memoizeCountry`, and it may have different side effects or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(timezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeCountry` expects a `country` object as its argument, but `timezone` is a `timezone` object. This would likely cause a type error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeCountry` expects a `country` object as its argument, but `country` is not defined in the current scope. This would likely cause a reference error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
