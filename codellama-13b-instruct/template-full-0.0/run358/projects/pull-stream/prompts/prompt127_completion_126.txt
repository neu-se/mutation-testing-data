  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `i` after it has been incremented, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `i` before it has been incremented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `i` after it has been incremented, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `i` before it has been incremented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `i` after it has been incremented, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `i` plus one.

DONE.
