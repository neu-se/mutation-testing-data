  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` and `linkurl.host` are not the same, even if the hostnames are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host.includes(linkurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` and `linkurl.host` are not the same, even if one is a substring of the other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host.indexOf(linkurl.host) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` and `linkurl.host` are not the same, even if one is a substring of the other.

DONE.
