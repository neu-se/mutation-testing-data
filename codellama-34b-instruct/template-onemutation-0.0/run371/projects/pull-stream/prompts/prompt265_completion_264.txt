  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a non-null value, while `null` is a null value. The `if (err === true)` condition in the original code fragment would not be met if `err` is `null`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
