  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("intentional error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return 42; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `42`, which would trigger the fulfillment handler instead of the rejection handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("intentional error")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

DONE.
