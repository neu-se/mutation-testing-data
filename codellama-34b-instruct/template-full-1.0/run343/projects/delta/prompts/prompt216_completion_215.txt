  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() method would start from the second element instead of the first, potentially causing the concat() method to concatenate the wrong ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the reverse() method would invert the order of the ops, which could cause incorrect concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.filter(op => op.retain === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the filter() method would only include ops with a "retain" property that is set to true, potentially excluding important ops that the original code fragment would have included.

DONE.
