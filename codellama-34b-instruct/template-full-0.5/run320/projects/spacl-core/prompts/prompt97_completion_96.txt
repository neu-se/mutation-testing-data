  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` checks if the map has the specified key, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.values` returns an array of all the values in the map, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.entries` returns an array of all the key-value pairs in the map, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the specified key.

DONE.
