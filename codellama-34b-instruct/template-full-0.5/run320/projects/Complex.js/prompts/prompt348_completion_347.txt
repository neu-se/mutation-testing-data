  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number before using it in the calculation, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number, which would result in a different calculation.

DONE.
