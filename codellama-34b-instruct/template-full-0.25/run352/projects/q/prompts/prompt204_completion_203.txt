  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the file name instead of the file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the line number instead of the file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the column number instead of the file name and line number.

DONE.
