  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `1` argument would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, as it expects only two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` argument would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to return `null`, as it expects only two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `undefined` argument would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to return `undefined`, as it expects only two arguments.

DONE.
