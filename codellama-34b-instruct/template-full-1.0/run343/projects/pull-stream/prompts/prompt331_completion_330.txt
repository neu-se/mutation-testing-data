  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with no arguments, whereas the original code called the `once` function with `end` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with no arguments, whereas the original code called the `onEnd` function with `end` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with `end` as an argument, whereas the original code called the `once` function with no arguments.

DONE.
