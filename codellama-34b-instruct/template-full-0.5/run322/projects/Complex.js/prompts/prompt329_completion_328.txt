  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is a function that computes the hyperbolic sine of a number, while `sinh` is a property of the `Math` object that contains the hyperbolic sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is a function that computes the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while `cosh` is a property of the `Math` object that contains the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` is a function that computes the hyperbolic tangent of a number, while `tanh` is a property of the `Math` object that contains the hyperbolic tangent function.

DONE.
