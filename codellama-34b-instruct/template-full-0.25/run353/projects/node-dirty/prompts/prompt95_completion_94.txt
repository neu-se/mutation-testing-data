  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `rowStr` to uppercase, which could potentially cause issues with the JSON parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `rowStr` into an array of individual characters, which could potentially cause issues with the JSON parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.replace('key', 'value')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of the string 'key' with the string 'value', which could potentially cause issues with the JSON parsing.

DONE.
