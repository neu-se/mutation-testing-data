  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not have the same effect as the original function, which was used to create a wrapping of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of returning an object wrap.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null instead of an object wrap.

DONE.
