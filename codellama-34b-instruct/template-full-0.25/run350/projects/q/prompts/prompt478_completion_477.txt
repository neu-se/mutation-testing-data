  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `splice` method to remove the first element of the array, while `0` would cause it to remove the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `splice` method to remove the first element of the array, while `-1` would cause it to remove the last element in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `splice` method to remove the first element of the array, while `2` would cause it to remove the second element.

DONE.
