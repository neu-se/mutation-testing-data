  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Q(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while `then` is a method that returns a promise for the return value or thrown exception of either callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while `all` is a method that returns a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while `race` is a method that returns a promise for the return value of the generator or the first
