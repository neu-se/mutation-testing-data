  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/g, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regex, which means that all occurrences of `o` at the end of a word will be matched, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed from the regex, which means that the regex will not match words with uppercase `O` at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` at the end of the replacement string is removed.
