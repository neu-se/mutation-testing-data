  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would expect a string value, but would receive a null value instead, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would expect a string value, but would receive an empty string instead, which would cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would expect a string value, but would receive an undefined value instead, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
