  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` is a function that is called with the argument `abort === true ? null : abort`, whereas `onEnd()` is a function call that returns the result of calling `onEnd` with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd(abort)` is a function call that returns the result of calling `onEnd` with the argument `abort`, whereas `onEnd` is a function that is called with the argument `abort === true ? null : abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)` is a function call that returns the result of calling `onEnd` with the argument `abort === true ? null : abort`, whereas `
