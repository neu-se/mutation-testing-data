  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with a null value, regardless of whether the test function returned true or false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with the error message instead of null, which would cause the `find` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with the data value instead of null, which would cause the `find` function to return a different value.

DONE.
