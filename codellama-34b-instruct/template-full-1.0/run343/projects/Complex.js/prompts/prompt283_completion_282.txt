  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is a function that calculates the tangent of a number, while `Math.cos` is a function that calculates the cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of a number, while `-Math.sin` calculates the negative sine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(Math.cos, Math.sin)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest of its two arguments, while `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` are functions that calculate different trigonometric values.

DONE.
