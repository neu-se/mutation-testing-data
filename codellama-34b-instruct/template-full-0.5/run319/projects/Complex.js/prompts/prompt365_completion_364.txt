  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related but distinct trigonometric functions, and using `sinh` instead of `cosh` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related but distinct trigonometric functions, and using `tanh` instead of `cosh` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` and `cosh` are related but distinct trigonometric functions, and using `acosh` instead of `cosh` would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
