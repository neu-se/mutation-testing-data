  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice one index later than the original code, which could potentially include a different slice of the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice one index earlier than the original code, which could potentially include a different slice of the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice at a position twice as far from the beginning of the base delta as the original code, which could potentially include a different slice of the base delta.

DONE.
