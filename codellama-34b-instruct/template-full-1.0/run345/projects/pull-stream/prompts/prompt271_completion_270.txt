  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(function(v) { return v + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `values` is a stream of values, while `values.map(function(v) { return v + 1; })` is a stream of modified values. In the original code, the `values` are used as is, while in the modified code, the `values` are modified by adding 1 to each value before they are passed on to the next stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(function(v) { return v % 2 === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `values` is a stream of values, while `values.filter(function(v) { return v % 2 === 0; })` is a stream of filtered values, where only the even numbers are included. In the original code, all values are passed on to the next stream, while in the modified code, only the even
