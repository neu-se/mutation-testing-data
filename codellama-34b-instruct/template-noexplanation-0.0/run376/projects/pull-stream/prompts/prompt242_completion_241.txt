  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `test` function to receive the uppercase version of the data, which may cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.slice(1)
```
This change will cause the `test` function to receive a slice of the data, starting from the second element. This may cause the test to fail if it is expecting the entire data to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.split(' ').join('')
```
This change will cause the `test` function to receive a string that is the result of splitting the data on spaces and then joining the resulting array with an empty string. This may cause the test to fail if it is expecting the data to be in a specific format.

DONE.
