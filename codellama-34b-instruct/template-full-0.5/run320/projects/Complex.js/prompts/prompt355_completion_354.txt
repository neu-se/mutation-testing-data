  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `-Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `1 / Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input values.

DONE.
