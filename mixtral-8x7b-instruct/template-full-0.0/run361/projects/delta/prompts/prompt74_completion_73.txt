 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object, which may not have the same properties as `newOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `newOp` to null, which would cause an error in the following line `newOp = cloneDeep(newOp);`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number, which is not an object and would cause an error in the following line `newOp = cloneDeep(newOp);`.

DONE.
