  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a `null` value instead of the `data` object, which could cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive an `undefined` value instead of the `data` object, which could cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive an empty object instead of the `data` object, which could cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

DONE.
