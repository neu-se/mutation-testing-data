  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even when `buffer` is empty, which would lead to the error being thrown every time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to never evaluate to `true`, even when `buffer` is not empty, which would prevent the error from being thrown when it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only when `buffer` is empty, which would prevent the error from being thrown when it should be.

DONE.
