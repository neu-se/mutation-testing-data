Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `newOp` at the position `index + 1` instead of `index`, potentially causing the operations to be out of order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at `index` instead of replacing it, which could lead to loss of data and incorrect operation sequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert `newOp` at the beginning of the `ops` array, regardless of the current index, which could disrupt the intended order of operations.

DONE.
