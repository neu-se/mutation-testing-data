  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the callback was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fin(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, regardless of whether the callback was successful or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, but the rejection would occur even if the callback was successful.

DONE.
