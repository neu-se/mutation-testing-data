  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL would become "https://" instead of "http://", which could potentially break the URL parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://mydomain.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL would become "http://mydomain.com" instead of "http://" or "http://example.com", which could potentially break the URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL would become the value of the "baseurl" variable, which could potentially be undefined or not a valid URL.

DONE.
