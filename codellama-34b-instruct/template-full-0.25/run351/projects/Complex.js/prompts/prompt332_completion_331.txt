  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks whether `b` is equal to 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is 0, even if `a` is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks whether `a` is equal to 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is 0, even if `b` is not 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks whether `a + b`
