  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would iterate over all keys in the database, regardless of whether the `fn` function returns `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would iterate over all keys in the database, regardless of whether the `fn` function returns `undefined` or any other value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would iterate over all keys in the database, regardless of whether the `fn` function returns `null` or any other value.

DONE.
