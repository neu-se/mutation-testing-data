  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `prop` function, potentially causing the test to pass when it should fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `foo` property of the `prop` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original `prop` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) {
  return prop(data) === undefined;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the result of the `prop` function is `undefined`, which may not be the case for all inputs.

DONE.
