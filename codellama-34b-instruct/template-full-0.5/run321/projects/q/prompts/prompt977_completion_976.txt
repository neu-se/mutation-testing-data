  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, while `defer.promise` is a property that holds the promise returned by `defer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, while `defer.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise returned by `defer`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, while `defer.reject` is a function that rejects the promise returned by `defer`.

DONE.
