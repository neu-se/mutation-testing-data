 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[1], ref[2], ref[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially causing unexpected results if the function relies on the order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[2], ref[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the second argument and changes the order of the remaining arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially causing unexpected results if the function relies on the presence and order of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[0], 2 * ref[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the third argument by 2 before passing it to the `pull` function, potentially causing unexpected results if the function relies on the original value of the third argument.

DONE.
