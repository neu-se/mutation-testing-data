  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because while b === 0 would only check if b is equal to zero, b > 0 would also catch when b is negative, leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because b === 0 checks if b is equal to zero, while !b checks if b is truthy, which would be any number other than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because b === 0 checks if b is equal to zero, while b != 0 checks if b is not equal to zero, leading to a different outcome for b being negative.

DONE.
