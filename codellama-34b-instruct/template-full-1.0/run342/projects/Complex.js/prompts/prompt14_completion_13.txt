  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because cos(x) - 1 is not the same as sin(x) - 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because cos(x) - 1 is not the same as tan(x) - 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because cos(x) - 1 is not the same as e^x - 1.

DONE.
