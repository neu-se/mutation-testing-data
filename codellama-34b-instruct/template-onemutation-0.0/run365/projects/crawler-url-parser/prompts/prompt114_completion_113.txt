  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys of the map, whereas `values()` returns an iterator over the values of the map. In this case, the `gettype()` function expects a URL object as its first argument, but `keys()` returns a string representing the key of the map, which is not a URL object.
