  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `promise` variable, while the modified code fragment returns the integer value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not contain a `then` method, while the modified code fragment adds a `then` method that throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not contain a `then` method, while the modified code fragment adds a `then` method that returns the value `null`.

DONE.
