  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the values of `op.retain` and `op.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& true` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the values of `op.retain` and `op.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes && op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& op.retain` would cause the expression to evaluate to `false` if `op.retain` is falsy, regardless of the value of `op.attributes`.

DONE.
