  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function or object, and passing `null` would cause a "TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispatch' of null" error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function or object, and passing `undefined` would cause a "TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispatch' of undefined" error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function or object, and passing an empty function would cause a "TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispatch' of function () {}" error.

DONE.
