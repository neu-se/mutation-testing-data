  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not guaranteed to have an `encoding` property, and the code assumes that it does. If the `encoding` property is missing, the code will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not guaranteed to have a `throws` property, and the code assumes that it does. If the `throws` property is missing, the code will not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not guaranteed to have a `reviver` property, and the code assumes that it does. If the `reviver` property is missing, the code will not use a reviver function to parse the JSON data.

DONE.
