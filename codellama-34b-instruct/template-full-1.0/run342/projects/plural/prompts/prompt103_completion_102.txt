  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `u` flag is missing, causing the pattern to match both upper and lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the doubled slashes (`//`) are not escaped, causing the pattern to match only the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the pattern is no longer anchored to the start of the string, causing it to match any substring within the string.

DONE.
