Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a substring of length 1 from the `insert` property, regardless of the actual length of the string, potentially leading to incorrect data being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty substring from the `insert` property, which would not reflect the intended behavior of returning the specified length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to return a substring that is one character longer than intended, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data being returned if the length exceeds the actual string length.

DONE.
