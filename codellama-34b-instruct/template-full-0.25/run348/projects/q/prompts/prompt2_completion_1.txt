  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a string instead of a function, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null instead of a function, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return undefined instead of a function, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
