  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

replacer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is used to replace values in the JSON string, while `replacer = null` would simply set the `replacer` variable to `null`, which would not have any effect on the JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = function(key, value) { return key }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer
