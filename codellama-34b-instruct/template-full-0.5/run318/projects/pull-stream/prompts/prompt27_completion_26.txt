  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with an additional argument, which could cause it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
