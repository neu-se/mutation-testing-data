  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is expected to return an empty array, but instead it would return an array with three elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is expected to return an array, but instead it would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is expected to return an array, but instead it would return `undefined`.

DONE.
