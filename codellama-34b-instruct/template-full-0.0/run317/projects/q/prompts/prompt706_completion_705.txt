  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat` returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array, while `concat` returns a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `concat` returns a new array with all the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array.

DONE.
