  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `end` is not equal to `true`, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
