  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.state` would return the state of the `inspect` property, which is not the same as the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.fulfilled` would return a boolean indicating whether the promise is fulfilled, which is not the same as the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.rejected` would return a boolean indicating whether the promise is rejected, which is not the same as the state of the promise.

DONE.
