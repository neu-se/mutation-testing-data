  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except a dot or a dollar sign, while the new fragment matches any character except a dot.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$]|\\.)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except a dot or a dollar sign, while the new fragment matches any character except a dot or a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])|(\\.)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except a dot or a dollar sign, while the new fragment matches any character except a dot or a backslash, or a backslash followed by a dot.

DONE.
