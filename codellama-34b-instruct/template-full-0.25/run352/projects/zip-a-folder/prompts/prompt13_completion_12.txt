  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is a string, and adding 1 to it would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is a string, and converting it to uppercase would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is a string, and splitting it into an array of characters would result in a different data structure.

DONE.
