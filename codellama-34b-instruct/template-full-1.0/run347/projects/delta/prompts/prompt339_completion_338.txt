  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the baseIndex instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the slice function to return the wrong slice of the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over a number of base delta ops equal to the length of the embedded object, potentially causing the slice function to return the wrong slice of the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + Object.keys(embedType)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the first character of the embedType string to the baseIndex, potentially causing the slice function to return the wrong slice of the base delta.

DONE.
