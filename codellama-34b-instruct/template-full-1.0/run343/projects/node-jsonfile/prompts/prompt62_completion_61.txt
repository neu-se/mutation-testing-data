  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content ^ ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator is a bitwise XOR operator, which means it performs a logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits in the two operands. In this case, it would flip the bits of the `content` variable, resulting in a completely different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is a concatenation operator in JavaScript, and it would concatenate the `content` variable with the number 1. This would result in a different string being passed to the `JSON.parse()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content = content + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `content` variable by adding the letter 'a' to the end of the string. This would result in a different string being passed to the `JSON.parse()` function.
