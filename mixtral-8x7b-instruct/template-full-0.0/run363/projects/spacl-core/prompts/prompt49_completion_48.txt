 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always assigns the string '1' to the props array, instead of extracting the captured group from the regex match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts a random float number into the props array, instead of extracting the captured group from the regex match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date().getTime()
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the current timestamp as a number into the props array, instead of extracting the captured group from the regex match.

DONE.
