 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array could end up containing `null` values, which might not be expected by the developers or could cause issues in other parts of the code that rely on the array only containing reason strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array would end up containing an empty object instead of the error reason string. This could cause issues in other parts of the code that rely on the array only containing reason strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Unhandled rejection')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created and added to the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the original error reason string. This could cause issues in other parts of the code that rely on the array containing specific error reason strings.

DONE.
