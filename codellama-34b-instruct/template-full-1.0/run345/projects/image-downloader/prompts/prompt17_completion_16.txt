  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method changes the case of the filename, potentially causing the file to not be found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.fileName(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.fileName()` returns the file name without the extension, which could cause the file to be saved with the wrong extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${decodedBasename}-${generateRandomString(5)}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random string to the end of the file name, potentially causing the file to be saved with the wrong name.

DONE.
