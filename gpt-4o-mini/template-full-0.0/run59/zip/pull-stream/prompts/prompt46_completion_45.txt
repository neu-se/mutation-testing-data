Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the loop from 1 to 0, causing the first argument to be skipped in the processing, which may lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the loop index to the length of the arguments, causing the loop to not execute at all since the condition `i < length` will be false from the start.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it starts the loop at index 2, which means the first two arguments will be ignored in the processing, potentially leading to unexpected results depending on the input.

DONE.
