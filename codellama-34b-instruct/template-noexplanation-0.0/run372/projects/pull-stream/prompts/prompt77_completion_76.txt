  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop
```
This change will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, even if the `read` function returns `null` or `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed
```
This change will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, even if the `read` function returns `null` or `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This change will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, even if the `read` function returns `null` or `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
