  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, while this new code fragment uses the `attr` method to set the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, while this new code fragment uses the `prop` method to get the value of the `href` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', 'new_value')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not set the value of the `href` attribute, while this new code fragment sets the value of the `href` attribute to a new value.

DONE.
