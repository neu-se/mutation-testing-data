  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the substring is not found, instead of `false` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === chunk.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the substring is found at the end of the string, instead of `false` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the substring is found anywhere in the string, instead of `false` as in the original code.

DONE.
