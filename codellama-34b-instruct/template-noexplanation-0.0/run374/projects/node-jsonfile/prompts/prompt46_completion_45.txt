  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This will cause the `writeFileSync` function to call `fs.writeFile` instead of `fs.writeFileSync`, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This will cause the `writeFileSync` function to call `fs.writeFileSync` with the same arguments as the original code, but with a different operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, { ...options, throws: false })
```
This will cause the `writeFileSync` function to call `fs.writeFileSync` with the same arguments as the original code, but with a different option value.

DONE.
