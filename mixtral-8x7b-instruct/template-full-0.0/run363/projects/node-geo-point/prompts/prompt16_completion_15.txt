 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of converting the input coordinates, leading to incorrect results or errors in other methods using the `fromGeoJSON` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array instead of the input coordinates, leading to errors in other methods using the `fromGeoJSON` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ type: 'Feature', properties: {}, geometry: { type: 'Point', coordinates: point.coordinates } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the input coordinates in a GeoJSON Feature object, which is not expected by other methods using the `fromGeoJSON` method, potentially leading to errors or incorrect results.

DONE.
