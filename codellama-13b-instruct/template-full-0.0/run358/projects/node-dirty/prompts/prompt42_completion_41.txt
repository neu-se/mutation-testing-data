  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not set the value for the given key, and the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value for the given key to `null`, and the `get` method would return `null` instead of the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value for the given key to the current value of the key, and the `get` method would return the current value of the key instead of the actual value.

DONE.
