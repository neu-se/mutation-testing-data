Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value by adding 1, which changes the output of the progress notification, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original value with `undefined`, which could cause the progress notification to not convey any meaningful information, affecting the promise's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Progress error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it intentionally throws an error during the progress notification, which would trigger the error handling mechanism instead of propagating the progress value, leading to a rejected promise.

DONE.
