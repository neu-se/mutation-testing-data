 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the value to the callback, while this change would always pass null as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the value to the callback, while this change would pass a string 'Error' instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(null, [null, _value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with two arguments, while this change uses the `apply` method to call the callback with two arguments, which could potentially have different behavior depending on how the callback is implemented.

DONE.
