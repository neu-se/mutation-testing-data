Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly count a plus sign as a minus sign, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the character '0' as a minus sign, which is not correct and could lead to erroneous calculations when parsing complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow any character that is not a minus sign to be treated as a valid input, potentially leading to incorrect parsing and handling of complex numbers.

DONE.
