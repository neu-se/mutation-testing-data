  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `spec` argument is a string, but the `compile` function expects an object with a `spec` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile({ spec: spec });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `spec` argument is an object with a `spec` property, but the `compile` function expects a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, { version: '1.1' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `spec` argument is a string, but the `compile` function expects an object with a `spec` property and
