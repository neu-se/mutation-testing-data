  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[3]`, which is different from the original code fragment where it was `ref[2]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[1]`, which is the same as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[0]`, which is the same as the first argument.

DONE.
