  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp - 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOp` variable is used as a number in the `delta.retain` method, so subtracting 0 from it would change the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOp` variable is used as a number in the `delta.retain` method, so subtracting 1 from it would change the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOp` variable is used as a number in the `delta.retain` method, so multiplying it by 2 would change the value.

DONE.
