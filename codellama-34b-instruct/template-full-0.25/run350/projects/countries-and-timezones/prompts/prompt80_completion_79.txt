  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which could potentially cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first character of the timezone name, which could potentially cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.split(' ').join('_')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` and `join()` methods would replace any spaces in the timezone name with underscores, which could potentially cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone than expected.

DONE.
