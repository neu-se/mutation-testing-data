  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a boolean value, so `end + 1` would always result in `NaN`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a boolean value, so `!end` would always result in `false`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a boolean value, so initializing it to `true` would change the flow of the program.

DONE.
