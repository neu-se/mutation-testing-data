  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(callback.bind(this)).nfapply```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is not defined on `Promise` objects, and would break the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(callback.bind(this)).nfapply```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is not defined on `Promise` objects, and would break the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(function(){return callback.apply(deferred.makeNodeResolver())})```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on `Promise` objects, and would break the code.

DONE.
