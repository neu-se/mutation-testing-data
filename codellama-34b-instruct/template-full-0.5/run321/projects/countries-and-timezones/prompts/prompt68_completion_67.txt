  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country && country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `country.id` would be evaluated first, which would cause a `TypeError` if `country` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country || country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `country.id` would be evaluated first, which would cause a `TypeError` if `country` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country ? country.id : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `country.id` would be evaluated first, which would cause a `TypeError` if `country` is not an object.

DONE.
