  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test("localhost")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for the string "localhost", whereas the original code fragment would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test("example.com")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return false for the string "example.com", whereas the original code fragment would return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!require('url').parse(currentUrlStr).protocol.endsWith(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return false if the URL protocol ends with a colon (e.g. "http:", "https:"), whereas the original code fragment would return true.

DONE.
