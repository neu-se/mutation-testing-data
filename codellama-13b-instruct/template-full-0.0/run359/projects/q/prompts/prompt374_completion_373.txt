  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e
```
This would result in different behavior because the `e` variable is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, so it would throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, so it would throw a TypeError.

DONE.
