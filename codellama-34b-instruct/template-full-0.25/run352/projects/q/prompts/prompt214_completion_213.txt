  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and an object is not a thenable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if the object is an instance of the specified class, and a promise is not an instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a property of a thenable object, and a promise is a thenable object.

DONE.
