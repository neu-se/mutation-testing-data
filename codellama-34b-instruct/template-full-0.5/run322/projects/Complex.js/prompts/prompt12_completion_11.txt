  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp(-x)` would result in a different value than `Math.exp(-y)` when `x` and `y` are different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp(-x)` would result in a different value than `Math.exp(x)` when `x` is a positive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp(-x)` would result in a different value than `Math.exp(x * y)` when `x` and `y` are different values.

DONE.
