  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude - point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points in the latitude direction, rather than the longitude direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points in the longitude direction, but with an added offset of 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points in the longitude direction, but with a subtracted offset of 180 degrees.

DONE.
