  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable would be reassigned to `undefined`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with an undefined value, leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable would be reassigned to `null`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a null value, leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = new Promise(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable would be reassigned to a new promise that is never resolved, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a pending promise, leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
