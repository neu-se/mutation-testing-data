  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [value, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator is used on the `value` object, attempting to delete the property at index `1`, instead of setting a new property on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the setter function would be called with a modified value, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key + 1, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the setter function would be called with a different key, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
