  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is an alias for `Q.timeout` and it would introduce a delay before the dispatch method is called, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise without calling the dispatch method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the dispatch method to the value resolved by the promise, rather than the promise itself.

DONE.
