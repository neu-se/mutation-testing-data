  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the wrong number of arguments, whereas the original code fragment called it with the correct number of arguments.

DONE.
