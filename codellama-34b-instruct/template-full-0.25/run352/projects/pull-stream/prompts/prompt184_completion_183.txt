  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous element in the array instead of the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i+1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i*2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at the current index multiplied by 2 instead of the current element.

DONE.
