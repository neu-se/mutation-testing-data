  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, which is a string, and the `slice` method takes two arguments, the start and end index of the substring to be extracted. In this case, the start index is 8 and the end index is -1, which means that the substring starting from the 8th character to the end of the string will be extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, which is a string, and the `slice` method takes two arguments, the start and end index of the substring to be extracted. In this case, the start index is 8 and the end index is -2, which
