  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const buggyLineLength = line.length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.length` expression would be evaluated twice, resulting in an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const buggyLineLength = line.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.length` expression would be evaluated one less time, resulting in an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const buggyLineLength = line.length / 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.length` expression would be divided by zero, resulting in a runtime error.

DONE.
