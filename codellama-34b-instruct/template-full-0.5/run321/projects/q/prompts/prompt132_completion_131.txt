  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` and `Object.prototype.toLocaleString` are different methods with different purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` and `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` are different methods with different purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` and `Object.prototype.valueOf` are different methods with different purposes.

DONE.
