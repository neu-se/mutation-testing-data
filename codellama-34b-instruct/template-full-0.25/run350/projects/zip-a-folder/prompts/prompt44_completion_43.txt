  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` is used to add a file to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.directory` is used to add a directory to the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `zipArchive.directory` is a boolean that indicates whether the directory should be added recursively. Setting it to `true` would result in the directory being added recursively, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false, {
    ignore: (file) => file.name.endsWith('.js')
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `zipArchive.directory` is an options object that can be used to customize the behavior of the method. In this
