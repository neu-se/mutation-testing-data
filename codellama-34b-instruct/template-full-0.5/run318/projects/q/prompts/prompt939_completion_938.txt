  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would return a new array containing the arguments passed to the function, whereas `baseArgs.concat` would return a new array containing the elements of `baseArgs` followed by the elements of `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs + args` would concatenate the strings `baseArgs` and `args`, whereas `baseArgs.concat` would concatenate the arrays `baseArgs` and `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.push(args)` would add the elements of `args` to the end of the `baseArgs` array, whereas `baseArgs.concat` would return a new array containing the elements of `baseArgs` followed by the elements of `args`.
