  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `acc` to be a variable, but `null` would return an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `acc` to be a variable, but `undefined` would return an error instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `acc` to be a variable, but `0` would return an incorrect value instead.

DONE.
