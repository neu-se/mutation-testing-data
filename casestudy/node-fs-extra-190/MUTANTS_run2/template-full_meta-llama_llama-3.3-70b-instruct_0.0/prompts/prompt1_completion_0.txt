Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync(srcFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the source file instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file copying.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!fs.existsSync(destFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the non-existence of the destination file, which is the opposite of the original condition, potentially causing the function to clobber or throw an error when it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destFile.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination file path is not empty, rather than checking if the file actually exists, potentially causing the function to incorrectly handle file copying when the destination path is a non-empty string that doesn't correspond to an existing file.

DONE.
