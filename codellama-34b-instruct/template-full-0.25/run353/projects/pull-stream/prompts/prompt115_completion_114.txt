  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` returns the accumulated value, while `null` would return a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` returns the accumulated value, while `undefined` would return an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` returns the accumulated value, while `0` would return a zero value.

DONE.
