  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.concat(illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `misc` and `illnesses` arrays, resulting in a longer array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.filter(function(word) { return word.length > 5 })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the `misc` array to only include words with more than 5 characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.map(function(word) { return word.toUpperCase() })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map the `misc` array to an array of uppercase words.

DONE.
