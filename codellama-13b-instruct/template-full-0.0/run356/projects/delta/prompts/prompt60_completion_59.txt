  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is an empty string, while the new code fragment checks if the argument is a string with a length of 1. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is an empty string, while the new code fragment checks if the argument is a string with a length greater than 0. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is an empty string, while the new code fragment checks if the argument is a string with a length less than 0.
