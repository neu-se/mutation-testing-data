  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain - newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.retain - newOp.retain` would result in a negative number, which is not a valid input for the `retain` property, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain / newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.retain / newOp.retain` would result in a different value than `lastOp.retain + newOp.retain`, and could potentially cause errors if the resulting value is not a valid input for the `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[index - 1].attributes = newOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `attributes
