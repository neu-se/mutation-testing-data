  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `end` variable, which means that the function would always enter the `else` branch and never return `end`, even if it had previously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` is added to the value of `end`, which means that the function would never return `end` if it was originally `0`, and would always return a value greater than `1` for any other value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a non-error value, but it is not a valid value for the `end` parameter, which is expected to be a boolean. If the function is called with `null` instead of `end`, it would return `null` instead of the expected value.
