  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would be called instead of `fulfill`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument is being passed to `fulfill`, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
