  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is not the same as the original `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.catch(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is not the same as the original `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.finally(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is not the same as the original `promise` object.

DONE.
