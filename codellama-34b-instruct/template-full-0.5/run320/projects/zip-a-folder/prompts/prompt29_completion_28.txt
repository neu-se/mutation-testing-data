  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with a null value instead of the expected value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value instead of a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with an undefined value instead of the expected value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value instead of a non-undefined value.

DONE.
