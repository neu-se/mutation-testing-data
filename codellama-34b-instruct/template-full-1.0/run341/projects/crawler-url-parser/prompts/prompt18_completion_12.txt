  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always negate the baseUrlStr, even if it is not defined, which could cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the 'http://' protocol to the beginning of the baseUrlStr, even if it already starts with 'http://', which could cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substr(7)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first 7 characters of the baseUrlStr, even if it does not have enough characters, which could cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
