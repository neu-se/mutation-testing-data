  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object` would always evaluate to `false` if `object` is not a falsy value, unlike the original code which would evaluate to `true` if `object` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object == null` would evaluate to `true` if `object` is `null` or `undefined`, unlike the original code which would evaluate to `true` if `object` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object !== 'object'` would evaluate to `true` if `object` is not an object, unlike the original code which would evaluate to `true` if `object` is not an object and is not `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
