  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not using the `then` method, which is used to handle the resolution of a promise. By adding the `then` method, the promise will be resolved immediately, which could cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called before the promise is actually rejected.
