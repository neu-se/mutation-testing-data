  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string, starting at the given index, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire `spec` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a new string, starting at the given index and ending at the end of the string, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire `spec` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/^./, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string, with the first character removed, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire `spec` string.

DONE.
