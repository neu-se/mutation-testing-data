  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the `nodeback` function as an argument to `Q.nsend`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the `nodeback` function from the arguments passed to `Q.nsend`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `nodeback` function as an argument to `Q.nsend`, but it would also include an extra argument that is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
