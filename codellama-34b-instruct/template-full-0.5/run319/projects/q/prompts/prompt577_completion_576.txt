  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" operator to move the generator to the next iteration, while the new code fragment uses the "throw" operator to raise an exception and exit the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"done"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" operator to move the generator to the next iteration, while the new code fragment uses the "done" operator to indicate that the generator has finished iterating and return the final value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" operator to move the generator to the next iteration, while the new code fragment uses the "yield" operator to return a value from the generator and pause its execution.

DONE.
