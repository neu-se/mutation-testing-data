  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` cancels a previously scheduled `setTimeout` call, whereas `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` requests that a function be called before the next repaint, whereas `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a specified delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` schedules a function to be called repeatedly at a specified interval, whereas `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called only once.

DONE.
