  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is missing, which would cause the regular expression to be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to be case-insensitive, which would cause the regular expression to match words
