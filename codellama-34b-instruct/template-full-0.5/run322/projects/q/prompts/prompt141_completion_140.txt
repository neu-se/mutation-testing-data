  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source` is a property of the `p` object, and `next` is a property of `p.source`. By adding `.next`, we are accessing the `next` property of `p.source`, which may not be the same as the original `p.source` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.previous
```
This would result in different behavior because `previous` is a property of `p.source`, and it may not be the same as the original `p.source` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.next.next
```
This would result in different behavior because we are accessing the `next` property of `p.source` twice, which may not be the same as the original `p.source` property.

DONE.
