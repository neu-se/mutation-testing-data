  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the wrong part of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the wrong part of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the wrong part of the string.

DONE.
