  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `s` is an object, not if it is a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `s` is a function, not if it is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.hasOwnProperty('sink')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `s` has a property called `sink`, not if it is a truthy value.

DONE.
