  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to resolve successfully even if the request fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Timeout Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `error` event handler and passed to the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Timeout Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement would log a message to the console, but the promise would still be resolved successfully.

DONE.
