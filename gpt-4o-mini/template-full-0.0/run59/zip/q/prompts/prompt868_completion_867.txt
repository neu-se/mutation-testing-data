Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the value, it would reject the promise, leading to a failure state instead of a success state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` regardless of the original value, potentially leading to unexpected results for consumers of the promise who expect the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value incremented by 1, altering the intended result and potentially causing issues in subsequent promise chains that rely on the original value.

DONE.
