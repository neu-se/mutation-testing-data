  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the variable `i` instead of incrementing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the variable `i` by 2 instead of incrementing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i * i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the variable `i` instead of incrementing it.

DONE.
