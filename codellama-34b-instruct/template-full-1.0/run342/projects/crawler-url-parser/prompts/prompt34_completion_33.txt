  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` method is not a valid method in the context of the original code. It would throw a `TypeError` since `URL.parse()` expects a string as the first argument, but the code is passing an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` method returns an object containing the parsed URL, and `toString()` method on the object would return the string representation of the object, which would be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse("invalid_url")
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` method would throw a `URLError` because the provided URL is invalid, which would cause the code to handle the error differently.

DONE.
