  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(flush).bind(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `process` object as the `this` context for the `flush` function, which is not the same as the original code where `this` is the global object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(flush)[Symbol.iterator]();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.iterator` method on the `process.nextTick(flush)` function, which would return the iterator for the function, and not the result of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(flush())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function with the global object as the `this` context, and not the `process` object as in the original code.

DONE.
