  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a different method than `deferred.resolve`, and it would cause the promise to reject instead of resolving.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `deferred.resolve`, and it would cause the promise to reject instead of resolving.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a different value than `deferred.resolve`, and it would cause the promise to resolve with a value of `42` instead of the original value.

DONE.
