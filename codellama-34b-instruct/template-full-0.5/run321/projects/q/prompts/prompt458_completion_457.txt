  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional `then` callback to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional `catch` callback to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional `finally` callback to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the promise.

DONE.
