  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error === true ? null : error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the condition, so if the `err` argument is not null, it would return `null` instead of the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof TypeError ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `err` argument is an instance of `TypeError`, and if so, return `null`, instead of the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message.indexOf('Not found') !== -1 ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the error message contains the string "Not found", and if so, return `null`, instead of the error object.

DONE.
