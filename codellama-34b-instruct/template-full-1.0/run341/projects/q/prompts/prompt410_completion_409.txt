  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.inspect().reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `value.inspect()` would not have any effect on the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().thenable
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.inspect().thenable` would create a new promise that would be resolved with the value of `value.inspect()`, whereas `value.inspect()` would not create a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().catch(function(error) { return error.stack; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.inspect().catch(function(error) { return error.stack; })` would catch any errors that occur while executing `value.inspect()` and return the error stack trace, whereas `value.inspect()` would not
