  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any string that starts with a hash character, regardless of whether it is followed by any other characters. This could cause the function to return incorrect results if the input string contains a hash character at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any string that starts with a hash character, followed by any number of characters. This could cause the function to return incorrect results if the input string contains a hash character at the beginning, but the rest of the string is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any string that starts with a hash character, but would not allow any other characters to follow. This could cause the function to return incorrect results if the input string contains a hash character at the beginning, but the rest
