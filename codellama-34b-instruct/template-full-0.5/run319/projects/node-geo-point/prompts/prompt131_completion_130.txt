  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would return a different tile coordinate, which could cause the test to fail if it relies on the specific tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would return a different tile coordinate, which could cause the test to fail if it relies on the specific tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would return a different tile coordinate, which could cause the test to fail if it relies on the specific tile coordinate.

DONE.
