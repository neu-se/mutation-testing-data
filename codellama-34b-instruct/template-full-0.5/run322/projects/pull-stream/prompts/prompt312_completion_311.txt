  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `null` does not call any function, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `undefined` does not call any function, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `false` does not call any function, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
