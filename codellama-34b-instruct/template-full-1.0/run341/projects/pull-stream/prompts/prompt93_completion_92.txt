  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null, data` arguments only if the `test` function returns a falsy value. However, in this mutated code, the `cb` function is called with `null, data` arguments regardless of the return value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with `data` argument only if the `test` function returns a falsy value. However, in this mutated code, the `cb` function is called with `data` argument regardless of the return value of `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with `data` argument only if the `
