  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"wrong_file"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions would attempt to read and write to a different file than the one specified in the function call, which would likely cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions would attempt to read and write to a null file, which would likely cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions would attempt to read and write to a file with a name that is different from the one specified in the function call, which would likely cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
