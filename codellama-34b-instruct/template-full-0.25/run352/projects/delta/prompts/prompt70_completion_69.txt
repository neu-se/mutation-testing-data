  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `Object.keys(attributes).length` is greater than 0, but this change would check if it's greater than 1. This means that if the `attributes` object has only one key, the original code would consider it as having no attributes, while this change would consider it as having attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `Object.keys(attributes).length` is greater than 0, but this change would check if it's equal to 0. This means that if the `attributes` object has any keys, the original code would consider it as having attributes, while this change would consider it as having no attributes.
