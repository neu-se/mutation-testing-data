  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace('href', 'rel')
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'href' attribute is replaced with 'rel', which could break the functionality of the code that relies on the 'href' attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only parse the child 'a' elements of the current element, instead of all the 'a' elements in the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.parseHTML(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be parsing an entire HTML document, instead of just a fragment of HTML.

DONE.
