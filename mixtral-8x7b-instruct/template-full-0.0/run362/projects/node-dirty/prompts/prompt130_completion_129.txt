 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
const key = Object.keys(this._queue)[0], cbs = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it always selects the first key from `this._queue` instead of iterating over all keys and their corresponding callbacks. This could lead to skipping some data or processing data out of order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
const key = Symbol('key'), cbs = [];
