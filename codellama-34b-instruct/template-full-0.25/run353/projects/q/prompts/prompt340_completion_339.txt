  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this new code fragment only checks for the "fulfilled" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this new code fragment checks for any state other than "pending".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this new code fragment checks for any state other than "rejected".

DONE.
