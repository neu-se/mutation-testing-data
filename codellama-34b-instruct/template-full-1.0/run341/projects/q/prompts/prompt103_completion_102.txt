  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++index` operator would increment the variable `index` before accessing the `this` array, which would change the index that the code accesses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` expression would access the value of the variable `index` instead of the value of the `this[index]` expression, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would access the next element in the `this` array instead of the current element, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
