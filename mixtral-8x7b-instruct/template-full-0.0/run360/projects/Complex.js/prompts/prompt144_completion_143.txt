 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the real part of the current complex number with the real part of the divisor, instead of checking if either of them is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex['NAN']` when multiplying a complex number with an infinite or zero number, even if the other condition is not met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the imaginary part of the current complex number with the real part of the divisor, instead of checking if either of them is infinite.

DONE.
