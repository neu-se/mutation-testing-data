  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a different property of the `a` object, and it is not guaranteed to be finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `a['abs']`, which means that the resulting value will be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value of `a['abs']` by 2, which means that the resulting value will be different.

DONE.
