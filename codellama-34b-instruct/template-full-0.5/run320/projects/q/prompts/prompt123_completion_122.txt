  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the object's own enumerable property names, rather than all property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the object's prototype's own enumerable property names, rather than all property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of Object.keys(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the object's own enumerable property names, rather than all property names.

DONE.
