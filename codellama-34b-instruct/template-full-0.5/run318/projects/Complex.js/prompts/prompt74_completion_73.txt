  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `z['im']` to the result of `a.match(/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|./g)`, which is a regular expression that matches a number. Setting `z['im']` to `1` would cause the code to always return a complex number with a real part of `0` and an imaginary part of `1`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = a['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `z['im']` to the result of `a.match(/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|./g)`, which is a regular expression that matches a number. Setting `z['im']`
