  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for the `allow` method, regardless of the verb being passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs && this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true for the `allow` method if the verb is in the `verbs` property and the value is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for the `deny` method, regardless of the verb being passed in.

DONE.
