  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `data` arguments, which would cause the `map` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `null` arguments, which would cause the `map` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `true` and `data` arguments, which would cause the `map` function to return a different value.

DONE.
