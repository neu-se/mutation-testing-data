 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object['keys']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the 'keys' property of the Object constructor using bracket notation instead of the dot notation. This could potentially lead to issues if a malicious actor attempts to modify the Object constructor's prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Reflect.ownKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Reflect.ownKeys method, which returns an array of all own property keys on the specified object, including non-enumerable properties. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the code relies on the enumerable properties only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.prototype.toString.call(Object).split(' ')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Object.prototype.toString method to get the string representation of the Object constructor and then extracts the 'Object' keyword using string manipulation.
