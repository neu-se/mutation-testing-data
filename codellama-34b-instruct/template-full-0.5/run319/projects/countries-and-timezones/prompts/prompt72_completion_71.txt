  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, 'invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an invalid argument, which would cause it to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive the same argument twice, which would cause it to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a different argument than the original code fragment, which would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
