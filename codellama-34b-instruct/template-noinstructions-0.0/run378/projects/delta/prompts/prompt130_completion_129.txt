  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be off by one, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be off by one, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be off by two, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

DONE.
