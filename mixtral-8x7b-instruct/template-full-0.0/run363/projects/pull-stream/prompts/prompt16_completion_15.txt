 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prioritize the default case, causing the function to behave differently when there are more than 4 arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the loop variable as the number of arguments to forward to the recursive `pull` call, causing incorrect behavior when there are more than 4 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select the number of arguments to forward to the recursive `pull` call, causing unpredictable behavior and potentially incorrect results.

DONE.
