  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a)` would return the square root of `a`, which is not the same as `Math.sqrt(a + b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` would return the square root of `b`, which is not the same as `Math.sqrt(a + b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a + b)` would return the square root of `a + b`, which is not the same as `Math.sqrt(a)`.

DONE.
