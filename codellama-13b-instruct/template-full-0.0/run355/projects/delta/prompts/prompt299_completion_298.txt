  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.length()` method returns the length of the line, while the original code fragment `line` returns the line itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.slice(0, 1)` method returns the first character of the line, while the original code fragment `line` returns the line itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split('\n')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.split('\n')[0]` method returns the first line of the string, while the original code fragment `line` returns the line itself.

DONE.
