  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `notResolved` is not a valid method of the `deferred` object, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is not a valid object, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.notResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `notResolved` is not a valid method of a `promise` object, so it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
