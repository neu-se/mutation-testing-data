  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, but the original code does not use `bind`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, but the original code does not use `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, but the original code does not use `call`.

DONE.
