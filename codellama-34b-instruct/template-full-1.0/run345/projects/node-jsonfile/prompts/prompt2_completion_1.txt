  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `readFile` method directly without going through the `universalify` abstraction layer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asyncify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `asyncify` library instead of `universalify` to wrap the `readFile` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promise.readFile(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `promise` API of the `fs` module instead of `universalify` to perform the read operation.

DONE.
