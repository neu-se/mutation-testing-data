  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `then` method would not be called on the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `then` method would not be called on the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `then` method would not be called on the returned value.

DONE.
