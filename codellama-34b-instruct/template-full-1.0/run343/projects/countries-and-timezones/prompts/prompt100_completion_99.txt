  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of property names of an object, rather than the object itself, which is the original behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of property values of an object, rather than the object itself, which is the original behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` converts a javascript object to a JSON string, which is not the original behavior of the code.

DONE.
