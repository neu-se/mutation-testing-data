 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `deferred.reject` function in an arrow function, which could change the context in which it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` resolves the deferred object with a value, rather than rejecting it with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the deferred object with a null value, rather than an error object. This could cause issues in code that expects an error object with a `message` and/or `stack` property.

DONE.
