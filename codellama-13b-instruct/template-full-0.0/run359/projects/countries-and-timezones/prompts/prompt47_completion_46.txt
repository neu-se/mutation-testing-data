  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would now return `null` instead of the country object. This would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return `null` instead of an array of timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would now return `undefined` instead of the country object. This would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return `undefined` instead of an array of timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would now return an empty object instead of the country object. This would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return an empty array instead of an array of timezones.

DONE.
