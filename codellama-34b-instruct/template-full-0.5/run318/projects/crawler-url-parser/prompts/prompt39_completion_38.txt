  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'ftp:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked for 'http:' and 'https:' protocols, while this code also checks for 'ftp:' protocol. If the URL has an 'ftp:' protocol, the original code would return null, while this code would return the parsed URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.host != 'example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked for 'http:' and 'https:' protocols, while this code also checks if the host is not 'example.com'. If the host is not 'example.com', the original code would return null, while this code would return the parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
