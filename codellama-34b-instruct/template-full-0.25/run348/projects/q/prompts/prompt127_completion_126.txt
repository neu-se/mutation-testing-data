  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `object_keys` function to return a different set of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `object_keys` function to return a different set of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `object_keys` function to return a different set of keys.

DONE.
