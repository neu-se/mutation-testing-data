  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the resulting promise to resolve with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the array, which would cause the resulting promise to resolve with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element from the array, which would cause the resulting promise to resolve with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
