Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_complete');
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a different event name ('write_complete') instead of 'write_close', which may not be handled by any listeners, leading to a lack of expected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', { success: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'write_close' event with an additional object containing a success property, which changes the event's payload and may cause listeners to behave differently based on the new structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Write stream closed unexpectedly'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an error event instead of a normal close event, which could trigger error handling logic in the application that would not have been executed with the original code.

DONE.
