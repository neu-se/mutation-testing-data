  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which could cause the `process.emit` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which could cause the `process.emit` function to be called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array and then attempt to remove one more element, which could cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
