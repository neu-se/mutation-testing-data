Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for finite numbers, causing the condition to pass for non-finite values (like `Infinity` or `NaN`), which would lead to incorrect handling of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number is an integer instead of checking for finiteness, which would incorrectly allow non-integer values (like fractions) to pass through the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the `arg` property is undefined instead of checking if `a['abs']` is finite, potentially allowing invalid complex number representations to be processed incorrectly.

DONE.
