  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because cos is a different function than cosh, and would produce a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.cos is a different function than cosh, and would produce a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because sin is a different function than cosh, and would produce a different output for the same input.

DONE.
