  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`1 + 1`
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + 1` returns `2`, which is not the same as `content`, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`content.trim()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.trim()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from `content`, which may cause the JSON parsing to fail if the whitespace is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`content.split('').reverse().join('')`
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the characters in `content`, which may cause the JSON parsing to fail if the order of the characters is important.

DONE.
