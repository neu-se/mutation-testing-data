  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, while this replacement uses a string literal to match the BOM. This could cause the `stripBom` function to incorrectly remove the BOM from a string that does not contain it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, while this replacement uses a string literal to match the BOM. This could cause the `stripBom` function to incorrectly remove the BOM from a string that does not contain it.
