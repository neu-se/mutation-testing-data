  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called with the correct `promise` parameter, leading to unhandled rejections not being properly tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a resolved promise, leading to a false sense of security that the rejection has been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a rejected promise, leading to a false sense of security that the rejection has been handled.

DONE.
