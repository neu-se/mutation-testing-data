  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `this`, which refers to the current element in the iteration, while the replacement code fragment uses `next()`, which refers to the next element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).closest('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `this`, which refers to the current element in the iteration, while the replacement code fragment uses `closest('a')`, which finds the closest ancestor element that matches the selector.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `this`, which refers to the current element in the iteration, while the replacement code fragment uses `find('a')`, which finds the descendants of the current element that match the selector.

DONE.
