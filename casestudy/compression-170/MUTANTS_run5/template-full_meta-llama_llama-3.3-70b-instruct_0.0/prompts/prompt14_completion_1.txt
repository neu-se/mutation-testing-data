Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a different status code in the response, potentially causing issues with the client's interpretation of the response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode === 200 ? 404 : res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would conditionally change the status code to 404 if the current status code is 200, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the client.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
req.method === 'GET' ? 201 : res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would conditionally change the status code to 201 if the request method is GET, potentially causing issues with the client's interpretation of the response.

DONE.
