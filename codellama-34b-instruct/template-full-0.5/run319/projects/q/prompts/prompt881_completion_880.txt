  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver(error)` to create a node-style callback that would throw an error if it was called with an error, but this new code fragment would simply reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver(error)` to create a node-style callback that would throw an error if it was called with an error, but this new code fragment would simply resolve the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver(error)` to create a node-style callback that would throw an error if it was called with an error, but this new code fragment would
