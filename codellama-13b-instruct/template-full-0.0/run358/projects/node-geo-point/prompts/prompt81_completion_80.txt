  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be incremented by 1, which would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted eastward.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be decremented by 1, which would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted westward.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be used instead of the longitude value, which would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted northward or southward depending on the latitude value.

DONE.
