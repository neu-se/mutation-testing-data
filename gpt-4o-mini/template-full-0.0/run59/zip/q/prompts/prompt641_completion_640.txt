Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a property from the object instead of invoking a method, leading to incorrect handling of method calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from invoking a method to applying a function, which may not be the intended action for the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to set a property on the object instead of invoking a method, which would likely cause errors or unexpected results when trying to call a method.

DONE.
