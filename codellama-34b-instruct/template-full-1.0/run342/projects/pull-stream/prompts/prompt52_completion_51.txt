Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.apply(this, [])
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method of the `Function` prototype, so `read` would need to be a function for this to work correctly. Additionally, the `()` operator is used to immediately invoke the function returned by `
