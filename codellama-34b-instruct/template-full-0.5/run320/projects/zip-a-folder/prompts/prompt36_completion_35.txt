  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('buggy code')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the string "buggy code" to the output stream, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write a null value to the output stream, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write an undefined value to the output stream, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
