  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is less than 0. This would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed even if there are still pending promises, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
