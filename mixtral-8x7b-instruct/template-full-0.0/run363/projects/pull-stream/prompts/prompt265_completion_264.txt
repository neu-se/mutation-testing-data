 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be returned instead of the actual data, potentially causing the downstream consumers to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the read function instead of the data, potentially causing the downstream consumers to fail or behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of the actual data, potentially causing the downstream consumers to fail or behave differently.

DONE.
