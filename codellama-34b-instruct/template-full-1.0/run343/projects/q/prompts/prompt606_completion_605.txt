  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function is used to resolve the promise with a value, while the `deferred.reject` function is used to reject the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function is used to resolve the promise with a value, while the `deferred.notify` function is used to notify progress and can be used to update the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function is used to resolve the promise with a value, while the `Q.fulfill` function is used to fulfill the promise with a value.

DONE.
