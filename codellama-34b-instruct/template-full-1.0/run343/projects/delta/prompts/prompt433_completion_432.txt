  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length returned by `Op.length` to be incremented by 1, which would affect the logic of the `if` statement that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length returned by `Op.length` to be decremented by 1, which would also affect the logic of the `if` statement that follows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, which would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
