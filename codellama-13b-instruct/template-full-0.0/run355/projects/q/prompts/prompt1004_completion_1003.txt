  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object, but with the arguments reversed. This would cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object, but with the arguments reversed. This would cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]
```
This would result
