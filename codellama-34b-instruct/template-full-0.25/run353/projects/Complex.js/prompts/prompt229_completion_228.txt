  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

DONE.
