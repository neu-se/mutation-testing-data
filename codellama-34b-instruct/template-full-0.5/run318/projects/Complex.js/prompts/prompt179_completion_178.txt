  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `c` is less than or equal to `d`, but the replacement code fragment is checking if `c` is less than `d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `c` is less than or equal to `d`, but the replacement code fragment is checking if `c` is less than or equal to `-d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `c` is less than or equal to `d`, but the replacement code fragment is checking if the absolute value of `c` is less than or equal to `d`.

DONE.
