  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.split(" ").join(""))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is logging the entire data object, while this mutation logs the data object split into an array of strings and then joined back into a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is logging the entire data object, while this mutation logs the data object in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is logging the entire data object, while this mutation logs the data object converted to uppercase.

DONE.
