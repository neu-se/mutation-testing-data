  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, whereas the original code only called `cb` with the `end` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` argument and a modified `data` argument, whereas the original code only called `cb` with the original `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end + 1, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a modified `end` argument and the original `data` argument, whereas the original code only called `cb` with the original `end` argument.

DONE.
