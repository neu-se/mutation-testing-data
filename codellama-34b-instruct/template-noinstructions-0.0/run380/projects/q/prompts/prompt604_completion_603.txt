  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(undefined)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by `Q.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q.nextTick)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(Q.nextTick)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `Q.nextTick`, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by `Q.nextTick`.

DONE.
