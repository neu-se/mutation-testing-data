  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This code fragment is also a buggy version of the original code, as it calls the `cb` function with `err` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it calls the `cb` function with `data` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
