Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a`, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the cosine of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the variable `a` with a constant value of Ï€, which would yield a fixed cosine value instead of the cosine of the actual real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the real part `a`, which would change the angle used in the cosine calculation, leading to incorrect results for the cosine of the complex number.

DONE.
