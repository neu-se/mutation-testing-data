  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it will cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `done`, and it will cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not the same as `null`, and it will cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument.

DONE.
