  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is a different method than `Math.exp` and would cause the `cosh` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is not a function that returns a value within the domain of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `Math.exp` function for the `cosh` function.

DONE.
