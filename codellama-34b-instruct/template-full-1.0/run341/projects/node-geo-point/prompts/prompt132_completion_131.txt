  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value for the `x` coordinate of the tile, causing the `toTile` method to return a different tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different zoom level to the `toTile` method, which would cause it to return a different tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toTile` method to throw a `NullPointerException`, as it expects a non-null object for its first parameter.

DONE.
