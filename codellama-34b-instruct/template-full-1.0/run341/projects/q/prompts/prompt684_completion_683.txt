  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array, while `array.slice` is a method that also returns a slice of an array, but it is not a function and cannot be used as a direct replacement for `array_slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice` is a method that returns a slice of an array, while `array_slice` is a function that also returns a slice of an array. Using `array.slice` as a direct replacement for `array_slice` would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice()` is a method that returns a slice of an array, while `array_slice` is a function that also returns a slice of an array. Using `array.slice()`
