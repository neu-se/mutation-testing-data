  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `data` value to the `acc` instead of using it as the accumulator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `data` value as the accumulator instead of the `acc` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `acc` value instead of using the `data` value as the accumulator.

DONE.
