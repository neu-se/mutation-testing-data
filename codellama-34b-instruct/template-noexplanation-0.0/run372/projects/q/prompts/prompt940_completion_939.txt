  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it skips the first argument in the `arguments` object. This could cause the `nodeArgs` array to be missing the first argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `Q.denodeify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it excludes the last argument in the `arguments` object. This could cause the `nodeArgs` array to be missing the last argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `Q.denodeify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, arguments.length - 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it skips the first and last arguments in the `arguments` object. This could cause the
