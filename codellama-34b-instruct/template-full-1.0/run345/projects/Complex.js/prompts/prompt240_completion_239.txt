  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the term `-a` reduces the degree of the polynomial, which could cause a test case to pass unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the term `3` would increase the degree of the polynomial, which could cause a test case to fail unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a` and `b` would change the semantics of the code, potentially causing unexpected behavior in some cases.

DONE.
