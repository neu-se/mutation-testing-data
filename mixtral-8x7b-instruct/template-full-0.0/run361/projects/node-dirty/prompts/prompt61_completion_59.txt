 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.unlinkSync(this.path);
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the file instead of closing the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because it pauses the read stream instead of closing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the readStream to null without closing it.

DONE.
