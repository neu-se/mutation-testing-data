  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.random() generates a random number between 0 and 1, which is unlikely to be the desired bearing for the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination bearing as 90 degrees more than the actual bearing, resulting in a very different location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination bearing as twice the actual bearing, resulting in a much larger distance between the starting point and the destination point.

DONE.
