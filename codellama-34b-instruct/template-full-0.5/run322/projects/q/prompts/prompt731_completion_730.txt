  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress value would be doubled, which could cause the progress notification to be sent at the wrong time or with the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress value would be incremented by 1, which could cause the progress notification to be sent at the wrong time or with the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress value would be decremented by 1, which could cause the progress notification to be sent at the wrong time or with the wrong value.

DONE.
