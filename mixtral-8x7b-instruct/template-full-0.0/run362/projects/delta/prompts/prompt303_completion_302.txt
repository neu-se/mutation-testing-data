 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next().attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is being accessed directly from the result of `iter.next()`, which might not have an `attributes` property, and if it doesn't, it will return `undefined`. The original code uses a default value of `{}` in case `attributes` is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is being accessed directly from the result of `iter.next()`, which might not have an `insert` property, and if it doesn't, it will return `undefined`. The original code uses a default value of `NULL_CHARACTER` in case `insert` is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next().retain || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the
