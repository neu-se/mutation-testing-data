  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    throw new Error("Oh no!");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, but it is not passed a function to execute when the promise is resolved. Instead, it is passed a function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, but it is not passed a function to execute when the promise is resolved. Instead, it is passed a function that returns the value of the promise multiplied by 2, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
