  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional branch that is triggered when the `abort` signal is received. In the original code, the `if` statement checks `!busy`, which means that the code inside the `if` block will only be executed when the async map is not busy. By changing the conditional to `busy`, the code inside the `if` block will only be executed when the async map is busy, which could cause the async map to fail to abort properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional branch that is triggered when the `abort` signal is received. In the original code, the `if` statement checks `!aborted`, which means that the code inside the `if` block will only be executed when the map is not aborted. By changing the conditional to `aborted`, the code inside the `if` block will only be executed when the map is aborted, which could cause the async
