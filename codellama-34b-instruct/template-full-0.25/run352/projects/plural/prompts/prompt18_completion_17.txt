  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag would cause the regular expression to ignore case, so it would match "ch" and "s" even if they are in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag would cause the regular expression to match across multiple lines, so it would match "ch" and "s" even if they are on different lines.

DONE.
