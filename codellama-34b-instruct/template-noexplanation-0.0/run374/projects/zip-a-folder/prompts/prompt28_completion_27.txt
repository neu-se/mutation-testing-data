  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This change will cause the `output` stream to emit an `'end'` event instead of a `'close'` event, which may cause the `zipArchive.finalize()` method to be called before the `output` stream is fully written, leading to a buggy behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This change will cause the `output` stream to emit an `'error'` event instead of a `'close'` event, which may cause the `zipArchive.finalize()` method to be called with an error, leading to a buggy behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This change will cause the `output` stream to emit a `'finish'` event instead of a `'close'` event, which may cause the `zipArchive.finalize()` method to be called before the `output` stream is fully written, leading to a buggy behavior.

DONE.
