 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would not be called on the promise, and the `promise` object would not be replaced with its resolved value. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing the resolved values in the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise()` check would return false, and the `snapshot` variable would not be assigned. As a result, the `promises` array would not be updated with the resolved value, and the `pendingCount` would not be decremented. This could lead to incorrect handling of resolved promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise()` check would return true, but the `snapshot` variable would be assigned a function object instead of a promise object. This would cause
