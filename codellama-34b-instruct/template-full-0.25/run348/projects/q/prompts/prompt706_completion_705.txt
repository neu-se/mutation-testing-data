  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays or array-like objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays or array-like objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays or array
