  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that should be passed as an argument to the `cb` function, while `null` is a constant value that will not be accepted as an argument by the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different constant value than `null`, and it will also not be accepted as an argument by the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `null` or `undefined`, and it will be treated as a valid argument by the `cb` function, but it will also have a different behavior than the original code fragment `acc` which is a variable that should be passed as an argument to the `cb` function.

DONE.
