  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because "`null`" is not equivalent to "`void 0`", and would cause the `fail` method to resolve with `null` instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, null
```
This would result in different behavior because "`undefined`" is not equivalent to "`void 0`", and would cause the `fail` method to resolve with `null` instead of rejecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
alert("error!"), rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fail` method to call the `alert` function with the message "error!" instead of rejecting.

DONE.
