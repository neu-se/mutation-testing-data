  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to the `set` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to the `set` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to the `set` method, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
