 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.includes()` is used instead of `array_indexOf()`. The `includes()` method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning `true` or `false` as the result. On the other hand, `array_indexOf()` returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or `-1` if it is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.some(p => p === promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.some()` is used to check if at least one element in the array satisfies the provided testing function. In this case, it checks if the current element is equal to the `promise`. If at least one element passes the test, the `some()` method will return `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`.
