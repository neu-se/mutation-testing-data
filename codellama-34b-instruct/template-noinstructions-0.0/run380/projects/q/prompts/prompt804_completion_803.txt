  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called with the correct `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called with the correct `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called with the correct `this` context.

DONE.
