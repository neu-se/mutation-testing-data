  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, unlike `value`, which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `value` is an object with properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that represents an unset value, while `value` is an object with properties and methods.

DONE.
