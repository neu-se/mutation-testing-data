  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cero'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'cellos'` returns the plural form of the word `'cello'`, while the new code fragment `'cero'` returns the plural form of the word `'zero'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'cellos'` returns the plural form of the word `'cello'`, while the new code fragment `'celli'` returns the plural form of the word `'celli'` (which is not a word in English).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cels'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'cellos'` returns the plural form of the word `'cello'`, while the new code fragment `'cels'` returns the plural form of the word `'cel'`.

DONE.
