  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `acc` is the initial value of the accumulator, but replacing it with `null` would cause the accumulator to be initialized to `null`, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `acc` is the initial value of the accumulator, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the accumulator to be initialized to `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `acc` is the initial value of the accumulator, but replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the accumulator to be initialized to an empty object, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
