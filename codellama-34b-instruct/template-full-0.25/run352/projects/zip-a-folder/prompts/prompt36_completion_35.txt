  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output.write);
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write` is a function that takes a string or buffer as an argument, whereas `output` is a writable stream that can be piped to directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output.end);
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end` is a function that signals the end of the stream, whereas `output` is a writable stream that can be piped to directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output.destroy);
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.destroy` is a function that destroys the stream, whereas `output` is a writable stream that can be piped to directly.

DONE.
