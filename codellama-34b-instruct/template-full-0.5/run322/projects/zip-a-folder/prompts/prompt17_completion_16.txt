  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the targetBasePath, potentially creating a new directory or file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first part of the targetBasePath, potentially creating a new directory or file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the targetBasePath, potentially creating a new directory or file.

DONE.
