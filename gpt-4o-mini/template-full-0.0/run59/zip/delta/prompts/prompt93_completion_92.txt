Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the new operation to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end, which changes the order of operations and could lead to incorrect results when processing the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push({ ...newOp, insert: null });
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a new operation with the `insert` property set to `null`, which may lead to unexpected behavior when the operations are processed, as it effectively removes the intended insertion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index + 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the new operation at the position after the current index instead of the current index, which could disrupt the intended sequence of operations and lead to incorrect processing of the operations.

DONE.
