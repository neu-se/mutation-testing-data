 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function* () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty generator function, instead of using the provided `makeGenerator` function. This would cause the `spawn` function to always return an immediately resolved promise, without executing the intended generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `makeGenerator` parameter with an integer value. This would cause a syntax error in the `async` function, as it expects a function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
makeGenerator.apply(null, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the `makeGenerator` function immediately with no arguments, rather than wrapping it in a function and deferring its execution. This would cause the `spawn` function to always return a promise that is immediately resolved with the result of invoking `makeGenerator`, instead of
