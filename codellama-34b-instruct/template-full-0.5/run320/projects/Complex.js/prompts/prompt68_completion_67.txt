  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an object with properties 're' and 'im', while this replacement would return a single value, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'] + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an object with properties 're' and 'im', while this replacement would return a single value that is one greater than the original value, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an object with properties 're' and 'im', while this replacement would return a single value that is twice the original value, which is not what the function is intended to do.

DONE.
