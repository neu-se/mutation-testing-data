  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in an object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the iteration at the last element of the array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the original array except the first one, whereas the original code fragment returns a new array containing all elements of the original array.

DONE.
