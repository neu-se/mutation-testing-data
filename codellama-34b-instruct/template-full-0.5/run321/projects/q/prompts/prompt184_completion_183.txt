  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a function that converts its argument to a number, while the replaced code fragment `"string"` is a string literal that would cause a type error when used as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a function that converts its argument to a number, while the replaced code fragment `null` is a null value that would cause a type error when used as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a function that converts its argument to a number, while the replaced code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value that would cause a type error when used as a function.

DONE.
