 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would always be 42, instead of the original promise's resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject('Error')
