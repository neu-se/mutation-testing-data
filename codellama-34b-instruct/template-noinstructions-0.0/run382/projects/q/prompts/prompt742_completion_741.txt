  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` and `onProgress` callbacks would not be called for rejections or progress notifications.

DONE.
