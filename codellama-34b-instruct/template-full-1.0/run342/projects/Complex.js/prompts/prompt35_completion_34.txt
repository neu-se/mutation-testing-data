  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `a` is `0`, not `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `false` if `b` is `0`, not `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a%b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `a` is divisible by `b`, not `a === 0`.

DONE.
