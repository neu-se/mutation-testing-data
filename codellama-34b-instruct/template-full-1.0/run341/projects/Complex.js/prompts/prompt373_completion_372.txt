  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.cos` function, which expects a number as input and returns its cosine value. Replacing it with `-b` would result in the opposite sign of the value of `b`, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.cos` function, which expects a single number as input and returns its cosine value. Replacing it with `a + b` would result in a different value than the original code, potentially leading to incorrect calculations and unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.cos` function, which expects a single number as input and returns its cosine value. Replacing
