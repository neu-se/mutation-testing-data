Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operations starting from the next index instead of the current index, potentially skipping the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to slice the operations from the previous index, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or unexpected results if the index is already at the start.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the operations starting from the beginning of the array, ignoring the current index and offset, which could lead to incorrect results when trying to get the remaining operations.

DONE.
