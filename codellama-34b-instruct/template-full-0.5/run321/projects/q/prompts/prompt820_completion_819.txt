  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is reversed, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback is called instead of the `fulfilled` callback, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, progress, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback is called instead of the `progress` callback, causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
