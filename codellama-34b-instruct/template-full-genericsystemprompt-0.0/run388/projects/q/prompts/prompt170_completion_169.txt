  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1 ||

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the string "(node.js:" in the line, which is not the same as checking for the presence of the string "module.js:".
