  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'ves', regardless of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 's', regardless of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 1) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the input word with the last character removed and 'es' added to the end, regardless of the input word.

DONE.
