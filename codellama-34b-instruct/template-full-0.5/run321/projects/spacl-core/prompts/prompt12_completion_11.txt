  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `match` method to check if the `spec` string contains any invalid characters, while the new code fragment is splitting the `spec` string into an array of individual characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `match` method to check if the `spec` string contains any invalid characters, while the new code fragment is checking if the `spec` string includes the `:` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.startsWith(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `match` method to check if the `spec` string contains any invalid characters, while the new code fragment is checking if the `spec` string starts with the `:` character.

DONE.
