 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffsetStr` property will always be a string with the value '0', regardless of the actual UTC offset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffsetStr` property will always have a positive value, even if the original `utcOffset` value is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getOffsetStr(Math.abs(utcOffset))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffsetStr` property will always have a positive value and use the format '+hh:mm', even if the original `utcOffset` value is negative.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process aims to reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite, encouraging developers to improve their tests and ensure comprehensive code coverage.
