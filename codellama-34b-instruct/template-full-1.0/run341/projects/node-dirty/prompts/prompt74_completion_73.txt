  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because the getter method `emit` is not defined for the `ReadStream` class, whereas the `WriteStream` class does have an `emit` method defined. Using `this._writeStream.emit` would therefore result in a `TypeError` exception being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not defined for the `WriteStream` class, whereas the `ReadStream` class does have an `emit` method defined. Using `this._readStream.emit` would therefore result in a `TypeError` exception being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not defined for the `WriteStream` class, whereas the `ReadStream` class does have an `emit`
