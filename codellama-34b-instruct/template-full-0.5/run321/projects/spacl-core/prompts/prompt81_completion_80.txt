  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the path to lowercase, which could potentially cause the rule to match a different path than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` would split the path into an array of substrings, which could potentially cause the rule to match a different path than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` would remove all forward slashes from the path, which could potentially cause the rule to match a different path than expected.

DONE.
