  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would be called with `null` as an argument, leading to a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would be called with an empty array as an argument, leading to an empty array being returned.

DONE.
