  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would cause the imaginary part of the complex number to be negated, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the imaginary part of the complex number to be incremented by 1, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the imaginary part of the complex number to be multiplied by 2, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
