  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the key from the map, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with `undefined` as the value would set the value associated with the key to `undefined`, whereas `delete` would remove the key from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with `null` as the value would set the value associated with the key to `null`, whereas `delete` would remove the key from the map.

DONE.
