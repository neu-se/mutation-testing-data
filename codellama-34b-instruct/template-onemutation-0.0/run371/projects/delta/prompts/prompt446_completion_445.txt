  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the `Op` object, but subtracting 1 from it would result in an incorrect value, which could cause the `peekLength` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
