  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is no longer checked for a specific value, but rather for any non-200 status code. This could cause the code to reject a request that was actually successful, or to accept a request that failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is now checked for two different values, 200 and 300. This could cause the code to reject a request that was actually successful, or to accept a request that failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 || res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is now checked for two different values, 200 and 300, using a logical OR
