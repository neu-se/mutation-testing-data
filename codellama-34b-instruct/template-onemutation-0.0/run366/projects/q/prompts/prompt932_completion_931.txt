  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In the context of the code, `void 0` is used to indicate that the function should not return any value, whereas `null` would return a null value.

DONE.
