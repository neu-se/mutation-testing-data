 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from `===` to `=`, which would always evaluate to true and could lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from `===` to `==`, which performs type coercion and could lead to unexpected results in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from `===` to `!==`, which would always evaluate to false if the operands are of the same type and value, and could lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
