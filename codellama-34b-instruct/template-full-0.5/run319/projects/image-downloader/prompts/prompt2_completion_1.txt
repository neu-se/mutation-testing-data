  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an iterable have resolved, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects when the first promise in an iterable resolves or rejects, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
