  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block even if `c` is not equal to `'+'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block only if `c` is equal to `'-'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block only if `c` is equal to `'*'`.

DONE.
