Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify cases where the imaginary part is very small (but not zero) as significant, leading to a string representation that includes a non-zero imaginary part when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the imaginary part to be zero if it is exactly equal to the value of `Complex['EPSILON']`, which is a very specific condition and would fail for any small values of `b` that are not exactly equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly set `b` to zero only when `b` is negative, ignoring positive values and zero, which would lead to an incorrect string representation of the complex number.

DONE.
