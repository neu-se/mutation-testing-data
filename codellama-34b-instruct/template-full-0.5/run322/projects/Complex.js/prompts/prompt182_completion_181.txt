  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `isZero` property of `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)

This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `isZero` property of `z`.
