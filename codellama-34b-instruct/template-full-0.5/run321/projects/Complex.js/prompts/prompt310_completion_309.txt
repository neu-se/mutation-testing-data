  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the complex number with a different angle, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the complex number with a different angle, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the complex number with a different angle, leading to a different result.

DONE.
