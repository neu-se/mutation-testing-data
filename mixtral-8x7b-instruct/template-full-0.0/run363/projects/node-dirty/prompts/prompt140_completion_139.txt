 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` sends an event to the Node.js process rather than the Dirty object, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.emit
