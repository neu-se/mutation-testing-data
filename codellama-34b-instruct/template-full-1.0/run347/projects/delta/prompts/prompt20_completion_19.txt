  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the objects being concatenated, which could affect the final result of the `compose` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `b` parameter to null, which would override the existing value and potentially change the behavior of the `compose` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `b` parameter to an empty object, which would change the behavior of the `compose` function when trying to access properties that are only defined in the original `b` object.

DONE.
