 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap` object will end up having `null` values for some keys, which might not be expected in the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap` object will end up having empty objects for some keys, which might not be expected in the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function() { return { url: currentUrl.url, text: text, type: 'unknown' } })()
```
This would result in different behavior because a self-invoking function is introduced, which can lead to unexpected behavior or scope issues. In this case, it might return an object with `type: 'unknown'` for some entries, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
