  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Test error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the program to crash, whereas the original code would have continued executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Test string"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string, whereas the original code would have returned a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return undefined, whereas the original code would have returned a function.

DONE.
