  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `this` was infinite, while the new code fragment is checking if `z` is infinite. This could cause the function to return a different result, depending on the value of `z`.

DONE.
