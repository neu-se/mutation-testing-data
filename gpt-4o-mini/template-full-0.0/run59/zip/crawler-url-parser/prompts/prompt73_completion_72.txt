Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data-href'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve the value of a non-existent `data-href` attribute instead of the `href` attribute, potentially leading to `undefined` being parsed as a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for an attribute named `href2`, which does not exist, causing the `embedBaseUrlStr` to be `undefined` and potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href.toString()'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call `toString()` on the string 'href', which is not a valid operation, leading to a runtime error instead of retrieving the attribute value.

DONE.
