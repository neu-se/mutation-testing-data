  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, rather than the `baseOp` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, rather than the `baseOp` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, rather than the `baseOp` object itself.

DONE.
