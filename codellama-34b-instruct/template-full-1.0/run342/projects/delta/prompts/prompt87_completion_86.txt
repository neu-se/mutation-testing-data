  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes, newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the second occurrence of `newOp.attributes` would refer to the attributes of the current operation, rather than the attributes of the last operation as intended.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes, newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the second occurrence of `lastOp.attributes` would refer to the attributes of the previous operation, rather than the attributes of the current operation as intended.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` would return the total number of operations in the delta, rather than the attributes of the last operation as intended.

DONE.
