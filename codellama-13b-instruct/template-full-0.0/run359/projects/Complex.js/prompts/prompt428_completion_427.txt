  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 0 would cause the places variable to be set to 0, which would then be used in the Math.pow() function, resulting in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the places variable to be set to 1, which would then be used in the Math.pow() function, resulting in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 would cause the places variable to be set to -1, which would then be used in the Math.pow() function, resulting in a different value being returned.

DONE.
