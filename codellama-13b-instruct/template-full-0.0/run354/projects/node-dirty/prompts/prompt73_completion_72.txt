  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` when the file does not exist, which would cause the `error` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EEXIST'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` when the file already exists, which would cause the `error` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` when the file is a directory, which would cause the `error` event to be emitted.

DONE.
