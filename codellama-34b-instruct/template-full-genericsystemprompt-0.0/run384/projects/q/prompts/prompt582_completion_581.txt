  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function with the `continuer` function as its first argument, which would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", "error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function with the `continuer` function as its first argument, the string "error" as its second argument, and the `throw` function as its third argument, which would cause an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", "error", "message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function with the `cont
