  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the index of the current element in the loop to the `keys` array, rather than the element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of the current element in the loop to the `keys` array, rather than the element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index].toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the string representation of the current element in the loop to the `keys` array, rather than the element itself.

DONE.
