  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!timezonesMap` checks if the `timezonesMap` is falsy, while `timezonesMap === undefined` checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`. If the `timezonesMap` is any other falsy value (e.g. `null`, `false`, `0`), the original code would still execute the `if` block, but the modified code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!timezonesMap` checks if the `timezonesMap` is falsy, while `timezonesMap.length === 0` checks if it is an empty array. If the `timezonesMap` is an empty object or any other falsy value, the original code would still execute the `if` block, but the modified code would not.

Option 3:
