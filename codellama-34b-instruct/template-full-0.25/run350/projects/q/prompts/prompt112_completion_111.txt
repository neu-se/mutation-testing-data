  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` argument would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` argument would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` argument would be different.

DONE.
