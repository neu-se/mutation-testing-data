  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `typeof b !== 'undefined'` checks if `b` is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b == null` checks if `b` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b.constructor !== Object` checks if `b` is not an instance of `Object`.

DONE.
