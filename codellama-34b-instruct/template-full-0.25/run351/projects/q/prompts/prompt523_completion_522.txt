  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch.call(this, "next", arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch.call` would call the `next` method on the `dispatch` object, which is not the same as calling the `next` method on the `generator` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.next(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next` method on the `generator` object directly, without going through the `dispatch` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.throw(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `throw` method on the `generator` object, which would cause the generator to throw an exception, rather than returning a promise.

DONE.
