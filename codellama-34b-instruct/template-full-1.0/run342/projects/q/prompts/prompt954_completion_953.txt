  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given error, while `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that returns a promise, while `undefined` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Deferred` is a different class than `deferred`, and `Deferred.resolve` is not a function.

DONE.
