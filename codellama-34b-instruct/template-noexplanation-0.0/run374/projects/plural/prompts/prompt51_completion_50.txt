  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra 's' to the end of the word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it removes the last character of the word before adding 'es', which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it removes the last two characters of the word before adding 'es', which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
