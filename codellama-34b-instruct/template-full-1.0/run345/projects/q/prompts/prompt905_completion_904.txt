  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` modifies the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the callback to be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array, which could cause the callback to be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.map(function(arg) {return arg * 2;})
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array with each element modified by the callback, which could cause the callback to be called with incorrect arguments.

DONE.
