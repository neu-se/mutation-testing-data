  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `latitude === 0` would cause the constructor to throw an error when the latitude is equal to 0, which is a valid value for latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `longitude === 0` would cause the constructor to throw an error when the longitude is equal to 0, which is a valid value for longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || Math.abs(latitude) > 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `Math.abs(latitude) > 90` would cause the constructor to throw an error when the absolute value of the latitude is greater
