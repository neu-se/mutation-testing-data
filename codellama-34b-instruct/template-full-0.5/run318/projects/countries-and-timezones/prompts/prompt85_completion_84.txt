  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a string instead of the expected country object.

DONE.
