  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
