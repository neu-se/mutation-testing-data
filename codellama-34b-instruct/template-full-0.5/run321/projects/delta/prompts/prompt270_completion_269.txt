  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const delta = new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object instead of concatenating two existing `Delta` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const other = new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object instead of using the existing `other` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const delta = other;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `other` object to the `delta` variable, which would cause the `delta` object to be mutated instead of creating a new object.

DONE.
