 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<PLACEHOLDER>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always write to the file with the name '<PLACEHOLDER>', instead of the intended `file` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write to the current working directory instead of the intended `file` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number and use it as the filename, instead of the intended `file` variable.

DONE.
