  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null.inspect() is not a function, whereas this.inspect() is a function that returns an object representing the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined.inspect() is not a function, whereas this.inspect() is a function that returns an object representing the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because {}.inspect() is not a function, whereas this.inspect() is a function that returns an object representing the state of the promise.

DONE.
