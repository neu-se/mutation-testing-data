  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` will replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string, whereas `replace` will only replace the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^/, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the pattern `/^/` will match the beginning of the string, whereas `replaceAll` will match all occurrences of the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^/m, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the pattern `/^/m` will match the beginning of the string and the `m` flag will make the match multi-line, whereas `replaceAll` will only match a single line.

DONE.
