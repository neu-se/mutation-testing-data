  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by 2, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
