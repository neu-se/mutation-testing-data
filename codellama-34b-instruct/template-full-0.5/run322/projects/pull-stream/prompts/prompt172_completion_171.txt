  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `array` parameter is not an array, while this new code checks if it is an array. This change would cause the function to return a different value if the `array` parameter is not an array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `array` parameter is not an array, while this new code checks if the `array` parameter has a length greater than 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value if the `array` parameter is not an array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `array` parameter is not an array, while
