Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an error as the first argument to the callback instead of `null`, indicating that an error occurred, which would change the expected flow of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data` as the first argument to the callback instead of `null`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the data by the consumer of the callback, as it would imply that the operation completed successfully with the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to the callback instead of `null`, which may lead to confusion or errors in the callback handling, as the consumer might interpret `undefined` differently than `null`.

DONE.
