  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(z['re']) && !isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isNaN` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `re` or `im` property of `z` is not a number, rather than when it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) || isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks whether a value is a finite number, rather than whether it is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== z['re'] || z['im'] !== z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks whether two values are not equal, rather than whether they are equal.

DONE.
