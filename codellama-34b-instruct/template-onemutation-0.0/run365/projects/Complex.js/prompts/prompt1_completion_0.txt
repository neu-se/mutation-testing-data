  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. In the context of the code, `Math.floor` would cause the function to return a value that is always less than or equal to the actual value, which could result in incorrect calculations and errors. DONE.
