  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `messages` is defined, while this new code fragment checks if `messages` is equal to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `messages` is defined, while this new code fragment checks if `messages` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `messages` is defined, while this new code fragment checks if the length of `messages` is greater than 0.

DONE.
