Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument instead of the first argument being included, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the `thisp` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method of slicing the arguments, which could lead to unexpected results if the context of `arguments` is not preserved correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument instead of converting the entire `arguments` object into an array, which would break the intended functionality of passing multiple arguments.

DONE.
