  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, whereas the original code doesn't specify any arguments to `deferred.reject`, which means it will be rejected with a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined`, whereas the original code doesn't specify any arguments to `deferred.reject`, which means it will be rejected with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error object, whereas the original code doesn't specify any arguments to `deferred.reject`, which means it will be rejected with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
