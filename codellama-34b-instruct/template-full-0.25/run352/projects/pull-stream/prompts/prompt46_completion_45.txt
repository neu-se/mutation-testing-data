  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the loop to execute one fewer time than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last index of the array instead of the first, which could cause the loop to execute one fewer time than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle index of the array instead of the first, which could cause the loop to execute one fewer time than expected.

DONE.
