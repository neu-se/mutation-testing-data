Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("Error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of propagating the caught exception, it creates a new rejected promise with a static error message, which may not provide the original error context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the generator with a constant value (42) instead of propagating the original exception, leading to a successful resolution instead of an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve("Handled exception");
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a fixed string message instead of rejecting it, thus masking the original error and changing the flow of error handling in the promise chain.

DONE.
