  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method expects an `Op` object as an argument, but `null` is not an `Op` object. The original code would have pushed a new `Op` object onto the `ops` array, but the modified code would push `null` onto the array, which is not an `Op` object and may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method expects an `Op` object as an argument, but the modified code would push the last element of the `ops` array onto the array again, which is not the same as pushing a new `Op` object. This could cause the `ops` array to have duplicate elements or alter the order of the elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior
