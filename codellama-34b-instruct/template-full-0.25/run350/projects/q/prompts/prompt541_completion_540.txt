  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `then` method. In the original code, `value` is passed to `Q.all()`, which expects an array of promises. If `value` is `null`, `Q.all()` will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `then` method. In the original code, `value` is passed to `Q.all()`, which expects an array of promises. If `value` is `undefined`, `Q.all()` will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which is not a promise. In the original code, `value` is passed to `Q.
