  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS && process.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because process.exit() would cause the Node.js process to exit, whereas the original code would merely exit the current domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS && process.kill();
```
This would result in different behavior because process.kill() would cause the Node.js process to terminate, whereas the original code would merely exit the current domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS && process.abort();
```
This would result in different behavior because process.abort() would cause the Node.js process to terminate, whereas the original code would merely exit the current domain.

DONE.
