  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is not defined in the context of the code snippet, and will therefore result in a reference error. In contrast, `Q` is a function that is defined in the code snippet and is used to create a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that is defined in the code snippet and is used to resolve a promise. In contrast, `Q` is a function that is defined in the code snippet and is used to create a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that is defined in the code snippet and is used to reject a promise. In contrast, `Q` is a function that is defined in the code snippet and is used to create a promise.

DONE.
