  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "https", which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." subdomain from the URL, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("https://", "http://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "https" to "http", which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

DONE.
