  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 5}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value stored in the database, causing the database to become corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key: key + '_suffix', val: this._data.get(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key used to store the value in the database, causing the database to become corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) || null}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value with null if it's falsy, which would cause the database to become corrupted.

DONE.
