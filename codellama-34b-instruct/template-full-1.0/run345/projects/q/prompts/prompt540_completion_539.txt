  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects the context object as the first argument, whereas `apply` expects an array or list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the specified context and arguments, whereas `apply` and `call` directly invokes the function with the specified context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the number of arguments expected by the function, whereas `apply` and `call` can take any number of arguments.

DONE.
