Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the transformation to use the `otherData` instead of `thisData`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when merging operations from two different `Delta` instances.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a specific property of `thisData` based on `embedType`, which may not exist, leading to undefined behavior or errors during the transformation process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the expected object with `null`, causing the transformation logic to fail when it tries to access properties or methods on `null`, likely resulting in a runtime error.

DONE.
