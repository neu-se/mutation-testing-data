  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is now converted to lowercase before being passed to the `query` method, which could potentially affect the outcome of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is now converted to uppercase before being passed to the `query` method, which could potentially affect the outcome of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is now trimmed before being passed to the `query` method, which could potentially affect the outcome of the method.

DONE.
