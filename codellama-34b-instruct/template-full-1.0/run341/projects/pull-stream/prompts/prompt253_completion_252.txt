  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` would be called instead of `nextChunk`, which would cause the code to enter the `nextStream` function instead of the `nextChunk` function, resulting in a different control flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === false) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `err === false` is always false, so the `nextStream` function would never be called, even if `err` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err && false) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `err && false` is always false, so the `nextStream` function would never be called, even if `err` is truthy.

DONE.
