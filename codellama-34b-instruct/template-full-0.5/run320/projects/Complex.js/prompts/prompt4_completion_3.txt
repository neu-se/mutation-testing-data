  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the positive value of `x`, while the replaced code fragment uses the negative value of `x`. This could cause the function to return a different result, especially if the value of `x` is large.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` as is, while the replaced code fragment squares the value of `x`. This could cause the function to return a different result, especially if the value of `x` is large.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` as is, while the replaced code fragment takes the square root of `x`. This could cause the function to return a different result, especially if the value of `x` is large.

DONE.
