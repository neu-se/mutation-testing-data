  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to receive a different argument, which would change the result of the `pow` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to receive a different argument, which would change the result of the `pow` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to receive a different argument, which would change the result of the `pow` function.

DONE.
