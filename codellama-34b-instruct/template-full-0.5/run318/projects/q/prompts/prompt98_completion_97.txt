  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate if the `index` variable is greater than 0, as the loop would continue to decrement the `index` variable indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate if the `index` variable is greater than 0, as the loop would continue to reset the `index` variable to 0 indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or to never terminate at all.

DONE.
