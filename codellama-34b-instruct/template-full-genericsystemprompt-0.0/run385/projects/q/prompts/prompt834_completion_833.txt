  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, "extra argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the `then` method, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra function is added to the `then` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
