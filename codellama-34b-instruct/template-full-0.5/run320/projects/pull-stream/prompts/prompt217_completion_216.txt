  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is called when the map function is aborted, whereas `cb` is a callback function that is called when the map function is completed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `err` parameter of the map function, whereas `cb` is a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a boolean value that indicates whether the map function has been aborted, whereas `cb` is a callback function.

DONE.
