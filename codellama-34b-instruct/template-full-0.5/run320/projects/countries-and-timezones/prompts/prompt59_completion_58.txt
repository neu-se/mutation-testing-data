  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the function to return a different value, which would affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the function to return a different value, which would affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the function to return a different value, which would affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
