  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the promise being resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return without resolving or rejecting the promise, which would cause the promise to remain pending indefinitely.

DONE.
