  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and return its promise, rather than returning the promise of the original deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() { return Q.defer(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and return its promise, rather than returning the promise of the original deferred object. Additionally, it would create a new promise chain, which could cause issues if the original code relied on the specific behavior of the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and return its promise, rather than returning the promise of the original deferred object. Additionally, it would reject the promise, which could
