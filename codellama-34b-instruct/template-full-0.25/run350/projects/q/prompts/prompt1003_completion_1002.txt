  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be passed as the first argument to `dispatch`, instead of the `name` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be passed in reverse order to `dispatch`, which could cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments in a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat(["extra argument"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to `dispatch`, which could cause issues if the function being called does not expect extra arguments.

DONE.
