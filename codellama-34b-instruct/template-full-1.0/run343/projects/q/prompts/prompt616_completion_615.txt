  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is not a member of `Promise` and would return an undefined reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a member of `Promise` and would return an undefined reference.

DONE.
