Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore all additional arguments passed to the function, potentially leading to unexpected results when the function is called with more than one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the number of arguments instead of the arguments themselves, which would not be valid for the intended use of the function and could lead to runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array containing all arguments, rather than just the arguments starting from index 1, which would change the expected input for the subsequent function calls.

DONE.
