  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises x to the power of e, while the new code fragment raises -x to the power of e, which would result in a negative value being raised to a power, which is not defined for real numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises x to the power of e, while the new code fragment raises x plus 1 to the power of e, which would result in a different value being raised to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises x to the power of e, while the new code fragment raises 2x to the power of e, which would result in a different value being raised to a power.

DONE.
