Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `.fail` (which handles errors) to `.then`, which is intended for handling successful resolutions, potentially causing unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("send", [name, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `"post"` to `"send"`, which may not be a valid method for the object, leading to a failure in dispatching the intended action.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument `"extraArg"` to the dispatch call, which could alter the expected behavior of the method being called, potentially causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
