  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This code fragment will match both "http://" and "https://" protocols, which is more inclusive than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\/(?!localhost)/
```
This code fragment will match both "http://" and "https://" protocols, but will not match "localhost" as a hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\/(?!localhost|127\.0\.0\.1)/
```
This code fragment will match both "http://" and "https://" protocols, but will not match "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" as a hostname.

DONE.
