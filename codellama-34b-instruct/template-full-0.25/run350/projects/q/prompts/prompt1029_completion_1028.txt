  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not equal to `null`, and would therefore cause the `nodeback` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a primitive value that is not equal to `null`, and would therefore cause the `nodeback` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a primitive value that is not equal to `null`, and would therefore cause the `nodeback` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
