  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise and would cause `when` to immediately reject, even if the promise eventually resolves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a promise and would cause `when` to immediately resolve to 0, even if the promise eventually rejects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` creates a rejected promise that would cause `when` to immediately reject, even if the promise eventually resolves.

DONE.
