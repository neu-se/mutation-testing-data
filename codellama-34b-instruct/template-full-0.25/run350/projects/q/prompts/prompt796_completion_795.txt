  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, function (value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with the wrong value.

DONE.
