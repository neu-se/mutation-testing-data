  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the argument of the `logHypot` function by 1, which would affect the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the argument of the `logHypot` function with the variable `b`, which is a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the argument of the `logHypot` function by the variable `b`, which would affect the result of the function.

DONE.
