  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nearerValue` is a promise, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nearerValue` is a promise, while this replacement checks if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nearerValue` is a promise, while this replacement checks if it is the string 'foo'.

DONE.
