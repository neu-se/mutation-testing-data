 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object's promise would be resolved immediately, instead of waiting for all the input promises to be settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object's promise would be rejected immediately, regardless of the input promises' states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
  throw new Error('Intentional error');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object's promise would be rejected with an error, instead of being resolved when all input promises are settled.

DONE.
