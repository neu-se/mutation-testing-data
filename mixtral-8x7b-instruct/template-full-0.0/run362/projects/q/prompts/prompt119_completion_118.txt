 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. On the other hand, `uncurryThis` just calls the function with the provided `this` value and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString
