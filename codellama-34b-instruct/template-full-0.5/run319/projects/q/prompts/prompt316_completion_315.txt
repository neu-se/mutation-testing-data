  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` instead of `false`, which would cause the `inspect` function to be executed, even if it was not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect == void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `inspect` function to be skipped, even if it was defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `inspect` function to be skipped, even if it was defined.

DONE.
