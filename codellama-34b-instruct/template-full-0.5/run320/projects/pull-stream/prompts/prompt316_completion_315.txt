  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would terminate the read stream, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would terminate the read stream with an error, while the new code fragment `cb(new Error('Test error'))` would pass a different error to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would terminate the read stream, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would not.

DONE.
