This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function and remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(reason); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the same reason as the original promise, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function and remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("rejected")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function and remove
