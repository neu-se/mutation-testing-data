  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = definition(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export a different value than the original code, which could potentially break any code that relies on the module's exports.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = definition(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export a different value than the original code, which could potentially break any code that relies on the module's exports.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = definition(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export a different value than the original code, which could potentially break any code that relies on the module's exports.

DONE.
