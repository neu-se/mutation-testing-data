  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if an object has a property called `attributes`, while this modified code checks if the property is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if an object has a property called `attributes`, while this modified code checks if the property is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if an object has a property called `attributes`, while this modified code checks if the property is an array and if the first element is truthy.

DONE.
