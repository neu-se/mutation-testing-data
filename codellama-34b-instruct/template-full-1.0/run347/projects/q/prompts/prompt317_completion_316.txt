  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have the same properties or methods as `object_create`, which is a function that creates a new object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object literal and does not have the same properties or methods as `object_create`, which is a function that creates a new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Object()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Object()` creates a new object and is not the same as `object_create`, which is a function that creates a new object.

DONE.
