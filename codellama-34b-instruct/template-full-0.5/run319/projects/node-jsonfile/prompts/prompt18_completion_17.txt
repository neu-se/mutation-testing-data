  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is a function that reads a file asynchronously, while `fs.readFileSync` is a function that reads a file synchronously. Using `fs.readFile` would cause the code to read the file asynchronously, which could result in different behavior if the file is large or if there are other concurrent operations being performed on the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a function that reads a file synchronously, while `fs.readFile` is a function that reads a file asynchronously. Using `fs.readFileSync` would cause the code to read the file synchronously, which could result in different behavior if the file is large or if there are other concurrent operations being performed on the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
