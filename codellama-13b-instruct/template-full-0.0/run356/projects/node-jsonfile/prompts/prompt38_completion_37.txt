  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `universalify.fromCallback` to convert a callback-based function to a promise-based function, while the new code fragment uses `universalify.fromPromise` to convert a promise-based function to a callback-based function. This would likely cause the test suite to fail, as the test cases are likely written to expect the promise-based function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `universalify.fromCallback` to convert a callback-based function to a promise-based function, while the new code fragment uses `fs.readFile` directly. This would likely cause the test suite to fail, as the test cases are likely written to expect the promise-based function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior
