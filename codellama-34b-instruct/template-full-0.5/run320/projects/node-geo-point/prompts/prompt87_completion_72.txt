  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the angular distance in radians, while the new code calculates the angular distance in degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the angular distance without adding a constant, while the new code adds a constant to the angular distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the angular distance without subtracting a constant, while the new code subtracts a constant from the angular distance.

DONE.
