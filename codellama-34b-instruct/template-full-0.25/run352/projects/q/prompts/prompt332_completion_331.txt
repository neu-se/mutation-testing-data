  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is used to resolve the promise with a value, while the `reject` function is used to reject the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error, while the original code would resolve the promise with the value returned by the `resolve` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is used to create a new promise that is resolved with the specified value, while the original code would resolve the promise with the value returned by the `resolve` function.

DONE.
