  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the imaginary part of the result, while `a` would be used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the imaginary part of the result, while `c` would be used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the imaginary part of the result, while `d` would be used instead.

DONE.
