  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'array'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b` will evaluate to `object` when `b` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b` will evaluate to `object` when `b` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b` will evaluate to `object` when `b` is a function.

DONE.
