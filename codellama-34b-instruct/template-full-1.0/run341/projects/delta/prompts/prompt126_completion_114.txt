  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider one more position than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all positions starting from the start position, instead of stopping before it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all positions starting from the position after the start position.

DONE.
