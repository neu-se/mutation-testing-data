  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a random string instead of a country object, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return `undefined` instead of a country object, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a country object, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to fail.

DONE.
