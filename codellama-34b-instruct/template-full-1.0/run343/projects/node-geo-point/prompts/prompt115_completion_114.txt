  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` would round the latitude value down to the nearest integer, while the original code fragment would calculate the angle of latitude in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.latitude + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would add 180 degrees to the latitude value, resulting in a different coordinate on the sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is used instead of the latitude value, resulting in a different point on the sphere.

DONE.
