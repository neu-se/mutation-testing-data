  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is not being called in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called in the original code fragment, but it is not being passed any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with a different argument in the original code fragment.

DONE.
