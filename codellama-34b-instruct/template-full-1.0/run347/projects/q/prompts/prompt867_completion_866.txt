  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify`, which is a different method from `deferred.resolve`. Using `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value, whereas using `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved without a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify`, which is a different method from `deferred.reject`. Using `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas using `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved without a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify`, which is a different method
