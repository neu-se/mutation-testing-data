  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src === isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `src` to the `isGlob` function itself, rather than checking if `src` is a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original check, returning `true` if `src` is not a glob pattern, rather than `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the result of `isGlob(src)` to `false`, rather than comparing `src` to a glob pattern.

DONE.
