Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly identify the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a built-in JavaScript constructor, and calling `String(destParent).root` would result in `undefined`, as `String` objects do not have a `root` property. This change would cause the function to always return, as the condition `destParent === String(destParent).root` would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd` returns the current working directory, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly identify the root directory, as it would be comparing the current working directory to the destination parent directory.

DONE.
