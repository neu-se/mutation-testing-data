  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is swapped, causing the calculation to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be performed with the sum of `x` and `y`, rather than their product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be performed with the product of `x` and `y`, rather than their sum.

DONE.
