  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result of the `acos` function to be off by 1, which could cause errors in the rest of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result of the `acos` function to be off by 1 in the opposite direction, which could also cause errors in the rest of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result of the `acos` function to be doubled, which could cause errors in the rest of the calculation if the result is used in a subsequent calculation.

DONE.
