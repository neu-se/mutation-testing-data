Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the same operation to be processed multiple times instead of moving forward in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` advances the iterator by one unit, which may not correspond to the actual operation that should be processed, leading to incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(0)` does not advance the iterator at all, effectively skipping the operation that should be processed and potentially leading to an incomplete or incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
