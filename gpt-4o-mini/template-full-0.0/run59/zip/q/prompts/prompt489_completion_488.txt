Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly reset the unhandled rejections tracking state to `true`, potentially causing the system to track rejections that should not be tracked, leading to incorrect handling of promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push("Unexpected error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly manipulate the `unhandledReasons` array, adding a new reason without following the proper flow of tracking unhandled rejections, which could lead to misleading information about the state of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable the tracking of unhandled rejections entirely, meaning that any subsequent unhandled rejections would not be tracked or reported, potentially leading to silent failures in the promise handling logic.

DONE.
