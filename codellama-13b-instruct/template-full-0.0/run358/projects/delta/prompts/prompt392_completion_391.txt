  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object is being used instead of the `length` property. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object is being used instead of the `length` property. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the maximum value between the `insert` properties of the `thisOp` and `otherOp` objects is being used instead of the `length` property. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` properties are not numbers.
