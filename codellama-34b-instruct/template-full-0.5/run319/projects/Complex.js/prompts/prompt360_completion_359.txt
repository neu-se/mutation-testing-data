  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b`, which is a different variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b`, which is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b`, which is a different variable.

DONE.
