  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `b`, which may cause the comparison to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` will be incremented by 1, which may cause the comparison to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` will be doubled, which may cause the comparison to fail.

DONE.
