  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function, and `read && true` will always evaluate to `true`, even if the function throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This would result in different behavior because `!read` will negate the value of `read`, even if it is a function. If `read` is a function that returns a truthy value, it will evaluate to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `read || true` will always evaluate to `true`, even if `read` is a function that throws an error.

DONE.
