  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `retain` branch when the original condition would have executed the `insert` branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `insert` branch when the original condition would have executed the `retain` branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `retain` branch when the original condition would have executed the `insert` branch.

DONE.
