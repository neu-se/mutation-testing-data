  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not always a number, and the `delete` property is not always a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is not always a string, and the `delete` property is not always a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not always an object, and the `delete` property is not always a number.

DONE.
