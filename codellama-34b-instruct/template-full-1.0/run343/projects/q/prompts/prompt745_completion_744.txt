  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because onFulfilled is not the same as onRejected, so it would not handle rejected promises correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because onRejected is not the same as onFulfilled, so it would not handle fulfilled promises correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onDone
```
This would result in different behavior because onDone does not exist, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
