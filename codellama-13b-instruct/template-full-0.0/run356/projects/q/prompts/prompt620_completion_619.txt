  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only sets the property value, while the new code fragment also sets the property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only deletes the property value, while the new code fragment also deletes the property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only posts the method name, while the new code fragment also posts the method arguments.

DONE.
