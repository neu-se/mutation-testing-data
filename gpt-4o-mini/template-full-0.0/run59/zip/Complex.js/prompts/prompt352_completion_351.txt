Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the cosine calculation from using the imaginary part `b` to using the real part `a`, which alters the output of the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine function with the sine function, which fundamentally changes the mathematical operation being performed in the `cosh` calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the variable `b` with a constant `0`, which would lead to a different result in the `cosh` calculation, effectively ignoring the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
