 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would immediately resolve the returned promise with an empty array, instead of waiting for all input promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would always return a promise that resolves to an array with `null` values, instead of the actual resolved values of the input promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (promises) { return promises.slice(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would create a shallow copy of the input array, and any changes to the original array would not affect the resolved array. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the original array is modified after calling `allResolved`.

DONE.
