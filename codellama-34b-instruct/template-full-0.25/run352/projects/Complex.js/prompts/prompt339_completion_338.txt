  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 1 and `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0 and `b` is not equal to 0.
