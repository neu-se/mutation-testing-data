  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the attributes in the `compose` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cloneDeep` function to return a null object, which would then be used in the `reduce` function, potentially causing errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cloneDeep` function to return an undefined object, which would then be used in the `reduce` function, potentially causing errors.

DONE.
