Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's values, which could lead to a situation where the length of the array is checked instead of the number of keys, potentially allowing empty objects to pass through incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes` is expected to be an object, and checking `attributes.length` will always return `undefined`, leading to a false positive in the condition and allowing the operation to proceed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the condition to only allow objects with exactly one key, which could prevent valid objects with multiple keys from being processed correctly.

DONE.
