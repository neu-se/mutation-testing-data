  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `definition` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `define`. This would cause the `definition` function to be executed immediately, rather than being executed when the module is loaded.

DONE.
