  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the error handling in the original code and instead immediately return the mapped data, even if there was an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with the `abort` value, even if there was no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with the error value, even if there was no error.

DONE.
