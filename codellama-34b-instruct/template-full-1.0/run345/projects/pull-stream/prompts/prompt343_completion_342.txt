  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function, and `abort === true` is comparing the function to the boolean `true`, which would always be false. In the original code, `abort` is being called as a function, so the behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a different function than `abort`. In the original code, `abort` is being called with a specific argument, while `onAbort` would be called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `onAbort` with a different set of arguments than the original code. In the original code, `onAbort` is called with two arguments, while this new code would call it with
