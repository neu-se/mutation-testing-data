  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      typeof newOp.delete !== 'number' &&
      typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the conditional, ensuring that the `delete` key is not a number, instead of checking if it is. This could potentially cause the code to misbehave if the `delete` key is not a number, but this is not explicitly stated in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
      typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' &&
      newOp.delete > lastOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `delete` key is a number and greater than the `delete` key in the previous operation. This would potentially cause the code to misbehave if the `delete` key is greater than the previous one, but this is not explicitly stated in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
