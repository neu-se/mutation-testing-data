  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called with a `null` context, whereas the original code fragment had a `this` context. This could potentially cause the `continuer` function to behave differently when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called with a different context than the original code fragment. This could potentially cause the `continuer` function to behave differently when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(function () {}, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called with a different context than the original code fragment. This could potentially cause the `continuer` function to behave differently when it is called.

DONE.
