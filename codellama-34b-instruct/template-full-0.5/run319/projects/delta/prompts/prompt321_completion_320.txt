  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete && typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `retain` block to be executed when `op.delete` is `true`, which was not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the `retain` property, causing the `retain` block to be executed when `op.retain` is a string, which was not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the `retain` property, causing the `retain` block to be executed when `op.retain` is a number, which was not the case
