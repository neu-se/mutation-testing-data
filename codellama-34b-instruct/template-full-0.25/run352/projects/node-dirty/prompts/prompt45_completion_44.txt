  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than the one provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is concatenated with the string `'1'`, which would cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than the one provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is converted to uppercase, which would cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than the one provided.

DONE.
