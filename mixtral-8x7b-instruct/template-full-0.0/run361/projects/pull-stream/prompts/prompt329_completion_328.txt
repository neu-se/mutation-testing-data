 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op ? op : data
```
This would result in different behavior because if `op` is falsy, it will return `data` instead of doing nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will attempt to call `op` as a function, even if it's not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete op
```
This would result in different behavior because it will delete the `op` variable, potentially causing issues in the rest of the code.

DONE.
