  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the angle to be calculated in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 180 degrees to the angle would cause it to be calculated in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator would cause the angle to be wrapped around to a different value, potentially resulting in the same bearing being calculated.

DONE.
