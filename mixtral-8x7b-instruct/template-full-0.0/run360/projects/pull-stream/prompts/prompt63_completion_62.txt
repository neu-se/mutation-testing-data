 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is falsy, it will always set `loop` to false, and the function will stop reading data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always set `end` to `abort`, which might not be the desired behavior and could lead to unexpected function termination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will force the loop to stop, even if there's more data to be read from the stream. This could cause the function to terminate prematurely.

DONE.
