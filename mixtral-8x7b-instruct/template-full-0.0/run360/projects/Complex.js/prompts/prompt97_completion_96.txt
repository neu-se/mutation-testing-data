 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat('invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to parse a string that cannot be converted to a number, causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division by zero error, causing a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(z['re']) || isNaN(z['im']) ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the function to always return a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to 0 or 1, regardless of the input values, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
