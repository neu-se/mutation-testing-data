  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that is bound to the `null` context, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a different `this` value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls the `onUnhandledError` function with the `null` context, which would cause the function to be called with a different `this` value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls the `onUnhandledError` function with the `null` context, which would cause the function to be called with a different `this` value than the original code.
