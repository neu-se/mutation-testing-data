  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["then"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` will access the `then` property of the `promise` object, while `promise["then"]` will access the property named "then" which may or may not exist on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then().then
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` will create a new promise and return it, while `promise.then().then` will create two nested promises and return the inner one, which may or may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["then"]().then
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise["then"]` will access the property named "then" on the `promise` object, which may or may not exist, and then call it as a function, while `promise["then"]().then`
