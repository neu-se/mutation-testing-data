  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part would be inverted, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 1 would be added to the imaginary part, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part would be doubled, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part.

DONE.
