  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function for the `mapper` argument, while this code would only return the `id` function if the `mapper` argument is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `mapper` is truthy, while this code would only return the `id` function if `mapper` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `mapper` function with the `data` argument, while this code would call the `mapper` function with no arguments.

DONE.
