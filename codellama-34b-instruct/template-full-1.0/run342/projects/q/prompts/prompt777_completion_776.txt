  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method of the `Promise.prototype` object in the code, and replacing it with `null` would result in a `TypeError` when attempting to call the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method of the `Promise.prototype` object in the code, and replacing it with `undefined` would result in a `TypeError` when attempting to call the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method of the `Promise.prototype` object in the code, and replacing `inspect` with `then` would result in a different method being called, which could cause the code to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
