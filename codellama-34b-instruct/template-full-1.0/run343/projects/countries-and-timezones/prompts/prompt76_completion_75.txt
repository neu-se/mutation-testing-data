  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the value of `timezone` was not truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezone` is equal to the value `null`. In JavaScript, `null` is a falsy value, so this new code fragment would produce a different result if `timezone` was `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the value of `timezone` was not truthy, while this new code fragment checks if the `name` property of `timezone` is falsy. If `timezone` is not defined, then the property access will throw an error and the program will not terminate successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name && timezone.name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked
