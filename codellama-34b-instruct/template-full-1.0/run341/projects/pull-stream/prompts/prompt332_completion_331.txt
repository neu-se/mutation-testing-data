  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass a boolean value to `once` function, while `null` would pass a null value. This could potentially cause the `once` function to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass a boolean value to `once` function, while `undefined` would pass an undefined value. This could potentially cause the `once` function to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass a boolean value to `once` function, while `false` would pass a boolean value that is the opposite of `end` boolean value. This could potentially cause the `once` function to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
