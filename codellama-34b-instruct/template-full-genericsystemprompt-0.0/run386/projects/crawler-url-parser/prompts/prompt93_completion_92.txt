  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { removeDirectoryIndex: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `removeDirectoryIndex` option would be set to `false`, which would cause the directory index to be included in the parsed URL, even if it is not present in the original URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { removeTrailingSlash: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `removeTrailingSlash` option would be set to `false`, which would cause the trailing slash to be included in the parsed URL, even if it is not present in the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeHttps: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeHttps` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the URL to be normalized to use the `https` protocol
