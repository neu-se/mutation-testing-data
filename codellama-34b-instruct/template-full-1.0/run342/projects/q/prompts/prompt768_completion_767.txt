  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would not receive a valid argument, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would receive a null value, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would receive an object without a `then` method, causing an error.

DONE.
