  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abortCb` is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abortCb` is falsy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abortCb` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `abortCb` is falsy.

DONE.
