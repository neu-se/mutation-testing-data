  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the value of `end` plus 1, instead of the value of `end` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the value of `end` minus 1, instead of the value of `end` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the value 0, instead of the value of `end`.

DONE.
