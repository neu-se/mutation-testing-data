  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key-value pair from the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key-value pair in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all key-value pairs from the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key-value pair in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the size of the map to 0, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key-value pair in the map.

DONE.
