  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would always return `0`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would always return `null`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would always return an empty array, regardless of the input.

DONE.
