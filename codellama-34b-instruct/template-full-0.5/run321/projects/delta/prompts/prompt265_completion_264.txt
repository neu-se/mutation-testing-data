  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is attempting to delete the first element of the `otherOp` array, but the modified code fragment is attempting to delete the first element of the `retDelta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is attempting to retain the first element of the `otherOp` array, but the modified code fragment is attempting to retain the first element of the `retDelta` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).compose(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is attempting to compose the `otherOp` array with itself, but the modified code fragment is attempting to compose the `retDelta` array with the `otherOp` array.

DONE.
