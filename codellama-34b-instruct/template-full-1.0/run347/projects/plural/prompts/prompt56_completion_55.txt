  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to properly handle the case where the input word ends with "y" and is a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'vozes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to properly handle the case where the input word ends with "o" and is a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to properly handle the case where the input word ends with "s" and is a vowel.

DONE.
