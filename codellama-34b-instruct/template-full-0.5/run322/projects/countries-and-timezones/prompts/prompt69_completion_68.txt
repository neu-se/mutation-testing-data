  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `name` property is not defined in the `timezones` object, while this new code fragment checks if it is defined. If `timezones[name]` is defined, the `memoizeTimezone` function will not be called, which could result in a different set of memoized timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `name` property is not defined in the `timezones` object, while this new code fragment checks if it is not defined. If `timezones[name]` is not defined, the `memoizeTimezone` function will not be called, which could result in a different set of memoized timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] !== undefined
