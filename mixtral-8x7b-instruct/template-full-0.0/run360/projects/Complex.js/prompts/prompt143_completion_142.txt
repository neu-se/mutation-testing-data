 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement always evaluates to `true`, bypassing the condition that checks if `z` is infinite and causing the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` even when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is infinite, while the original code checks if `this` is infinite. This could lead to incorrect results when the current instance is not infinite but `z` is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the current instance is zero, while the original code checks if `z` is zero. This could lead to incorrect results when the real part of the current instance is not zero but `z` is.

DONE.
