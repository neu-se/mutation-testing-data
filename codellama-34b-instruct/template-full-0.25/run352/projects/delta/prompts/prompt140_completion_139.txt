  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 0) {
  otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the iterator to advance to a different position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 0) {
  otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the iterator to advance to a different position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 0) {
  otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called
