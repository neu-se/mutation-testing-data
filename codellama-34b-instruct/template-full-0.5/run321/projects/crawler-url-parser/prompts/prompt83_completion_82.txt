  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current element, while the new code fragment uses `find('a')` to select all anchor elements inside the current element. This would cause the `href` attribute of the first anchor element inside the current element to be returned, rather than the `href` attribute of the current element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).is('a') ? this.href : null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` to refer to the current element, while the new code fragment uses `is('a')` to check if the current element is an anchor element. If the current element is an anchor element, the `href` attribute is returned, otherwise `null` is returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') || $(this).find('a').
