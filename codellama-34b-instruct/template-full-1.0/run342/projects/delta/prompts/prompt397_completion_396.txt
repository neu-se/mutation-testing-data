  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the specified number of characters from the delta, rather than inserting the transformed data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, transformedData);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified number of characters from the delta, rather than inserting the transformed data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(transformedData);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the transformed data onto the delta, rather than deleting or retaining the original data.

DONE.
