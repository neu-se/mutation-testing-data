 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `false` as the first argument to the callback, instead of the original `null` or `true` based on the iteration status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current iteration index as the first argument to the callback, instead of the original `null` or `true` based on the iteration status.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current array element as the first argument to the callback, instead of the original `null` or `true` based on the iteration status. It would also cause the function to exhaust the input array earlier than expected, since the elements would be passed as the first argument to the callback.

DONE.
