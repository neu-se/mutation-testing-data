  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` would be called twice in the case of a rejected promise, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` would be called twice in the case of a fulfilled promise, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, and replacing it with a different function would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
