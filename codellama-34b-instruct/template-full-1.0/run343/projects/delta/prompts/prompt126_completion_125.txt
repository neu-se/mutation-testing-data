  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (startIndex < endIndex) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to execute an extra iteration, potentially leading to an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (startIndex <= endIndex) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to execute one fewer iteration, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (startIndex >= endIndex) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to execute zero iterations, potentially leading to a program crash or undefined behavior.

DONE.
