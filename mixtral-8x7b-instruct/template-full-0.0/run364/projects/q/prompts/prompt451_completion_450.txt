 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.push(reason.stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only pushes the stack property of the reason object, discarding the "(no stack) " string and the reason value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.unshift("(no stack) " + reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the reason value with the "(no stack) " prefix at the beginning of the unhandledReasons array instead of appending it to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always pushes null to the unhandledReasons array, regardless of the reason value, which could lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
