  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called with the expected `promise` argument, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called with the expected `promise` argument, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a string argument, rather than a promise object, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
