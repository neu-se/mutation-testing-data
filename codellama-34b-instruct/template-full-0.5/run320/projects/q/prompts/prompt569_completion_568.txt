  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be bound to the `continuer` function with the argument `"throw"`, which would cause the `errback` function to be called with the argument `"throw"` when the `generator` throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be bound to the `continuer` function with the argument `"next"`, which would cause the `errback` function to be called with the argument `"next"` when the `generator` throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.bind(continuer, "throw", "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be bound to the `continuer` function with the arguments
