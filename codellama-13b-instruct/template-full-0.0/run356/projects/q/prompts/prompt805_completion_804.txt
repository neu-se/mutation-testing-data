  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `finally` method to attach a listener to the promise, while the buggy code fragment uses the `finally` property to access the `finally` method. This would cause the listener to be attached to the `finally` method instead of the promise, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `finally` method to attach a listener to the promise, while the buggy code fragment uses the `finally` property to access the `finally` method. This would cause the listener to be attached to the `finally` method instead of the promise, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fin
