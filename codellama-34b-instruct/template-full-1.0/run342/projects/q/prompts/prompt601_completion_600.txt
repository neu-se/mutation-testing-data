  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])` would return `null` instead of a promise, causing errors in any code that relies on the return value of `Q.get`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])` would return `undefined` instead of a promise, causing errors in any code that relies on the return value of `Q.get`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])` would return `this.resolve` instead of a promise, causing errors in any code that relies on the return value of `Q.get`.

DONE.
