  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/g, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regex to match multiple instances of the pattern instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://'
```
Within the code, the expression is not part of a `"..."` or `'...'` string literal, so the `'http://'` will be treated as a constant string, causing the expression to evaluate to a string result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, parse(baseUrl).protocol
```
Within the code, the expression is used as part of a string template, so the `parse(baseUrl).protocol` is evaluated to its value and result the expression into a URL protocol.

DONE.
