  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb2
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra variable `verb2` is declared, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior if it is used elsewhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (verbs[verb] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition checks if the `verb` property is defined in the `verbs` object, rather than simply checking if it is truthy. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `verb` property is defined but is a "falsy" value (such as an empty string or the number 0).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verbs = ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verbs` object is redefined to be an array with the strings 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', and 'DELETE' as its members, rather than being an object
