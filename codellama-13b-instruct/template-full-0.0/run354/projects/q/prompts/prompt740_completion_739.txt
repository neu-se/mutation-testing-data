  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, while `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object and immediately resolves it with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that takes a promise or value and returns a promise for the value, while `Q.when()` is a function that returns a promise for the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that takes an array of promises or values and returns a promise for an array of the values, while `Q.all()` is a function that returns a promise for an empty array.

DONE.
