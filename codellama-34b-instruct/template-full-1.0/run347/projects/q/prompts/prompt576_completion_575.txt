  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){})()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the function expression immediately, instead of passing it as a reference to be invoked by the `continuer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){})().bind(continuer)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `continuer` function to the `this` context of the invoked function expression, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(continuer)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `continuer` function, passing no arguments, instead of passing it as a reference to be invoked by the `makeGenerator` function.

DONE.
