  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property of the `Complex` object is the imaginary part of the number, whereas the `re` property is the real part. Using `z['im']` instead of `z['re']` would cause the `pow` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pow` function would be multiplying the real part of the number by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pow` function would be adding the real and imaginary parts of the number instead of multiplying them, which would cause the result to be different.

DONE.
