  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain consecutive slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== null && spec.match(/\/\//).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while the new code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes and the number of consecutive slashes is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== null && spec.match(/\/\//).length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while the new code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes and the number of consecutive slashes is equal to
