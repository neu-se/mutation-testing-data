  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different subset of arguments, potentially causing the function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different subset of arguments, potentially causing the function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return all the arguments, potentially causing the function to produce a different output.

DONE.
