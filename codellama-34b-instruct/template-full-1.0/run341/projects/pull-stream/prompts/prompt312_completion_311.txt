  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the && operator, which only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is truthy. In contrast, the code fragment provided uses the ? : operator, which always evaluates both operands. As a result, the `terminate(cb)` function will be called even if the `last` variable is falsy, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the && operator to evaluate both operands and produce a result based on their values. In contrast, the code fragment provided simply ignores the `data` argument and passes null to the `cb` function, which may not accurately represent the desired behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(null
