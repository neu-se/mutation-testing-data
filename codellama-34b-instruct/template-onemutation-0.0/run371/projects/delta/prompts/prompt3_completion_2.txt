  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy. In the context of the `compose` function, this means that the `Object.assign` version would not recursively copy the properties of the `b` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `b` object contains nested objects or arrays.

DONE.
