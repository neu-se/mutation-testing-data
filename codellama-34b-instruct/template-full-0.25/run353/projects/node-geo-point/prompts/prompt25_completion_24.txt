  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `latitude` property instead of the `longitude` property, which could lead to incorrect calculations and errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `longitude` property plus one, which could lead to incorrect calculations and errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `longitude` property multiplied by two, which could lead to incorrect calculations and errors.

DONE.
