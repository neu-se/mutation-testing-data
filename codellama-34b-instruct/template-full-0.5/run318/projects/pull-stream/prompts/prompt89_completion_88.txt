  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `test` function would be called with the value `false` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the `test` function would be called with the value `true` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, so the function would be called with the opposite value than the original value.

DONE.
