  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's current state, but `promise.inspect.value` would return the value of the promise, which may not be the same as the current state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect.state` would return the state of the promise, which may not be the same as the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect.isFulfilled` would return a boolean indicating whether the promise is fulfilled, which may not be the same as the value of the promise.

DONE.
