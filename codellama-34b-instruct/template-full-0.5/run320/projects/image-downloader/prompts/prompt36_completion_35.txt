  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to instead of overwritten. This could cause the file to grow indefinitely if the same data is being written to it repeatedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten instead of appended to. This could cause data loss if the file is being written to repeatedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'wx' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'wx'`, which means that the file will be created if it does not exist, and the file will be overwritten
