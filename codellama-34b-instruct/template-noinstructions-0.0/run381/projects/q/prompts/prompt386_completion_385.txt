  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a method that applies the callback to the arguments as an array, whereas `fcall` applies the callback to the arguments as a list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `fbind` is a method that binds the callback to the arguments, whereas `fcall` applies the callback to the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` with a null context would call the callback with the global object as the context, whereas `fcall` without a null context would call the callback with the promise as the context.

DONE.
