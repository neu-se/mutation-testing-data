  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b * b` is a multiplication operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `a + b` is an addition operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `Math.cos(b)` is a function call that computes the cosine of `b`.

DONE.
