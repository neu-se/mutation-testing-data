  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the accumulator and the segment, while the modified code fragment concatenates the segment and the accumulator, and then adds a dollar sign to the end of the result.

DONE.
