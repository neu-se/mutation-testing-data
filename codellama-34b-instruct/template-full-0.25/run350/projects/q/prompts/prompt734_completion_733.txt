  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `promises` array starting from the second element, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `promises` array with an empty array, effectively creating a copy of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function(promise) { return promise.then(function(value) { return value; }); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map the `promises` array to a new array of promises, where each promise is resolved with the value of the original promise.

DONE.
