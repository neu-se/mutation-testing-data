  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. By replacing it with `arguments[0]`, we are only considering the first argument passed to the function, which may not be the same as the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. By replacing it with `arguments.length`, we are only considering the length of the `arguments` object, which may not be the same as the actual arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a
