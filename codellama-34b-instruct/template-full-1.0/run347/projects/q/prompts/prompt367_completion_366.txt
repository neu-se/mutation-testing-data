  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw exception` will cause the promise to be rejected with the given exception, whereas `_rejected(exception)` will call the `rejected` callback with the exception as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because `return reject(exception)` will cause the promise to be rejected with the given exception, whereas `_rejected(exception)` will call the `rejected` callback with the exception as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new TypeError('Promise was rejected with a non-exception value');
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` exception, whereas `_rejected(exception)` will call the `rejected` callback with the exception as an argument.

DONE.
