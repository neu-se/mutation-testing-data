  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression to strip the BOM character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(0, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only removes the first three characters of the string, which may not be the BOM character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(0, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only removes the first three characters of the string, which may not be the BOM character.

DONE.
