  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with the `true` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed in a more forgiving way. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with the `null` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed at all. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with the `undefined` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed in a more forgiving way. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result or throw an error.

DONE.
