  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the function to return `null` when `end` is `true`, and the original value of `end` when it is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` when `end` is `true`, and the value of `acc` when it is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : sink
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` when `end` is `true`, and the value of `sink` when it is `false`.

DONE.
