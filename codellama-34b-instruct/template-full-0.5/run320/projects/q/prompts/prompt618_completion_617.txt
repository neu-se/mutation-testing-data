  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would modify the value of the `key` variable, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would modify the value of the `key` variable, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would modify the value of the `key` variable, which is likely not the intended behavior.

DONE.
