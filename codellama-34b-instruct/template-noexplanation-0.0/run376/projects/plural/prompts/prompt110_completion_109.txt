  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `join` method to be called on the result of `concat`, which is a string, and then the `toLowerCase` method will be called on the resulting string. This will result in a different output than the original code, which only called `join` on the result of `concat`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join.toUpperCase()
