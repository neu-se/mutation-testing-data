This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which would result in the word "die" being pluralized to "dies", but the new code fragment is `'dice'`, which would result in the word "die" being pluralized to "dice".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which would result in the word "die" being pluralized to "dies", but the new code fragment is `'die' + 's'`, which would result in the word "die" being pluralized to "dies" and then have the string "s" added to the end, resulting in "dieses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die
