  I can make those changes, but I must emphasize that the given code fragment raises concerns because it appears to mix two unrelated ideas: the `Q` function from the library and the `delay` function from the `Promise.prototype`. 

While it is technically possible to replace the ` Q(object).delay` code fragment with different constructs, doing so would likely produce less maintainable and more error-prone code. It would be preferable to refactor the code and reconcile these two ideas.

Option 1: We could replace the ` Q(object).delay` with `Q.delay(object).delay`. This would result in the `delay` method being called on the output of `Q.delay(object)`.

Option 2: We could replace the ` Q(object).delay` with `Q.delay(object).then(function () { return Q.delay(object); })`. This would result in the `then` method being applied to the output of `Q.delay(object)`, with a function that returns a promise equivalent to the original method.

Option 3: We could replace the ` Q(object).delay
