Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the line is empty instead of non-empty, which would cause the predicate to be called incorrectly when there is content in the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number of operations in the line is greater than one, potentially skipping the predicate call even when there is a single operation present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an impossible condition (length cannot be negative), which would always evaluate to false, preventing the predicate from being called regardless of the line's content.

DONE.
