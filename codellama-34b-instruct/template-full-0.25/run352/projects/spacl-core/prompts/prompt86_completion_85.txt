  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with a different argument, which would create a shallow copy of the `rule` object instead of a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with a different argument, which would create a deep copy of the `rule` object instead of a shallow copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, !deep)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with a different argument, which would create a deep copy of the `rule` object if `deep` is `false`, and a shallow copy if `deep` is `true`.

DONE.
