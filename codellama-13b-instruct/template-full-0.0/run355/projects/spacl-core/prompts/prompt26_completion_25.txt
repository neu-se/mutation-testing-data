  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be negative, which would cause the `flatten` function to produce an invalid regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be greater than 1, which would cause the `flatten` function to produce an invalid regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable would be negative, which would cause the `flatten` function to produce an invalid regular expression.

DONE.
