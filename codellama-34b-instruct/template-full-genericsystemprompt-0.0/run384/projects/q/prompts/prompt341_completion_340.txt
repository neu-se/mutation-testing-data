  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being used as a constructor here. Instead, it is being called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(value, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being used as a constructor here. Instead, it is being called with `value` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(value, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being used as a constructor here. Instead, it is being called with `value` as both arguments
