  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the `end !== true` condition would be evaluated first. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!==` operator, so the `end !== false` condition would be evaluated first. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the `end !== null` condition would be evaluated first. This would cause the `if
