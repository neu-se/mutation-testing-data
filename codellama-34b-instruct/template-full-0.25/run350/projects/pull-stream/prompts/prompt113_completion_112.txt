  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, `!cb` will be falsy, and vice versa. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is truthy. If `cb` is falsy, the `&&` operator will short-circuit and return `cb`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch. Additionally, if `acc` is falsy, the `&&` operator will return `acc`, which could also cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || acc
```
This would result in different
