  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased from 0 to 1, causing the `flush` function to be called after an additional millisecond.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased from 0 to -1, causing the `flush` function to be called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be changed from 0 to 0.5, causing the `flush` function to be called after half a millisecond.

DONE.
