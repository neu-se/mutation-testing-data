  Sure, I can do that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method would not be called, which would prevent the attributes from being inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method would be called with an empty array, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method would be called with an empty object, which would cause an error.

DONE.
