  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would return the first character of the string, while `1` would return the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would return the first character of the string, while `-1` would return the last character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would return the first character of the string, while `"hello"` would return the string `"hello"`.

DONE.
