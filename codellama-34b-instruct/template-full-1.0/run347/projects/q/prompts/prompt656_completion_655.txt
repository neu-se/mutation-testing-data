  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER in the original code fragment can be replaced with:
```realConstant`
```
This would result in different behavior because `realConstant` has a different value than `array_slice`, which would cause the code to produce a different array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER in the original code fragment can be replaced with:
```Promise.race`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` is a function that takes an array of promises and returns a promise that resolves with the value of the first promise in the array that is resolved, whereas `array_slice` is a function that takes an array and returns a new array containing a slice of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER in the original code fragment can be replaced with:
```array_map`
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a function that takes an array and a callback function, and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element of the original array, whereas `array_slice` is a
