  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a reference to the current object, rather than the array of reported unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a reference to the null value, rather than the array of reported unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be an empty array, rather than the array of reported unhandled rejections.

DONE.
