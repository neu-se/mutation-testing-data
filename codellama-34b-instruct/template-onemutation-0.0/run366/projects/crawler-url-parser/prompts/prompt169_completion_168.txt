  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the path, while the new code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the first part of the path.
