  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` refers to the entire data object, while `data[0]` refers to the first element of the data object. If the data object is empty or has only one element, the behavior of the program would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` refers to the entire data object, while `data.length` refers to the length of the data object. If the data object is empty or has a different number of elements, the behavior of the program would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` refers to the entire data object, while `data.slice(0, 1)` refers to the first element of the data object. If the data object is empty or
