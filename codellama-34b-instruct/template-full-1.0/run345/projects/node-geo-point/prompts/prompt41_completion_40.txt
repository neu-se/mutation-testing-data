  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could change the resulting distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the arc cosine of the ratio of the hypotenuse to the adjacent side, which would produce a different result than the original calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(b, c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the arc tangent of the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, which would produce a different result than the original calculation.

DONE.
