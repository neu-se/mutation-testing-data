Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `slice` method directly on the `Array.prototype` object, which would not work as intended since `call` is not a method of `Array.prototype.slice`, leading to a TypeError when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array and returns the removed elements, whereas `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array without modifying it, which could lead to unexpected side effects in the code that relies on the original array remaining unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by combining the original array with additional elements, rather than returning a shallow copy of a portion of the array, which would change the expected output of any operations that depend on the behavior of `slice`.

DONE.
