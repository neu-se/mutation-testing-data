  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will reject the promise with the given reason, whereas `thenResolve` will resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` will create a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, whereas `thenResolve` will resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { throw value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` will create a new promise that is rejected with the thrown value, whereas `thenResolve` will resolve the promise with the given value.

DONE.
