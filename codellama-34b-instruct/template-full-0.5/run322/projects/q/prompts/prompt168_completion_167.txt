  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not filter out internal or node frames, resulting in a longer stack trace that includes more irrelevant information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) || !isNodeFrame(line) || line
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not filter out internal or node frames, resulting in a longer stack trace that includes more irrelevant information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not filter out node frames, resulting in a longer stack trace that includes more irrelevant information.

DONE.
