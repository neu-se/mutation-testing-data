  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical not operator `!` would negate the result of the test for infinity, while the original code fragment would have resulted in a positive or 0 value for infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zero
```
This would result in different behavior because `zero` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet, while the original code fragment references the `Zero` property of the `Complex` class, which is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that represents "not a number", while the original code fragment uses the `isInfinite` method to test for infinity.

DONE.
