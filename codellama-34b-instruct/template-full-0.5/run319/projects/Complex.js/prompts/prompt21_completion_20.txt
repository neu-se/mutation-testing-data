  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the square root, potentially causing the function to return a complex number with a negative real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a complex number with a non-integer real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b / (a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a complex number with a non-integer imaginary part.

DONE.
