 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, leaving the rejection untracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, leaving the rejection untracked. In JavaScript, a non-empty array is truthy, but a number (including 0) is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
""
