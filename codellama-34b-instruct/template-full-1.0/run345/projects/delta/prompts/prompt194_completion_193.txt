  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks that both conditions are true, while the original code fragment only checked that `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` is true. This means that if `otherIter.peekLength()` is 0, the code would still execute the body of the if statement, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' || otherIter.peekLength() > 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks that either condition is true, while the original code fragment only checked that `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` is true. This means that if `otherIter.peekLength()` is 0, the code would still execute the body of the if statement, which might not be the
