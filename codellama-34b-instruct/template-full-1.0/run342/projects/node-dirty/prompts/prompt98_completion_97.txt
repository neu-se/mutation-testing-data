  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'errors'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with the name 'errors' instead of 'error'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'success'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a success event instead of an error event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a warning event instead of an error event.

DONE.
