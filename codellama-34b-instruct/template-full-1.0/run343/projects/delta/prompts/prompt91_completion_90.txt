  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, even if `newOp.attributes` is an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to the opposite of the intended behavior, i.e. it would return `true` if `newOp.attributes` is not an object, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only work if `newOp.attributes` is an array, and it would return `true` if the array is empty, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
