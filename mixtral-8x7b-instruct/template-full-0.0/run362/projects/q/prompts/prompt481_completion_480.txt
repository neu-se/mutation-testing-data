 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array slice would receive an integer as the second argument instead of a number indicating the position to stop copying elements from the `unhandledReasons` array. This would cause the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return an array with incorrect length and content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array would be returned directly instead of creating a copy of it using `slice()`. This would allow consumers to modify the internal state of the unhandled rejections tracking mechanism.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array slice would receive a fixed value (0) as the second argument instead of a number indicating the position to stop copy
