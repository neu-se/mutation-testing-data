  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would start counting from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would start counting from 2 instead of 1, which could cause the function to skip over the first element in the array and return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not have a starting point for the count and would return incorrect results.

DONE.
