  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the type of the rule[0] variable, which would cause the function to always return the word + 's' plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word && type(rule[0]) === 'String'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the rule[0] variable is a string and is equal to the word variable, which would cause the function to only return the word + 's' plural form if the rule[0] variable is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word && type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the rule[0] variable is a non-empty string and is equal to the word variable
