  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next element in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` is also a function, but it returns the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that can be used to represent the absence of an object or a null pointer, it would cause the code to fail at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(thisIter.next++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator before returning the element, this change would cause the iterator to skip every other element.

DONE.
