  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a different method than `call`, and it would change the way the function is called, potentially resulting in different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to the object, whereas `call` simply calls the function with the object as the context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.memoize
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoize` is not a built-in method of `Object.prototype.toString`, and it would likely cause an error if it were used in place of `call`.

DONE.
