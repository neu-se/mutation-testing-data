  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is multiplying the real part of the complex number by 2, while the new code fragment is multiplying the real part by 2 and subtracting the real part from the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is multiplying the real part of the complex number by 2, while the new code fragment is multiplying the real part by 2 and adding the imaginary part to the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is multiplying the real part of the complex number by 2, while the new code fragment is multiplying the real part by 2 and adding the real part and imaginary part to the original value.
