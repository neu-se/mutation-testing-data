  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)` would always be positive, while `cos(φ2)` can be positive or negative depending on the latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1)` would always be positive, while `sin(φ2)` can be positive or negative depending on the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan(φ1)` would always be positive, while `tan(φ2)` can be positive or negative depending on the latitude.

DONE.
