  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being negated, which would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
