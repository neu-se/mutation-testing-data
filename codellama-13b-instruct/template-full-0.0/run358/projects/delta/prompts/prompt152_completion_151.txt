  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()) || otherIter.hasNext()`, which would always return `true` if `otherIter.hasNext()` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be evaluated as `(thisIter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext()) || otherIter.hasNext()`, which would always return `true` if `otherIter.hasNext()` is `true`.
