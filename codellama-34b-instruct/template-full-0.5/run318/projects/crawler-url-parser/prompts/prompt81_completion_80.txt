  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hrefs'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to access the non-existent property `hrefs` instead of `href`, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to access the property `hrefs` instead of `href`, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to access the property `href ` instead of `href`, which would cause an error.

DONE.
