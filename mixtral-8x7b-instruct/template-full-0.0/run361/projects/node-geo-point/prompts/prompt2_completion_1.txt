 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
latitude === -90 || latitude === 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for strict equality, which would allow latitude values of -90 and 90, potentially causing issues in certain applications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(latitude) > 90
