  Option 1: ThePLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity, while `Math.round` rounds towards zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Math.ceil` rounds towards positive infinity, while `Math.round` rounds towards zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function`Math.sin` returns the sine of its argument, while`Math.round` rounds its argument to the nearest integer.

DONE.
