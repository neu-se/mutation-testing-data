  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec` is a function that executes the regular expression and returns an array of matches, whereas `test` is a function that tests if a regular expression matches a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a function that splits a string into an array of substrings, whereas `test` is a function that tests if a regular expression matches a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a function that searches for a match between a regular expression and a string, whereas `test` is a function that tests if a regular expression matches a string.

DONE.
