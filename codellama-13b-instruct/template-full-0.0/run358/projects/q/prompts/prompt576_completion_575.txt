  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(this, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword would be bound to the `continuer` function instead of the `continuer` function's `this` keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(this, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword would be bound to the `continuer` function instead of the `continuer` function's `this` keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(this, "return")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword would be bound to the `continuer` function instead of the `continuer` function's `this` keyword.

DONE.
