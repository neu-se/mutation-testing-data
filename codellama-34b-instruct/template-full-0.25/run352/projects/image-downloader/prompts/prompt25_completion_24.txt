  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname, options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest.split('/').pop()` would return the last part of the path, whereas `__dirname, options.dest` would return the full path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(options.dest)` would return the parent directory of the file, whereas `__dirname, options.dest` would return the full path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename(options.dest)` would return the file name without the path, whereas `__dirname, options.dest` would return the full path.

DONE.
