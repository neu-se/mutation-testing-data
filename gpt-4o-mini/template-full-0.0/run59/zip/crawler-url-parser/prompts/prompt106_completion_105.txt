Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the current URL to the map, it removes it, which would lead to the loss of the URL information and potentially cause issues when trying to access it later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value associated with the current URL to `null`, which means that the URL is stored but without any associated data, leading to incomplete or incorrect information when retrieving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, { text: currentUrl.text, baseurl: baseUrlStr });
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the structure of the stored value by omitting the `currentUrl` object entirely and instead creating a new object with only `text` and `baseurl`, which may not include all necessary properties for further processing.

DONE.
