  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the next index, rather than from the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the previous index, rather than from the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from two indices before the current index, rather than from the current index.

DONE.
