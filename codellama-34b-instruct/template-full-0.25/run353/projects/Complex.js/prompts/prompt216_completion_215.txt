  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, while `Math.exp` returns the exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, while `Math.exp` returns the exponential function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.exp` returns the exponential function.

DONE.
