  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fulfill` method to be called instead of the `reject` method, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(v){throw v;})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` method to be called with a different reason, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fulfill` method to be called instead of the `reject` method, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
