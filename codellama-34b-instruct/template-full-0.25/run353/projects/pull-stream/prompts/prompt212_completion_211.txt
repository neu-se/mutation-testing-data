  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a call to that function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a call to that function with a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a call to that function with a specific context and arguments.

DONE.
