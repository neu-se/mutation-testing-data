  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to be called on `thisOp`, which is not a valid method for the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to be called on `otherOp`, which is not a valid method for the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to be called on `delta`, which is not a valid method for the `Delta` class.

DONE.
