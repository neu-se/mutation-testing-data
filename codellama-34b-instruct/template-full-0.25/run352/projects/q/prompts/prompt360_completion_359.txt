  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `done` variable, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if the `done` variable is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if the `done` variable is strictly not equal to `true`.

DONE.
