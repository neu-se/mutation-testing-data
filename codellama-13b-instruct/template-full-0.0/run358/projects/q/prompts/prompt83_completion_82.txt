  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `flushing`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `requestTick()` function to never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing && !flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `flushing` is `true`, and `true` if `flushing` is `false`. This would cause the `requestTick()` function to be called only when `flushing` is `false`, which could result in different behavior depending on the context in which the code is executed.

DONE.
