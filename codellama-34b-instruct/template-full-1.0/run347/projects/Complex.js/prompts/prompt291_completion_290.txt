  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(a)` returns the sine of the angle `a`, whereas `Math.cos(a)` returns the cosine of the angle `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(1-a*a-b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos(1-a*a-b*b)` returns the arccosine of the angle `1-a*a-b*b`, whereas `Math.cos(a)` returns the cosine of the angle `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b,a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(b,a)` returns the angle in the plane (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the ray from the origin to the point (a,b), whereas
