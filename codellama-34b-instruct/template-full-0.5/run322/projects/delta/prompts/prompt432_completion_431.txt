  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `delete` property of the `nextOp` object, regardless of whether it is a number or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `retain` property of the `nextOp` object, regardless of whether it is a number or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object, regardless of whether it is a string or not.

DONE.
