  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
    Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is not used in the original code, which could cause the test to pass even if the result is not what is expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z['re'] - this['re'] <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
    z['im'] - this['im'] <= Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is not used in the original code, which could cause the test to pass even if the result is not what is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.max(z['re'] - this['re'], z['im'] - this['im'])
