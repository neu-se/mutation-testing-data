  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is squaring both `a` and `b`, while this replacement only multiplies them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding the squares of `a` and `b`, while this replacement only adds `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the squares of `a` and `b`, while this replacement only subtracts `a` and `b`.

DONE.
