  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is called twice, once by the original code and once by the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is called with a different `this` context, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is called with a different set of arguments, which could affect its behavior.

DONE.
