 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally prepends 'http://' to the baseUrlStr, even if it already has a protocol specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace(/\/\//, 'http://');
