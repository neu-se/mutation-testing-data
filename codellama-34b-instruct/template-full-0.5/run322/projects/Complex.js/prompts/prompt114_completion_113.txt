  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the arguments `a` and `b`, which could potentially return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` together, which could potentially return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` and `b` together, which could potentially return a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
