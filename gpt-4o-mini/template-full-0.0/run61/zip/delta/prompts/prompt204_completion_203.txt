Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the remaining operations from `thisIter` instead of the original `rest`, potentially altering the composition of the resulting `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(thisIter.rest().slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation of the remaining operations from `thisIter`, which could lead to loss of data in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(thisIter.rest()).concat(new Delta(otherIter.rest()))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the remaining operations from both `thisIter` and `otherIter`, changing the intended composition logic and potentially resulting in an incorrect `Delta`.

DONE.
