  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with `cb` as its first argument, whereas the original code called it with `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to ` abortCb`, whereas the original code passed `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be passed as the first argument to `abortCb`, whereas the original code passed `true`.

DONE.
