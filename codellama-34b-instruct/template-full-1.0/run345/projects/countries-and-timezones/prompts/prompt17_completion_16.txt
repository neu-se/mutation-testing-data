  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is being set to `null` instead of a truthy value, which would cause the `tz.r === undefined` condition to be `false`, even if `tz` has no `r` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `id` is being set to `null` instead of a valid country ID, which would cause the `result[country]` check to fail and the `countries.forEach` loop to exit prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because `result[country].current` is being set to an empty array instead of a populated one, which would cause the `result[country].current.push(<PLACEHOLDER>)` line to have no effect.

DONE.
