 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string '1' is a truthy value, causing the `op(data)` condition to always evaluate to true, even if the `op` function returns a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `read` function as an argument to the inner `read` call, causing unexpected behavior and most likely throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the inner `read` call, which expects a function as its second argument. This would cause an error and break the expected functionality.

DONE.
