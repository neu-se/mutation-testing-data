  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pendingCount <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used strict equality (`===`) to check if `pendingCount` was equal to 0, whereas this new code uses less than or equal to (`<=`) which would allow `pendingCount` to be greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used strict equality (`===`) to check if `pendingCount` was equal to 0, whereas this new code uses greater than (`>`) which would allow `pendingCount` to be greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!pendingCount
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used strict equality (`===`) to check if `pendingCount` was equal to 0, whereas this new code uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) to negate the value of `p
