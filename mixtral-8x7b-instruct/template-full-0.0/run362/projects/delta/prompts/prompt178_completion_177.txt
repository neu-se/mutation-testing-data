 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable in the `diff` method to be overestimated, potentially causing the method to skip over some operations in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable in the `diff` method to be underestimated, potentially causing the method to process some operations in the `other` delta more than once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable in the `diff` method to be set to 0 when `thisIter.peekLength()` returns `null` or `undefined`, potentially causing the method to skip over some
