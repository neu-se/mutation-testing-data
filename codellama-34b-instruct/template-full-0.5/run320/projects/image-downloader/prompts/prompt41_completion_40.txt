  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Timeout error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `reject` function and result in the promise being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `res.pipe` method would be called twice, which would cause the stream to be piped to the destination file twice, resulting in duplicate data.

DONE.
