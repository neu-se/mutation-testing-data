Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to resolve with `undefined` instead of the actual rejection reason, potentially leading to confusion about the nature of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with the string "Error" regardless of the actual reason for rejection, masking the original error and making debugging more difficult.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejection to be handled with a `null` value instead of the actual reason, which could lead to incorrect handling of the rejection in subsequent promise chains.

DONE.
