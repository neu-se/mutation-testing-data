Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptions[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists and is not undefined, but does not distinguish between properties that exist with a value of undefined and those that do not exist, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in descriptions
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists in the object or its prototype chain, which could lead to false positives if the property exists in a prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptions.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not use the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` method, which is more robust and safe, especially when working with objects that may have overridden the `hasOwnProperty` method.

DONE.
