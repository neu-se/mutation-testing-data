  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` checks if a stack frame is part of the current file, while `isExternalFrame` would check if a stack frame is from an external file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame || isBabelFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack frame is from a Node.js file, while `isBabelFrame` would check if a stack frame is from a Babel file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isReactFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` checks if a stack frame is part of the current file, while `isReactFrame` would check if a stack frame is from a React file.

DONE.
