  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the value of the property at the next index, rather than the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["key" + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the value of the property named "key1", rather than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the value of the property at the previous index, rather than the current one.

DONE.
