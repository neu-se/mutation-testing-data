  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(base).filter(key => base[key] !== attr[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the keys that have a different value in the `base` and `attr` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(base).map(key => base[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of values from the `base` object, rather than an object with the same keys and values as the `base` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(base).reduce((memo, key) => {
  if (base[key] !== attr[key]) {
    memo[key] = base[key];
  }
  return memo;
}, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the keys and values from the `base` object that have a different value in the
