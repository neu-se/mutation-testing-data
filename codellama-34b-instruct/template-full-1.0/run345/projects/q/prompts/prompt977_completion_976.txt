  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER not implemented.")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the `npost` method is called, whereas the original code would have created a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value 42 when the `npost` method is called, whereas the original code would have returned a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined when the `npost` method is called, whereas the original code would have returned a promise.

DONE.
