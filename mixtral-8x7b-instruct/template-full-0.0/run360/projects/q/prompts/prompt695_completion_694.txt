 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function bound to `null` instead of the provided `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function bound to the current context (`this`) instead of the provided `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` method would return a function that creates a promise instead of using the provided `object`.

DONE.
