  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this._inFlightWrites` is less than or equal to 0, while this new code checks if it is strictly less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this._waitForDrain` is true, while this new code checks if it is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this._queue` is empty, while this new code checks if it is not empty.

DONE.
