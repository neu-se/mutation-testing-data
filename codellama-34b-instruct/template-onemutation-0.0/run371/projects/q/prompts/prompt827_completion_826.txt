  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {
    throw new Error("Q.onerror is not a function");
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an unhandled error occurs, but the new code fragment throws an error instead of calling a function.
