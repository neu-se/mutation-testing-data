  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (isGlob(src)) {
    src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
        zipArchive.glob(globPart);
    });
} else {
    zipArchive.directory(src, false);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if `src` was not a glob, but this code is checking if `src` is a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (isGlob(src)) {
    src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
        zipArchive.glob(globPart);
    });
} else {
    zipArchive.directory(src, true);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was passing `false` as the second argument to `zipArchive.directory()`, but this code is passing `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (isGlob(
