  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would not be called, and the reason for the rejection would not be tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would not be called, and the reason for the rejection would not be tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some other reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with a different reason, which could lead to different handling of the rejection.

DONE.
