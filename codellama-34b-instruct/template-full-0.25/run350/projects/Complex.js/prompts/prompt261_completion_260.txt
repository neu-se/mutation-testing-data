  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the original code, and its value would be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not modified in the original code, and its value would be different from the modified value in the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt()` function is not used in the original code, and its result would be different from the modified value in the mutated code.

DONE.
