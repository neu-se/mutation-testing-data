  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code incremented the offset by the length of the current operation, while this modified code decrements it by one. This would cause the offset to be incorrect in the next iteration of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code incremented the offset by the length of the current operation, while this modified code increments it by two. This would cause the offset to be incorrect in the next iteration of the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code incremented the offset by the length of the current operation, while this modified code increments it by twice the length. This would cause the offset to be incorrect in the next iteration of the loop.

DONE.
