  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(0)` would return the first element of the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next()` would return the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(1)` would return the second element of the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next()` would return the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(2)` would return the third element of the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next()` would return the next element.

DONE.
