  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension, while the new code fragment removes the entire path after the last slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension, while the new code fragment replaces it with the string "/default".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default\.[a-z]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the index file extension, while the new code fragment replaces it with a new extension that starts with "/default.".

DONE.
