  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var fileNameAndLineNumber = getFileName(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only get the file name, and not the line number, from the stack line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var fileNameAndLineNumber = getLineNumber(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only get the line number, and not the file name, from the stack line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var fileNameAndLineNumber = getFileAndLineNumber(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get both the file name and line number from the stack line, but it would call a different function to do so.
