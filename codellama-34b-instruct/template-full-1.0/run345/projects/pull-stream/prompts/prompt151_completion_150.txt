  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed as an argument, but instead, `1` is a number, which would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not call the `abortCb` function, it just references it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a value to be returned, but instead, `null` is returned, which would cause the function to return `undefined`.

DONE.
