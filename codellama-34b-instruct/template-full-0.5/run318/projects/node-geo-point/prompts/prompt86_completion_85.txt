  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of `φ2` and the resulting `latitude` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of `φ2` and the resulting `latitude` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of `φ2` and the resulting `latitude` value.

DONE.
