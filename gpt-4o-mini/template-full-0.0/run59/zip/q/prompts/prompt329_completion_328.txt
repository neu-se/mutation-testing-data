Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the caught exception, it would resolve the promise with a `null` value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise chains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = "Error occurred";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a string message instead of rejecting it, which could cause downstream handlers to treat the string as a successful value rather than an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = Promise.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise instead of resolving the current promise with the exception, which could lead to confusion about the state of the original promise and its error handling.

DONE.
