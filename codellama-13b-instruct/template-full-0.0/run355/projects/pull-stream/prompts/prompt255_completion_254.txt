  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip the `nextStream` function and instead return the `read` function directly. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `read` function returns an error or when the `read` function is called multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to call the `nextStream` function directly instead of calling the `read` function. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `nextStream` function returns an error or when the `nextStream` function is called multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = function(abort, cb) {
  cb(null, [1, 2, 3])
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to
