  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the same strings as the original code fragment, but the replacement string would be empty, resulting in the original string being returned unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the same strings as the original code fragment, but the replacement string would be 'foo', resulting in the original string being replaced with 'foo'.

DONE.
