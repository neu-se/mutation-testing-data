  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method is called on the `port1` object instead of the `port2` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method is called on the `port2` object instead of the `port1` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method is called with a `null` argument instead of no argument.

DONE.
