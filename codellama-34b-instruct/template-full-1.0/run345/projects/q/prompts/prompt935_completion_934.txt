  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    array_slice(arguments, 2) < 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would not be called with the correct arguments, causing the `nfapply` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    array_slice(arguments, 2) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different index, causing the `nfapply` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    array_slice(arguments, 2) / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different index, causing the `nfapply` method to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
