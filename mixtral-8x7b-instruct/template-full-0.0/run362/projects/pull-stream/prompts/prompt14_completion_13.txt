 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one more time than the original code, potentially causing unintended side effects or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 < length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run for the last value of `i`, causing some elements of the `args` array to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (i < length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `while` loop would not break after the last iteration, potentially causing unintended side effects or errors.

DONE.
