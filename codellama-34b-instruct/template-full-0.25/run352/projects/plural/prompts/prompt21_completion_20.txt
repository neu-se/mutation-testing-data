  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function passed as the second argument is also different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed as the second argument is different, and it would return a different value for words that match the regular expression pattern.
