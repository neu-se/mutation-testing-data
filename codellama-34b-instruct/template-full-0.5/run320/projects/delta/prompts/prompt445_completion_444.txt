  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `peekLength` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation instead of the current one, which could cause the `peekLength` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current operation instead of the next or previous one, which could cause the `peekLength` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
