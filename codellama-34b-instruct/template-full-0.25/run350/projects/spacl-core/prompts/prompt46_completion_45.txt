  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/.+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character, including the empty string, whereas the original code fragment only matches non-empty strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/.*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character, including the empty string, and would also match the empty string, whereas the original code fragment only matches non-empty strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/.+?/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character, including the empty string, and would also match the empty string, whereas the original code fragment only matches non-empty strings.

DONE.
