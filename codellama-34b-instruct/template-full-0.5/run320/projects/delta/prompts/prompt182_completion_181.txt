  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to return one more op than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to return one fewer op than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to return zero ops, potentially leading to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
