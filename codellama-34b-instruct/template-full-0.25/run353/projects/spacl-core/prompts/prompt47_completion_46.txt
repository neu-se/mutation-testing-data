  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.*` matches any number of characters, including none, whereas the original `.+` matches at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.+?` matches one or more characters, but makes the match non-greedy, so it will stop at the first match, whereas the original `.+` matches one or more characters and is greedy, so it will match as many characters as possible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{1,}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.{1,}` matches one or more characters, but makes the match possessive, so it will not backtrack and try alternative matches, whereas the original `.+` matches one or more characters and is not possessive, so it will backtrack and try alternative matches.

DONE.
