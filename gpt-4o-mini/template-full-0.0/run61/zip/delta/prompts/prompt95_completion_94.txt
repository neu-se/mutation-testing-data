Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the new operation to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of inserting it at the specified index, potentially altering the order of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the operation at the specified index with the new operation instead of inserting it, which could lead to loss of the original operation at that index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the new operation twice to the end of the `ops` array, effectively duplicating the operation instead of inserting it at the specified index.

DONE.
