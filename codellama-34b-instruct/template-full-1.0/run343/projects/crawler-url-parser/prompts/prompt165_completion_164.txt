  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_parts[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking the current part of the URL path, while this code fragment checks the previous part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking the current part of the URL path, while this code fragment always returns true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking the current part of the URL path, while this code fragment always returns false.

DONE.
