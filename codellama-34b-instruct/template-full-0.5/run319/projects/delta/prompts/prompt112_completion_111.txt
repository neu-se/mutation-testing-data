  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an `Op` object, but `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an `Op` object, but `undefined` would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an `Op` object with specific properties, but an empty object `{}` would not have those properties and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
