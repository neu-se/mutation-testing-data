  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called instead of the original `dispatch` function, which would not have the same effect on the program's behavior.

DONE.
