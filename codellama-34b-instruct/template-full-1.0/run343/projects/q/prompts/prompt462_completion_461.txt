  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer be a function call, but rather a loop that would execute the same number of times as the length of the unhandledRejections array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for entering the if statement would be different. Instead of checking if the promise is in the unhandledRejections array, it would check if the index of the promise in the array is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof unhandledRejections === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if the unhandledRejections variable is undefined, rather than if the promise is in the unhandledRejections array.

DONE.
