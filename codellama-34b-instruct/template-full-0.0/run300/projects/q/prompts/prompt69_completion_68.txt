  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `port1` and `port2` are different message ports, and `postMessage` is a method that sends a message to the port. Using `port1` instead of `port2` would cause the message to be sent to a different port, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` takes a message as an argument, and passing `0` as the message would cause the code to behave differently than passing `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` takes a message as an argument, and passing `null` as the message would cause the code to behave differently than passing `undefined`.

DONE.
