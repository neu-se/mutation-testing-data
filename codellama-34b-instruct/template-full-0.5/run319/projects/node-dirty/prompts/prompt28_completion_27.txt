  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would emit an `'error'` event instead of a `'drain'` event, which could cause the application to behave differently when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would emit a `'close'` event instead of a `'drain'` event, which could cause the application to behave differently when the connection is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'destroy'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would emit a `'destroy'` event instead of a `'drain'` event, which could cause the application to behave differently when the connection is destroyed.

DONE.
