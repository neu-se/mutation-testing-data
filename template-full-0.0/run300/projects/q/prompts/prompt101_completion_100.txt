  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not being used, which could cause the callback function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being used with a different `this` value, which could cause the callback function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, [basis, this[index], index])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is being used with a different `this` value, which could cause the callback function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

DONE.
