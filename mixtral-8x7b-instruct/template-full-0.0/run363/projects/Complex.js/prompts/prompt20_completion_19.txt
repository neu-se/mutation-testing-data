 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for equality instead of inequality, and only returns the hypotenuse for the origin (0, 0).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) < 3000 && Math.abs(b) < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the absolute value of `a` and `b`, which would allow larger values with negative signs to pass through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hypot(a, b) < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `hypot` function instead of directly checking the values of `a` and `b`, which could lead to different overflow behavior.

DONE.
