  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"INVALID"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an invalid argument, causing it to return a different timezone object or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a valid argument, but the resulting timezone object would be different from the one returned by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"America/New_York"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a valid argument, but the resulting timezone object would be different from the one returned by the original code fragment.

DONE.
