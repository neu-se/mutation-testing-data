  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.value === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's state, which can be either "fulfilled" or "rejected". By comparing the snapshot's value to the string "fulfilled", we are effectively checking if the promise has been resolved, but we are not checking if it has been rejected. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the `all` function, as it would not handle rejected promises correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's state, which can be either "fulfilled" or "rejected". By comparing the snapshot's state to the string "fulfilled", we are effectively checking if the promise has been resolved, and we are also checking if it has been rejected. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the `all` function, as it would not handle rejected
