  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` expects a number representing the ID of a timeout, while `null` is a value that can never have the same value as any timeout ID. This means that the timeout would never be cleared, leading to unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timeoutId"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string instead of a number, which would cause `clearTimeout` to fail. The timeout would never be cleared, leading to unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different number than the one used to set the timeout, which would cause `clearTimeout` to fail. The timeout would never be cleared, leading to unintended behavior.

DONE.
