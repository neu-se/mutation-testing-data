  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the logarithm would be 11 instead of 10, which would cause the calculation of the complex inverse to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the logarithm would be 9 instead of 10, which would cause the calculation of the complex inverse to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the logarithm would be 1 instead of 10, which would cause the calculation of the complex inverse to be incorrect.

DONE.
