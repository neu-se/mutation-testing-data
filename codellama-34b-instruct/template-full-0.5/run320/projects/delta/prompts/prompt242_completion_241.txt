  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherIter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation in the other iterator plus one, rather than the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherIter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation in the other iterator minus one, rather than the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

DONE.
