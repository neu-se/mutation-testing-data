  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `_flush` method to be called with the `force` parameter set to `true`, which would cause the method to always flush the queue, even if it's not necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `_flush` method to be called with the `force` parameter set to `false`, which would cause the method to only flush the queue if it's necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.size > 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `_flush` method to be called with the `force` parameter set to `true` if the queue is not empty, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
