  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be entered, even if `flushing` was previously set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, so the `if` statement would always be entered, even if `flushing` was previously set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, so the `if` statement would never be entered, even if `flushing` was previously set to `true`.

DONE.
