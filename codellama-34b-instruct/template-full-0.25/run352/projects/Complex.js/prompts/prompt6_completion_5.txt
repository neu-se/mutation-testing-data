  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment is using the unary minus operator, which returns the negative value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment is using the identity function, which returns the same value that is passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment is using the multiplication operator, which returns the product of two numbers.

DONE.
