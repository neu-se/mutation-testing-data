  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, instead of rejecting it, which would cause the `fail` method to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the error, instead of rejecting it, which would cause the `fail` method to not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("new error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject("new error")` would reject the promise with a new error, instead of the original error, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with a different error.

DONE.
