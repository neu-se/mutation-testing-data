  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions || zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipAFolderOptions || zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` always evaluates to `true`, regardless of the value of `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipAFolderOptions && !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` always evaluates to `false`, regardless of the value of `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream ? true : false` always evaluates to `false`, regardless of the value of `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream`.

DONE.
