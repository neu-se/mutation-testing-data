 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function again instead of continuing to the next iteration of the loop, causing potential infinite recursion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the entire process, not just the current function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, undefined)
