  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is forced to be undefined, even if it is not the case in the original code. This change would likely cause the `compose` function to return `undefined` more frequently, even if the inputs are valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is now checked to be a number, even if it is not the case in the original code. This change would likely cause the `compose` function to return incorrect results, especially if the `attributes` input contains non-numeric values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is now checked for equality with an empty object, even if it is not the case in the original code. This change would likely cause the `compose` function to return incorrect results, especially if the `attributes` input
