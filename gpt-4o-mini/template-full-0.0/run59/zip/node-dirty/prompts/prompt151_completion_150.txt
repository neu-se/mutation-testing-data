Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore any error that occurred during the write operation, potentially leading to silent failures where the application does not handle the error appropriately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly signal that the write operation was successful, regardless of whether an error occurred, which could lead to data loss or corruption without any indication of failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string instead of the actual error object, which would not provide the necessary context for error handling and could lead to misleading error messages or improper error handling logic.

DONE.
