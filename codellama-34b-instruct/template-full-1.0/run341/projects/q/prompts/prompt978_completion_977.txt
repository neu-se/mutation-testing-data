  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the new code fragment would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(Q.defer().makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the new code fragment would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function () { }` is not a Node.js-style callback, so the new code fragment would not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
