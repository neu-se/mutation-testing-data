  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(.*)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches if the string starts with "//", while the new code fragment would match any string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^([^/])/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches if the string starts with "//", while the new code fragment would match any string that does not start with "/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^([a-z0-9_-])/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches if the string starts with "//", while the new code fragment would match any string that starts with a letter, number, underscore or hyphen, regardless of case.

DONE.
