 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function expects `thisp` to be the second argument, but passing `null` would change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function expects `thisp` to be an object, but passing a number would change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function expects `thisp` to be an object, but passing a function would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
