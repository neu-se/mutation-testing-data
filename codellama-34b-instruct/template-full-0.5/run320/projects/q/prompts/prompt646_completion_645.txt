  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `this` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(deferred.reject, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(deferred.promise, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `this` object.

DONE.
