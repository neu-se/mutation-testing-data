  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one position, rather than the current position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by two positions, rather than the current position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by three positions, rather than the current position.

DONE.
