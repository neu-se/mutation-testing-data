  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the path, which could change the type of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last part of the path, which could change the type of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the path, which could change the type of the link.

DONE.
