  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method to get the text content of the link, while this replacement uses the `attr()` method to get the `href` attribute of the link, which may not be the same as the text content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method to get the text content of the link, while this replacement uses the `text()` method to get the text content of the link and then trims any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"").trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method to get the text content of the link
