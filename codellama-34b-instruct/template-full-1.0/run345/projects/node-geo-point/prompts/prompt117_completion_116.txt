  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculateDestination method would receive a null value as the first argument, instead of a GeoPoint object, and would likely throw an error or return a null or undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new LatLng(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculateDestination method would receive a different LatLng object as the first argument, which would affect the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculateDestination method would receive an undefined value as the first argument, instead of a GeoPoint object, and would likely throw an error or return a null or undefined value.

DONE.
