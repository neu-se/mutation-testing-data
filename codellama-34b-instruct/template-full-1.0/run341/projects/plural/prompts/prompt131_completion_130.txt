  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) !== 'RegExp' || !rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `test()` method, causing the function to return the original word instead of the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[0] !== 'function' || !rule[0](word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string that describes the type of a value, so `typeof rule[0] !== 'function'` would only be true if `rule[0]` is not a function, regardless of its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'string' && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because `type(rule[0]) === 'string'` would only be true if `rule[0]` is a string, regardless of its value.
