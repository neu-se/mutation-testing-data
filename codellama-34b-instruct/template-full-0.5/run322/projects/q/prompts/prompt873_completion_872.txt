  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` expects a function as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` expects a function as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` expects a function as its first argument, and passing an empty function would cause the promise to be resolved immediately with `undefined`.

DONE.
