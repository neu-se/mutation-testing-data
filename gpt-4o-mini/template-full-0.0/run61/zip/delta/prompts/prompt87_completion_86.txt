Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always compare `newOp.attributes` with an empty object, which will always return false unless `newOp.attributes` is also an empty object, thus potentially skipping the merging logic for attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes, newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it will compare `lastOp.attributes` with `newOp.attributes`, which could lead to incorrect merging of operations if the attributes are not the same, potentially causing unexpected results in the final operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes, lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares `newOp.attributes` with `lastOp.insert`, which are fundamentally different types (object vs. string/number), leading to a false comparison and preventing the merging of operations based on attributes.

DONE.
