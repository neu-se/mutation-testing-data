  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trim any whitespace at the beginning and end of the string, while the original code does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the string, while the original code does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/[A-Z]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any uppercase letters from the string, while the original code does not.

DONE.
