  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed in a more forgiving way, and the `parsedUrl` object would not have the `query` property set to `null` if there is no query string in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `null` option, which means that the URL would be parsed in a more strict way, and the `parsedUrl` object would have the `query` property set to `null` if there is no query string in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `undefined` option, which means that the URL would be parsed in a more forgiving way,
