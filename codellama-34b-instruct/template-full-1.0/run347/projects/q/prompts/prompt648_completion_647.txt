  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be able to access the `name` argument, which would cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the function would be in the wrong order, which would cause the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0], args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passing a single argument (the first element of the `args` array), rather than the entire `args` array, which would cause it to fail.

DONE.
