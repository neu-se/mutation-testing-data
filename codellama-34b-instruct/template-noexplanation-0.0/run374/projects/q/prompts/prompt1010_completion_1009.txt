  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This change will cause the `nodeArgs` array to include one more argument than the original code, which may cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This change will cause the `nodeArgs` array to include one fewer argument than the original code, which may cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, "foo"
```
This change will cause the `nodeArgs` array to include a string value instead of a number, which may cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

DONE.
