  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be checked for illegal characters, rather than the `currentUrlStr` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be checked for legal characters, rather than the `currentUrlStr` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `currentUrlStr` to be checked for illegal characters, rather than the `baseUrlStr` as intended.

DONE.
