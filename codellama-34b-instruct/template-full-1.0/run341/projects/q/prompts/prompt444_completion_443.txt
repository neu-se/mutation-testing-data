  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the inspect() method would return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator would return a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the chain of promises.

DONE.
