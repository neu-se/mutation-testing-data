  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will change the sign of the value of `a`, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator will square the value of `a`, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root function will return the positive square root of the value of `a`, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
