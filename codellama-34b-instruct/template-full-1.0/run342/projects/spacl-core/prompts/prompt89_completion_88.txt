  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.type, policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` property is different from the `name` property in the `Policy` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.type]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element in the array is now `policy.type` instead of `policy`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element in the array is now `policy * 2` instead of `policy`.

DONE.
