  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `,` operator has a lower precedence than the `,` operator, so the code would be evaluated as `f(arguments)` instead of `f(arguments, {})`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f(), arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `f` function would be called with the `arguments` object as an argument, instead of with the `f` function as an argument and the `arguments` object as a property of the `f` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f(arguments[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `f` function would be called with the first element of the `arguments` array, instead of with the whole `arguments` object.

DONE.
