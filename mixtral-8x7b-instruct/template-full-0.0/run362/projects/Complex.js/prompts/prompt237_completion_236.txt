 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result would be flipped, which could cause the test suite to fail when checking the equality of the expected and actual results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the reciprocal of the absolute value of the imaginary part would be used, which could cause the test suite to fail when checking the equality of the expected and actual results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of the absolute value of the imaginary part would be used, which could cause the test suite to fail when checking the equality of the expected and actual results.

DONE.
