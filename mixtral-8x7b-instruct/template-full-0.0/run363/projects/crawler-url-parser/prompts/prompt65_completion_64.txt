 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
psl.parse('example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a hardcoded value for the domain instead of using the parsed host value. This could cause issues if the URL being parsed has a different domain than 'example.com'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the domain and subdomain properties to null, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access these properties later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
