  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[foo, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because foo is not defined, so it would throw a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the arguments array, which could cause problems if the function relies on that element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip two elements of the arguments array, which could cause problems if the function relies on those elements.

DONE.
