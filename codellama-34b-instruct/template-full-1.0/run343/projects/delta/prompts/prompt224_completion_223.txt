  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Library"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting to receive a number (cursor position) as an argument, but the string "Library" would be interpreted as 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting to receive a cursor position as an argument, which would be used to calculate the next cursor position after deletion. However, the value 1000 is too large and would result in an out-of-bounds cursor position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting to receive a cursor position as an argument, which would be used to calculate the next cursor position after deletion. However, the value -1 would result in an out-of-bounds cursor position.

DONE.
