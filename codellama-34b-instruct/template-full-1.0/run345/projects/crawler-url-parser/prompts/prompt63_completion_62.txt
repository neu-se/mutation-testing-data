  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ret.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the expression, making it always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `ret.host`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` is a different property than `ret.host`, and it may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.href` is the full URL of the link, while `ret.host` is just the hostname of the link.

DONE.
