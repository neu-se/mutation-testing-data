Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number, which would change the scaling factor used in the `ceil` method, potentially leading to incorrect rounding of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, which would alter the intended behavior of the `ceil` method, causing it to always round down instead of up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which would not provide the correct scaling factor for the `ceil` method, leading to incorrect results when attempting to round the complex number.

DONE.
