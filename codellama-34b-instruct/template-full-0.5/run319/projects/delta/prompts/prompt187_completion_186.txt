  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => { throw new Error('getHandler not implemented'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a handler for the given operation, while this new code fragment is a function that throws an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => { return null; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a handler for the given operation, while this new code fragment is a function that returns null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => { return 'invalid'; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a handler for the given operation, while this new code fragment is a function that returns a string.

DONE.
