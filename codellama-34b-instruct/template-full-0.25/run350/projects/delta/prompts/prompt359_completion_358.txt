  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the `priority` boolean, causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `priority` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `priority` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `priority` is false.

DONE.
