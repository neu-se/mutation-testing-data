  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be called with `undefined` as the value, which would overwrite the original value of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be called with the key as an argument, which would return the value of the property instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hasOwnProperty", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called with the key as an argument, which would return a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property.

DONE.
