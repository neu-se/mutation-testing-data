  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while the original code fragment `nodeArgs` returns a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging the original array with the given array, while the original code fragment `nodeArgs` returns a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the original code fragment `nodeArgs` returns a reference to the original array.

DONE.
