  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define['amd']` property would be `undefined`, causing the `define` function to be called with an empty array and a function that returns `Complex`, which would not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define['amd']` property would be `null`, causing the `define` function to be called with an empty array and a function that returns `Complex`, which would not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define['amd']` property would be the string `'undefined'`, causing the `define` function to be called with an empty
