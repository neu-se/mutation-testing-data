  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes from the string, which could cause the matcher to not match the expected path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.replace(/\/+/g, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any sequence of one or more forward slashes with a single forward slash, which could cause the matcher to not match the expected path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.replace(/[^\/]+/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any sequence of one or more non-forward slash characters, which could cause the matcher to not match the expected path.

DONE.
