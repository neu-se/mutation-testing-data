Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a || 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical condition from requiring both properties to be present to requiring only one of them, potentially allowing invalid objects to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a.re !== undefined && a.im !== undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of properties in a different way, which could lead to false negatives if the properties exist but are set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a['re'] === 'number' && typeof a['im'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the check from verifying property existence to checking their types, which could allow objects without the properties to pass through if they are not numbers.

DONE.
