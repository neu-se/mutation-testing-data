  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basename` variable is not the same as the `decodedBasename` variable, which is the result of decoding the URL's pathname. Using `basename` instead of `decodedBasename` would result in a different file name being used for the downloaded image.

DONE.
