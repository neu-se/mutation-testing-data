  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt2` code fragment uses a different regular expression to extract the file name and line number from the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt3` code fragment uses a different regular expression to extract the file name and line number from the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attempt1` code fragment uses a different regular expression to extract the file name and line number from the stack trace.

DONE.
