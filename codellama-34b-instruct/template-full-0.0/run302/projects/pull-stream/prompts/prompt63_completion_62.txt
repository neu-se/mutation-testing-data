  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `end` to `true` if both `end` and `abort` are `true`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `end` to `true` if either `end` or `abort` are `true`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

DONE.
