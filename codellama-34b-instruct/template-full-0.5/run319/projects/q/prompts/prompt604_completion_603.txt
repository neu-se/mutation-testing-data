  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Some error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `then` method to be called with the error as an argument instead of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of the result, which would cause the `then` method to be called with `undefined` as an argument instead of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(new Error("Some error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an error instead of the result, which would cause the `then` method to be called with the error as an argument instead of the result.

DONE.
