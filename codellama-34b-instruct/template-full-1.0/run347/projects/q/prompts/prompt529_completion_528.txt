  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { state: "fulfilled", value: value };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `inspect` function with a function that always returns the same `{ state: "fulfilled", value: value }` object, regardless of the actual state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { state: "pending", reason: undefined };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `inspect` function with a function that always returns a pending promise with no reason, regardless of the actual state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { state: "rejected", reason: new Error("intentional") };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `inspect` function with a function that always returns a rejected promise with a new `Error` object as the reason, regardless of the actual state of the promise.

DONE.
