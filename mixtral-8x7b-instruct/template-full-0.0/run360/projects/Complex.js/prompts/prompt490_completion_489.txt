 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { "value": false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of \_\_esModule to false, which could affect how the module is imported and used in other parts of the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "Complex", { "value": Complex, "enumerable": true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the Complex object enumerable, which could affect how it is iterated over or accessed in other parts of the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { "value": true, "configurable": true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the \_\_esModule property configurable, which could allow it to be modified or deleted in other parts of the application.
