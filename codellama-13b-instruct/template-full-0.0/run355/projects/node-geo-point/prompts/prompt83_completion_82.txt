  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `φ2` is not defined in the original code, and therefore the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `cosφ1` is not defined in the original code, and therefore the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `sinφ1` is not defined in the original code, and therefore the code would throw a ReferenceError.

DONE.
