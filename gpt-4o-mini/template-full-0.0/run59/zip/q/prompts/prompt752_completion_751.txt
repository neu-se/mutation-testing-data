Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("All promises were rejected.")
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object with a static message instead of using the last error message from the rejected promise, which may provide more context about the failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` would cause the promise to reject without any error message, making it difficult for the caller to understand why the rejection occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `message` property of the `rejection` object, which may not exist if `err` is `null` or `undefined`, potentially leading to a TypeError instead of a proper rejection.

DONE.
