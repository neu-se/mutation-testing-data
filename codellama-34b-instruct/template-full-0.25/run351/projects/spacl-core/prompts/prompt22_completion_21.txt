  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a substring of the input string, starting from the second character, which would cause the regular expression to match a different pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove all alphanumeric characters and underscores from the input string, which would cause the regular expression to match a different pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the input string, which would cause the regular expression to match a different pattern.

DONE.
