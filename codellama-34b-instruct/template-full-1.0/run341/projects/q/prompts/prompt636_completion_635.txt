  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise, whereas `dispatch` is a method that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a method that throws an error and returns a rejected promise, whereas `dispatch` is a method that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a method that throws an error and returns a rejected promise, whereas `dispatch` is a method that returns a resolved promise. Additionally, `Promise.prototype.throw` is a method that does not exist in the `Promise` constructor, so it would result in a `TypeError` if used.

DONE.
