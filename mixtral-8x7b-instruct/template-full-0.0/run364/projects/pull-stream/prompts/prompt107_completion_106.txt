 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, done
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of immediately calling the `drain` function, it would pass `false` as the first argument, which might cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `done` function when the `drain` function has completed, it would call an empty function, which would not indicate to the test suite that the `onEnd` function has finished executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, done
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing `null` as the first argument to the `drain` function, it would pass `1`, which might cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

DONE.
