  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, which would cause the `deferred.resolve()` call to be skipped, resulting in the promise not being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, which would cause the `deferred.resolve()` call to be made, resulting in the promise being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("error"))` creates a rejected promise with a specific error message, which would cause the `deferred.resolve()` call to be skipped, resulting in the promise not being resolved.

DONE.
