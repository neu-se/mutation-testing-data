  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is expected to return `false` when the iteration should stop, but replacing it with `true` would cause the iteration to continue even when it should stop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is expected to return `false` when the iteration should stop, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the iteration to continue even when it should stop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is expected to return `false` when the iteration should stop, but replacing it with `null` would cause the iteration to continue even when it should stop.

DONE.
