  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the trigonometric function `cos` would be flipped, which would change the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the trigonometric function `cos` would be increased, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the trigonometric function `cos` would be doubled, which would change the result.

DONE.
