  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a different object than the original `promise` object. This could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a different object than the original `promise` object. This could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is a different object than the original `promise` object.
