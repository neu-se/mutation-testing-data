  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("This is a buggy function"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "This is a buggy function"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return function () { throw new Error("This is a buggy function"); }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a function that throws an error instead of a function that returns a value.

DONE.
