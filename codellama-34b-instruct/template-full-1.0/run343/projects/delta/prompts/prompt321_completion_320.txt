  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a `delete` property, while this new code fragment only checks whether `op.retain` is an object. If `op.retain` is a number, the new code fragment would return `true`, even though the original code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.delete && typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a `delete` property, while this new code fragment only checks whether `op.retain` is a number. If `op.retain` is an object, the new code fragment would return `false`, even though the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
