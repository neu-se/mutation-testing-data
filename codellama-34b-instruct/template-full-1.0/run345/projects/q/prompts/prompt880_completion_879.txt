  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects zero arguments, but `42` would be passed as an argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that is bound to a particular context and arguments, but the returned function would not have the same behavior as the original `makeNodeResolver` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject<any>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.reject` function returns a rejected promise, which would cause the test to fail, but the original code would not.

DONE.
