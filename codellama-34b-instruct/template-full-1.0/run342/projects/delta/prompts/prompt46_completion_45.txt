  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the values of the properties of the object instead of the properties themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of [key, value] pairs for each property of the object instead of the properties themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the names of the properties of the object instead of the properties themselves.

DONE.
