  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would switch the positions of the `a` and `b` variables in the `logHypot` function, leading to a different value for the `re` component of the returned `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `a` and `b` variables in the `logHypot` function, leading to a different value for the `re` component of the returned `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `b` variable by itself in the `logHypot` function, leading to a different value for the `re` component of the returned `Complex` object.

DONE.
