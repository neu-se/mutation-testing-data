Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/person$/, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "person" to "persons" instead of the correct "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/person$/, 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the incorrect plural form "peoples" instead of "people", which is not a standard pluralization for "person".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/person$/, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'eople' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly transforms "person" into "eople", which is not a valid plural form.

DONE.
