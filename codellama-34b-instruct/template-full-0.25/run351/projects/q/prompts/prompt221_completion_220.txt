  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with a different prototype than the original code, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the original prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with a different prototype than the original code, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the original prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw a TypeError when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method of the `resolvedPromise` object, which is assumed to be a promise.

DONE.
