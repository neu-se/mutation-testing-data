 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method that returns a boolean indicating if the provided string matches the regular expression, while `exec` returns the first match or `null` if no match is found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toString().exec
