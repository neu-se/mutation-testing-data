  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `isInternalFrame(line)`
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the line number is within the range of qStartingLine and qEndingLine which may not be the case for isNodeFrame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)`
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if the line number is within the range of qStartingLine and qEndingLine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `true`
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the stackLine contains a filename and lineNumber that isn't within the range of qStartingLine and qEndingLine.

DONE.
