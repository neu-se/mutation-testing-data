 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lines[1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf method would be called on the second element of the lines array instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"PLACEHOLDER".indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf method would be called on a string literal instead of the lines array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getFileNameAndLineNumber.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf method would be called on the getFileNameAndLineNumber function instead of the lines array.

DONE.
