  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `b` and potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `b` and potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` would change the value of `b` and potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value.

DONE.
