  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.resolve()` method would resolve the path relative to the current working directory, rather than the directory containing the module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
".."
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.resolve()` method would resolve the path relative to the parent directory of the current working directory, rather than the directory containing the module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/tmp"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.resolve()` method would resolve the path relative to the `/tmp` directory, rather than the directory containing the module.

DONE.
