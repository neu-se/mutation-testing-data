 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the real part of the current complex number is equal to positive infinity, instead of checking if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the real part of the input complex number is equal to positive infinity, instead of checking if the input complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']() || z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the current complex number is zero or if the real part of the input complex number is equal to positive infinity, which is not equivalent to checking if the input complex number is infinite.

DONE.
