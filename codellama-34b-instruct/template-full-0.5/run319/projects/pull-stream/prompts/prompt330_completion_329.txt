  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `data` value, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the `data` value, which would also change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the `data` value by 2, which would also change the output of the function.

DONE.
