  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression always evaluates to `undefined`, which would cause the `finally` callback to be called immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` expression always evaluates to `null`, which would cause the `finally` callback to be called immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` expression always evaluates to `undefined`, which would cause the `finally` callback to be called immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
