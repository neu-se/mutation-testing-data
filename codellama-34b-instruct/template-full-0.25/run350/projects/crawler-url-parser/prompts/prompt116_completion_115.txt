  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` method returns an array of the map's values, but the `baseUrlStr` variable is not a map, it's a string. This would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values(baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` method returns an array of the map's values, but the `baseUrl` variable is not a map, it's an object. This would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values(urlMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` method returns an array of the map's values, but the `urlMap` variable is already an array of the map's values. This would cause an error.

DONE.
