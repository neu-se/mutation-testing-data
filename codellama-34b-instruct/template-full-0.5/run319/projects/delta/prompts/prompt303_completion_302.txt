  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next element, potentially skipping over the element that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the next element without advancing to it, potentially causing the same element to be processed multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward to the previous element, potentially skipping over elements that should be processed.

DONE.
