  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` together, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `a` from `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
