  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `length` elements, potentially skipping over some elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 0 elements, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backwards by `length` elements, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely or skipping over some elements.

DONE.
