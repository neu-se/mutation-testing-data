  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if the arguments are not used in the correct order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the function, which could cause it to behave differently if it is not expecting that argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the function, which could cause it to behave differently if it is not expecting that argument.

DONE.
