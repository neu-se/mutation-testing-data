  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` method checks if two values are equal, while the `isNotEqual` method checks if two values are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual(arg, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` method checks if two values are equal, while the `isNotEqual` method checks if two values are not equal, and the additional `0` argument would cause the method to check for inequality with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual(arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` method checks if two values are equal, while the `isNotEqual` method checks if two values are not equal, and the additional `arg` argument would cause the method to check for inequality with the same value, which would always return `false`.

DONE.
