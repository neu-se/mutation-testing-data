  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is the same as the original, which would cause the test to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
