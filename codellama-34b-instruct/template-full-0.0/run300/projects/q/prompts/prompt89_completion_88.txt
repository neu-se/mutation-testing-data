  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not being passed as a separate argument, but rather as the first element of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not being passed as a separate argument, but rather as the second element of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not being passed as a separate argument, but rather as the third element of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
