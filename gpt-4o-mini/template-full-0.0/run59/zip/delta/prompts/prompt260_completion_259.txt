Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the same `insert` property of `thisOp` with itself instead of comparing `thisOp.insert` with `otherOp.insert`, potentially leading to incorrect equality checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain, thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it switches the comparison to the `retain` properties of both operations, which may not be relevant to the context of the `insert` operations, leading to incorrect logic in the equality check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the `delete` property of `thisOp` with the `insert` property of `otherOp`, which are fundamentally different operations and would likely lead to incorrect handling of the delta operations.

DONE.
