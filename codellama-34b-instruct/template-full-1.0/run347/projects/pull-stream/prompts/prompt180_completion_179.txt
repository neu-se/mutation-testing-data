  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the truthiness of the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a short-circuiting logical AND, which would return `false` if the first operand is falsy, regardless of the truthiness of the second operand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a short-circuiting logical OR, which would return `true` if the first operand is truthy, regardless of the truthiness of the second operand.

DONE.
