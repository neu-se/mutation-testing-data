 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a valid `this` value, and passing `null` would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a valid `this` value, and passing an empty array would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a valid `this` value, and passing an empty object would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
