  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail if the data contains leading or trailing whitespace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method converts all characters in a string to uppercase, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail if the data contains any lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method splits a string into an array of substrings, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail if the data contains any escape characters or special characters.

DONE.
