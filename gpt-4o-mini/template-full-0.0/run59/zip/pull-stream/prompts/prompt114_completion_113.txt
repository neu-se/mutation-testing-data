Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `null` as the error, which may lead to incorrect handling of errors in the calling code, potentially masking the actual error that occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string `'error'` as the error argument to the callback, which is not a valid error object and could lead to unexpected behavior when the callback attempts to process the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the error would not trigger any error handling logic in the callback, potentially leading to situations where the caller assumes there was no error when one actually occurred.

DONE.
