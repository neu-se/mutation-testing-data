  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'warning'`, which would not trigger the same event listeners as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error' + 'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with the string `'warning'`, which would result in a different event name being emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with the number `1`, which would result in a different event name being emitted.

DONE.
