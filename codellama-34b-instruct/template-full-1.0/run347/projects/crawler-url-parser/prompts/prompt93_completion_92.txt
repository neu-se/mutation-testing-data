  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsestring
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsestring` is a function that takes a URL string as an argument and returns a parsed URL object, while `parse` is a function that takes a URL object as an argument and returns a normalized URL string. Using `parsestring` in place of `parse` would cause the code to treat the URL as a string, rather than an object, which could produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decode URI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decode URI` is a function that takes a URL-encoded string as an argument and returns the decoded string, while `parse` is a function that takes a URL object as an argument and returns a normalized URL string. Using `decode URI` in place of `parse` would cause the code to treat the URL as an encoded string, rather than an object, which could produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
