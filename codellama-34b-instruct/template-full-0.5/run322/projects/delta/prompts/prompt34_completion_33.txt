  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` checks if `a` is null, while `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === undefined` checks if `a` is undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null || a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null || a === undefined` checks if `a` is either null or undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
