  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects in the `Object.keys()` method, which could cause the resulting `attributes` object to have a different set of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of the `a` and `b` objects together, which could cause the resulting `attributes` object to have different values for the same keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the values of the `b` object from the `a` object, which could cause the resulting `attributes` object to have different values for the same keys.

DONE.
