  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain` would retain the deleted content, while `inverted.delete` would delete it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.insert` would insert the deleted content, while `inverted.delete` would delete it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.push` would push the deleted content onto the inverted delta, while `inverted.delete` would delete it.

DONE.
