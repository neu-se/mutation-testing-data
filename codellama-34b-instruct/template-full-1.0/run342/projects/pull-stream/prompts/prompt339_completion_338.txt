  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++field
```
This would result in different behavior because `++` is a prefix increment operator, which means that the value of `field` would be incremented by 1 before it is used in the code. This would change the behavior of the function, potentially causing it to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would also result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `field`, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would also result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `field`, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
