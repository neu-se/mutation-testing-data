Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the destination path relative to itself instead of the current directory, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the destination path relative to the current working directory of the Node.js process, which may not be the same as the directory of the current module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(__dirname, 'defaultDest')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append 'defaultDest' to the current directory, ignoring the actual destination provided in the options, which could lead to files being saved in an unintended location.

DONE.
