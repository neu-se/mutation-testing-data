 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(nextOp.insert, offset, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the insert string with the offset and length instead of using the substr method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.slice(offset, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the slice method instead of substr, which may have different behavior depending on the JavaScript engine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.split('')[offset].repeat(length)
