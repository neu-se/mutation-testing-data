  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This change will cause the code to always enter the `if` block, even if the character is not a plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This change will cause the code to never enter the `if` block, even if the character is a minus sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block only if the character is an asterisk, and not if it is a minus sign.

DONE.
