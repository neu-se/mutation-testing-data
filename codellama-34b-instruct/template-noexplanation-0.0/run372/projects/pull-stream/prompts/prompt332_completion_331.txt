  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with `false` as the argument, which will not trigger the `onEnd` callback. This change will not affect the behavior of the `through` function, but it will cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `onEnd` callback being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with `true` as the argument, which will trigger the `onEnd` callback. This change will not affect the behavior of the `through` function, but it will cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `onEnd` callback being called with a specific argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && onEnd
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with the `onEnd` callback as the argument, which will trigger the `onEnd` callback.
