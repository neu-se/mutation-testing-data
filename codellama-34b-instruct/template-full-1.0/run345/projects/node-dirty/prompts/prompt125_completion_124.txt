  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `emit` method without any arguments, which would be a no-op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.emit();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `emit` method on the `_data` object, which may not have the same behavior as calling the same method on `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.emit();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `emit` method on the `_writeStream` object, which may not have the same behavior as calling the same method on `this`.

Please let me know if you need more options or have further questions.

DONE.
