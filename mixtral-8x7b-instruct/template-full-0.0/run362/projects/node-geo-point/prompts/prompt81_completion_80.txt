 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the longitude to 0, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the longitude to a random value between 0 and 1, instead of using the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the longitude to the same value as the latitude, instead of using the input value.

DONE.
