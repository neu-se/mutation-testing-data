  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` will return the length of the `this` object, which is the `Iterator` instance, while `this.index` returns the index of the current `Op` in the `ops` array. This could cause the `rest()` method to return a different result, which would likely cause the unit tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index + 1` would return the index of the next `Op` in the `ops` array, which is not equivalent to `this.index`. If the `ops` array is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `this.index` would return `0`, `this.index + 1` would return `1`, and `this.index + 2` would return `2`. This could cause the `rest()` method to return a different result, which would likely cause the unit tests to
