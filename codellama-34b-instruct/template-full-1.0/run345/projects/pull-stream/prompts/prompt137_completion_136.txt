  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned `cb(end)`, but the mutated code would return `cb(end + 1)`, which would cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
In this mutation, the `generate()` function call is removed, causing the function to always return `null` instead of a random number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
In this mutation, the `end` parameter is removed from the `cb()` function call, causing the function to be called with less arguments than it expects, potentially causing an exception.

DONE.
