  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter` iterator, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to only iterate over the `thisIter` iterator if the next operation is a delete operation, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to only iterate over the `otherIter` iterator if the next operation is an insert operation, potentially leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
