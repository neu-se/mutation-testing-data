Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(options);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the `options` object, bypassing the actual request logic and potentially leading to incorrect handling of the image processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request(options.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `request` function with only the `url` property of `options`, ignoring other necessary properties like `dest`, which could lead to incomplete or erroneous behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request(options.dest);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pass the `dest` property to the `request` function instead of the expected `options`, which could lead to unexpected results or errors during the request process.

DONE.
