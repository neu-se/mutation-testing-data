  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `string.endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.includes` checks if the string contains the given substring, while `string.endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the given substring, while `string.endsWith` checks if the string ends with the given substring.

DONE.
