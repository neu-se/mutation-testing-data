  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because `_value` is a function call, while `cb` is a function reference, and the function call would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(false)` would invoke the callback function with a different value than `cb`, which would affect the state of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(null, _value)` would invoke the callback function with different arguments than `cb`, which would affect the state of the program.

DONE.
