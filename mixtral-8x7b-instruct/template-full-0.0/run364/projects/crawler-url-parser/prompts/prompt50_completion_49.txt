 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://' + parsedBaseUrl.host + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs the absolute URL by concatenating the base URL's host with the parsed URL's path, instead of using the `URL.resolve` method which takes care of resolving the relative URL against the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedBaseUrl.protocol + '://' + parsedBaseUrl.host + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it manually concatenates the base URL's protocol, host, and the parsed URL's path, instead of using the `URL.resolve` method which handles the protocol and other edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedBaseUrl.origin + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `origin` property of the base URL object and concatenates it with the
