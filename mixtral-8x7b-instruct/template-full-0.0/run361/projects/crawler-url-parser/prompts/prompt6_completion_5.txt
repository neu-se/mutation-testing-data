 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method might return a string with extra whitespace or other characters that are not part of the original URL, potentially causing the `_has_illegal_chars()` function to return a false positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, potentially changing the behavior of the `_has_illegal_chars()` function if the illegal characters are located at the beginning or end of the URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts all the characters in the string to lowercase, potentially causing the `_has_illegal_chars()` function to return a false negative if
