 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"GET"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the promise to always reject instead of correctly handling the "get" operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access the `[key]` property of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => "get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `get` method from returning the value of a property to always returning the string "get".

DONE.
