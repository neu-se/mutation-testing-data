Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
','
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter used to split the `spec` string, which would lead to incorrect parsing of the path specification and potentially generate an invalid regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/|'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an alternative pattern that would incorrectly split the `spec` string, leading to unexpected results in the regex compilation and potentially allowing invalid paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spec` string to be split at every character, resulting in a malformed regex that does not correctly represent the intended path structure.

DONE.
