  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` would remove characters from the right side of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the left side.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would remove the first character of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes whitespace characters from the left side.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace(/^\s+/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` would remove all whitespace characters from the beginning of the string, whereas `trimLeft` only removes whitespace characters from the left side.

DONE.
