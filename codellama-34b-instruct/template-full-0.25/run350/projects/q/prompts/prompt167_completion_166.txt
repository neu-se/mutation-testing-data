  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition is initially false and would not change during the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, as the condition would always be true and the loop variable would decrease indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = lines.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, as the condition would be initially true and the loop variable would be set to the last index of the array.

DONE.
