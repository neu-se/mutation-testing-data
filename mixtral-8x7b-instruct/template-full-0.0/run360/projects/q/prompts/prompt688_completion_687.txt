 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value, which may not be the same as the original `this` value when the mutated code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
