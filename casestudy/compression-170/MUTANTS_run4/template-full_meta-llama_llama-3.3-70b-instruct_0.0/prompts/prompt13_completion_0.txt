Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHead(this.statusCode + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the status code sent in the response, potentially affecting how the response is handled by the client or subsequent middleware.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a 'Content-Type' header, overwriting any existing 'Content-Type' header and potentially changing how the response body is interpreted by the client, instead of writing the response headers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `flush` method on the response object, which is used to flush the response stream, instead of writing the response headers, potentially affecting the timing and ordering of the response.

DONE.
