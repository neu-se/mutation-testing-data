  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` array starting from the second element, while the new code fragment slices it starting from the first element. This would cause the `name` argument to be included in the `args` array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
