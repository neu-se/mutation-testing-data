  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, rather than an array containing the arguments passed to the `nfapply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing the empty array `[]`, rather than an array containing the arguments passed to the `nfapply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing the concatenation of the empty array `[]` and the `arguments` object, rather than an array containing the arguments passed to the `nfapply` method.

DONE.
