  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for the presence of "module.js" in the stack trace, but this change would also check for "node.js".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of "module.js" in the stack trace, but this change would check for its absence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of "module.js" in the stack trace, but this change would check for its position in the string.

DONE.
