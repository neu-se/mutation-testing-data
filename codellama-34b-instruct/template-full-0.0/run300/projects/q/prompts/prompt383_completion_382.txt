  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is not a valid method for a promise, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.then(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not a valid method for a promise, and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is not a valid method for a promise, and would cause an error.

DONE.
