  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, but `null` is not an array. In the original code, `arguments` is passed as the second argument, which is an array-like object containing the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to throw an error.
