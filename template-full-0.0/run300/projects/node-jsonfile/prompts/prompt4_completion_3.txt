  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse `null` as JSON.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value. The `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse `undefined` as JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object. The `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse an empty object as JSON.

DONE.
