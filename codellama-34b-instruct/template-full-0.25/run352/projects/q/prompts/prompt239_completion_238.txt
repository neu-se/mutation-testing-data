  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original promise object instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise object that is resolved with the resolved value of the original promise.

DONE.
