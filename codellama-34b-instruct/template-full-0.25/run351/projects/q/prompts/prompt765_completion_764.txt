  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the callback function, which is the same value that was passed to the callback. This would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the same value that was passed to the callback, rather than the value that was passed to the `resolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the callback function, which is the value passed to the callback plus 1. This would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the one that was passed to the `resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value *
