  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "this['im']", this would result in different behavior because "this['im']" will return the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas "this['re']" returns the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "0", this would result in different behavior because "0" is not a complex number and does not have an imaginary or real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "1", this would result in different behavior because "1" is not a complex number and does not have an imaginary or real part.

DONE.
