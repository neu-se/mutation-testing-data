  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is an object, and `attr` is a property of that object. In the original code, `attr` is being used as a key to access the `base` object, but if we replace it with `base`, we would be trying to access the `base` property of the `base` object, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attr[key]` is a property of the `attr` object, but `base[key]` is a property of the `base` object. In the original code, we are comparing the values of `attr[key]` and `base[key]`, but if we replace `base[key]` with `attr[key]`, we would be comparing the values of the same property, which would always be equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key]
```
