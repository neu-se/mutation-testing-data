  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persona'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'persona' is not recognized as a valid word for pluralization, leading to the wrong output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persona' || 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator will evaluate to true if 'persona' is undefined or null, leading to the 'people' output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra 's' at the end of 'person', leading to the wrong output.

DONE.
