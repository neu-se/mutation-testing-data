  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw` is a boolean variable that indicates whether an exception was thrown, and it is negated in the original code fragment. By using `threw` directly, the code would always enter the `if` block and call `deferred.notify(newValue)`, which is not the intended behavior.
