  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's current state, which would be "rejected" if the promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's current state, which would be "pending" if the promise was still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's current state, which would be "fulfilled" if the promise was fulfilled.

DONE.
