 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = this.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the array in reverse order, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i += this.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to `this.length` and then decrements it, causing the loop to not execute at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = this.length; i > 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a `let` declaration instead of `var`, which may cause issues if the value of `i` needs to be accessed outside the loop. Additionally, it decrements `i` after checking the condition, which may cause the loop to execute one more time than intended.

DONE.
