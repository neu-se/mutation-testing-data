  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.insert` property is a string, while the original code fragment `otherOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the `otherOp` object is expected to be treated as a string in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.attributes` property is an object, while the original code fragment `otherOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the `otherOp` object is expected to be treated as an object in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.retain` property is a number, while the original code fragment `otherOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the `otherOp` object is expected to be treated as a number in
