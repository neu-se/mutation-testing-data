Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(hours)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the hours to a positive value regardless of the sign of the offset, potentially leading to incorrect UTC offset strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add one hour to the calculated hours, resulting in an inaccurate representation of the UTC offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(hours)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the hours to a string without formatting, which could lead to unexpected output in the UTC offset string, such as omitting the leading zero for single-digit hours.

DONE.
