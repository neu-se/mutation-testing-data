  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first character of the word, instead of the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the word, instead of the last two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first character of the word, instead of the last two characters.

DONE.
