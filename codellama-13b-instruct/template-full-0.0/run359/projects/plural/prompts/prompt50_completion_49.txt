  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with a consonant followed by "o", while the new code fragment matches words that end with "o" regardless of the preceding consonant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-insensitive, while the new code fragment is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with a consonant followed by "o", while the new code fragment matches words that end with "o" regardless of the preceding consonant.

DONE.
