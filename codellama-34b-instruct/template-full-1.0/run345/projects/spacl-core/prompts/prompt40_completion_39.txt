  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('+')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, while the original code fragment returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.slice(1).reverse().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method returns a string representation of the reversed substring, while the original code fragment returns an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/(\+|[*][*]|[*]|[?]|\*|:.+|\/).*/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns an array of matches, while the original code fragment returns an array of substrings.

DONE.
