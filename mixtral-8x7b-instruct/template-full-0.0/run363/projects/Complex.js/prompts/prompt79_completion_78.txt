 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '' || c === '\t' || c === '\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat an empty string as whitespace, potentially causing issues in the parsing of complex numbers from strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat carriage return characters as whitespace, potentially causing issues in the parsing of complex numbers from strings in certain environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'x' || c === '\t' || c === '\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the character 'x' as whitespace, potentially causing issues in the parsing of complex numbers from strings.

DONE.
