  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the buffer on every newline character, whereas this replacement splits the buffer on every newline character and returns an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the buffer on every newline character, whereas this replacement splits the buffer on every space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('|')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the buffer on every newline character, whereas this replacement splits the buffer on every pipe character.

DONE.
