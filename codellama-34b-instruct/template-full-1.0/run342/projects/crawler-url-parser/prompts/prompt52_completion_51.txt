  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, undefined))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve` function would return `baseUrlStr` instead of the resolved URL, which would result in `parsedUrl.host` being undefined, causing the function to return `null` instead of the expected URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve` function would return `baseUrlStr` instead of the resolved
