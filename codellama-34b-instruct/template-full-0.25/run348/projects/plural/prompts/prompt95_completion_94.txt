  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, causing the regex to match only lowercase "man" and "woman", while the original regex would match both uppercase and lowercase versions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, causing the regex to match both uppercase and lowercase versions, while the original regex would only match lowercase "man" and "woman".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, causing the regex to match both uppercase and lowercase versions, while the original regex would only match lowercase "man" and "woman".

DONE.
