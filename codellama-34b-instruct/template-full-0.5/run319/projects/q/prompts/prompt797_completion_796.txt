  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function, unlike `void 0` which is a function that returns `undefined`. This change would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `null` as the `this` value, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the `progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function, unlike `void 0` which is a function that returns `undefined`. This change would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `undefined` as the `this` value, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the `progressed` function.
