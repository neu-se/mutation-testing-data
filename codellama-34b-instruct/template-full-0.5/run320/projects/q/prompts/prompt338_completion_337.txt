  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` function to be called twice, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` function to be called with a different `this` value, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.apply(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` function to be called with a different `this` value and a different set of arguments, which could affect its behavior.

DONE.
