Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent
```
This would result in different behavior because `destParent` is the parent directory of the destination, whereas `path.parse` is a function that parses a path. This change would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is its own root directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a built-in JavaScript constructor, whereas `path.parse` is a function that parses a path. This change would cause a TypeError when trying to access the `root` property of the `String` constructor, which does not exist.

DONE.
