  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

DONE.
