  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the presence of a space character and the absence of a number, while this replacement only checks for the presence of a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the presence of a space character and the absence of a number, while this replacement only checks for the presence of the letter 'i'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the presence of a space character and the absence of a number, while this replacement only checks for the presence of the letter 'I'.

DONE.
