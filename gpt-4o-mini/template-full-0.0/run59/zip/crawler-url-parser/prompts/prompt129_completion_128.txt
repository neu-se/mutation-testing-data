Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` attempts to convert the `pageurl` string to an integer, which would lead to incorrect processing of the URL and potentially cause errors or unexpected results in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl + "extra")
```
This would result in different behavior because appending "extra" to the `pageurl` string before parsing would change the structure of the URL, leading to incorrect parsing and potentially causing the function to return an unexpected type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `parse` function would likely cause it to return an invalid or undefined URL object, which would disrupt the logic in the `gettype` function and lead to incorrect type determination.

DONE.
