  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `b` is equal to 1, which would result in the `return` statement being executed, returning a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 1. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to 1, which would result in the `return` statement being executed, returning a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result
