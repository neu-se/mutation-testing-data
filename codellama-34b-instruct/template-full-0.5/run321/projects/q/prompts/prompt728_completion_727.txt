  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, causing any code that depends on the promise to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved or rejected, causing any code that depends on the promise to continue executing but not necessarily in the intended way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.cancel
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be canceled instead of resolved or rejected, causing any code that depends on the promise to stop executing.

DONE.
