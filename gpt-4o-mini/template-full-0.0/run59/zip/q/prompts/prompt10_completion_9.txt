Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define.amd = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `define` object to indicate that AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is not supported, which could lead to the module not being defined correctly in environments that expect AMD support.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define = function() { return {}; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it redefines `define` as a function that always returns an empty object, preventing the actual module definition from being executed and thus breaking the intended functionality of the module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define("promise", definition);
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly names the module "promise" instead of using the default behavior of defining it without a name, which could lead to issues in module resolution if the module is expected to be named differently.

DONE.
