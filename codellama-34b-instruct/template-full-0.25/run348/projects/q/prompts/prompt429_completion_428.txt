  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function, and `object.inspect.rejected` is undefined, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.rejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.rejected` is a function, and `object.inspect.rejected()` would return a rejected promise, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.rejected.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.rejected` is a function, and `object.inspect.rejected.value` would return the value of the rejected promise, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`.
