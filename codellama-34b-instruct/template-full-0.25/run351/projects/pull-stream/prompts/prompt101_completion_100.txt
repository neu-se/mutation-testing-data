  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with `null` instead of `err` when `err` is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with `null` instead of `err` when `err` is `null`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === undefined ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with `null` instead of `err` when `err` is `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
