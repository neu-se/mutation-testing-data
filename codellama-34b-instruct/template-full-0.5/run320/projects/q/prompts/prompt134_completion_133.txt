  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable directly, while this modified code fragment is adding 1 to the `value` variable before using it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable directly, while this modified code fragment is multiplying the `value` variable by 2 before using it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable directly, while this modified code fragment is subtracting 1 from the `value` variable before using it.

DONE.
