  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the character 'a' to the content, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the content, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace('"', '\\"')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the double quotes in the content, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

DONE.
