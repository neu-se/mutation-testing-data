  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue !== null` is always true, whereas `isPromise(nearerValue)` checks if `nearerValue` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue !== undefined` is always true, whereas `isPromise(nearerValue)` checks if `nearerValue` is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue !== 0` is always true, whereas `isPromise(nearerValue)` checks if `nearerValue` is a promise.

DONE.
