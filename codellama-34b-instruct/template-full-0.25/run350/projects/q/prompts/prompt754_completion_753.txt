  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a rejected promise with the error "Cannot read property 'length' of null" instead of a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a rejected promise with the error "Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" instead of a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined` instead of a rejected promise with the error "Cannot read property 'length' of undefined".

DONE.
