  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return typeof value === "object" &&
        value !== null &&
        typeof value.then === "function";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a thenable object, while this code fragment checks if the value is an object and has the property "then" which is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value !== null &&
        typeof value.then === "function" &&
        typeof value.catch === "function";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a thenable object, while this code fragment checks if the value is an object and has both the properties "then" and "catch" which are functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value instanceof Object &&
        typeof value.then === "function";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a thenable object, while this code fragment
