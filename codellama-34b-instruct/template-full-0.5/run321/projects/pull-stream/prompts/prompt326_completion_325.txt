  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) once(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is not called with the correct argument. In the original code, `once` is called with `end` as an argument, but in this modified code, `once` is called with `null` as an argument. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) once(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with a different argument. In the original code, `once` is called with `end` as an argument, but in this modified code, `once` is called with `end` as an argument. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once`
