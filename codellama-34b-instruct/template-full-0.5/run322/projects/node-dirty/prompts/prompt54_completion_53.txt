  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `off` is a method that removes an event listener, while `once` is a method that adds a one-time event listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is a method that emits an event, while `once` is a method that adds a one-time event listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `on` is a method that adds an event listener, while `once` is a method that adds a one-time event listener.

DONE.
