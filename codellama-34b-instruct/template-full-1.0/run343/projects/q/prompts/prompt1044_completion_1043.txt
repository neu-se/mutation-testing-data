  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get` returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property, whereas `ends.promise.reject` returns a promise that rejects with the value of the `head` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get("head")` returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property, whereas `ends.promise.get("tail")` returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `tail` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(ends.promise.get("head"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property, whereas `ends.promise.get
