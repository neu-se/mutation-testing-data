  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method would be called with a delay of 0 milliseconds, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method would be called with a delay of -1 milliseconds, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method would be called with a delay of `null` milliseconds, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

DONE.
