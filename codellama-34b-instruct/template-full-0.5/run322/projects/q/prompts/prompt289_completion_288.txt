  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.reject, deferred.reject, deferred.notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called twice, which is not the intended behavior of the `resolver` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

DONE.
