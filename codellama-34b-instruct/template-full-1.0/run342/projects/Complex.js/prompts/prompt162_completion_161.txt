  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not a Number (NaN), while `isInfinity` checks if a value is infinite. Replacing `isInfinity` with `isNaN` would produce incorrect results in the `div` function, where the division by zero is checked using `isInfinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['getValue']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `getValue` is not a valid method for the `Complex` class. The `getValue` method is used in the `abs` function, which is called in other functions in the code snippet. Replacing `isInfinity` with `getValue` would cause a type error, indicating that the `Complex` class does not have a `getValue` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinity']()
```
This would result in different
