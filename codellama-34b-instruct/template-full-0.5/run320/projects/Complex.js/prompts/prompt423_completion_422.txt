  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero, while `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would result in the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is infinite, while `isInfinite` checks if the complex number as a whole is infinite.

DONE.
