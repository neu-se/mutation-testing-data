  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum stack counter instead of the minimum, which could cause the error to be thrown more frequently or less frequently, depending on the specific use case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the stack counter directly instead of the minimum or maximum, which could cause the error to be thrown at different points in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackTrace__"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the stack trace directly instead of the stack counter, which could cause the error to be thrown at different points in the code and with different error messages.

DONE.
