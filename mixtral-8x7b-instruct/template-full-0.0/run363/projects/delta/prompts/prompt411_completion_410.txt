 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the length instead of whether there is a next element, potentially skipping elements or causing an infinite loop if the length is always greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next() !== null
