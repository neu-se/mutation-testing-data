  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, decodedBasename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the basename to uppercase, which may not be what the code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.dirname(decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` would return the directory name of the basename, which may not be what the code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` would return the basename of the decodedBasename, which may not be what the code intended.

DONE.
