  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is checked for existence earlier in the function. By setting it to `null`, the `if (!options.url)` check would fail, and the function would not return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object with properties like `url` and `dest`, which are used throughout the function. By setting `options` to an empty object, all of the checks for the existence of these properties would fail, and the function would not return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url = 'https://example.com/invalid-url';
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would try to use the modified `options.url` as the URL for the request, which would likely fail.

DONE.
