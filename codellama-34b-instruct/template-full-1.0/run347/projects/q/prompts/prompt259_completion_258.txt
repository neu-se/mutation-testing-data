  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw an error rather than returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would reject the promise with the given value rather than resolving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + value
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to add 1 to the given value, which could result in an invalid promise resolution.

DONE.
