Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `callback` function would cause the `nfapply` method to fail, as it expects a valid function to invoke, leading to a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the `callback` function would also result in a runtime error when attempting to call `Q(undefined).nfapply(args)`, as `undefined` is not a callable function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of the `callback` function would lead to a type error when the code attempts to invoke `Q("string").nfapply(args)`, as a string cannot be called as a function.

DONE.
