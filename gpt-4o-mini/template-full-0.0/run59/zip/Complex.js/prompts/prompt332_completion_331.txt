Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is zero instead of one, which would change the condition under which the function returns `new Complex(0, Infinity)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is not equal to one, which would lead to the function returning `new Complex(0, Infinity)` for all values of `b` except one, altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `a` is equal to one instead of checking `b`, which would affect the logic and potentially lead to different results based on the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
