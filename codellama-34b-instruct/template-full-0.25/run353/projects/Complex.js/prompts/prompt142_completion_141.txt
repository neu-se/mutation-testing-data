  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero. This change would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when dividing by zero, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero. This change would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when dividing by zero, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z
