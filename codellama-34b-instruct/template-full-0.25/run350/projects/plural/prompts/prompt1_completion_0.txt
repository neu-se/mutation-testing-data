  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, but this new code fragment would extract a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substr(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, but this new code fragment would use the `substr` method to extract a different substring.
