  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property of the `data` object, rather than the `data` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key + '']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property of the `data` object, but with the `key` converted to a string first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key.toString()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property of the `data` object, but with the `key` converted to a string first using the `toString()` method.

DONE.
