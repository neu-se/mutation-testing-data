 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `.indexOf()` returns the index at which a specified string starts in a string, or -1 if it is not found. It does not check if the string is included as a substring anywhere in the string like `.includes()` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
