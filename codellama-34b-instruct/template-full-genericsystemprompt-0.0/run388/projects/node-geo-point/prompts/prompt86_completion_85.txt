  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance, while this replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude of the first point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the angular distance, while this replacement code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the latitude of the first point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance, while this replacement code fragment uses the `sin`
