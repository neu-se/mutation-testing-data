  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'error' to indicate an error has occurred, while 'resolve' is used to indicate that the task has been completed successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'error' to indicate an error has occurred, while 'reject' is used to indicate that the task has been completed with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'close' to indicate that the output stream has been closed, while 'reject' is used to indicate that the task has been completed with an error.

DONE.
