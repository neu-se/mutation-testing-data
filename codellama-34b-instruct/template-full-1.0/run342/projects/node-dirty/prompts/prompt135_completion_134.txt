  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key"
```
This would result in different behavior because "key" is a string literal, whereas `JSON.stringify` would stringify the object and produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"value"
```
This would result in different behavior because "value" is a string literal, whereas `JSON.stringify` would stringify the object and produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number, whereas `JSON.stringify` would stringify the object and produce a different output.

DONE.
