 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects the third argument to be a function, and `null` is not a function. This would likely cause an exception to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects the third argument to be a function that will be called with progress updates, but an empty function will not do anything when called. This would cause the progress updates to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects the third argument to be a function that will be called with progress updates, but `deferred.resolve` is a method that resolves the deferred object with a value. This would likely cause the progress updates to be replaced with a resolved value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
