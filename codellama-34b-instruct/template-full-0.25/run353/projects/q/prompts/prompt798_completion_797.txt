  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.notify()` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
