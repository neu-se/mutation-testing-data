  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses strict equality `===` to check if the callback returns a falsy value, while this option uses strict inequality `!==` to check if the callback returns a truthy value. If the callback function returns a value that is not `false` but also not `true`, this code would execute whereas the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === fn(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the value as the second argument to the callback function, while this option passes the key as the second argument. If the callback function expects the value to be passed as the second argument, this code would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key) && val === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the callback returns a falsy value and then compares the
