  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function that takes no arguments, but `done(end)` would call the function with the `end` argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function that takes no arguments, but `done(null)` would call the function with a null argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function that takes no arguments, but `done(1)` would call the function with the number 1 as an argument, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
