  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as the argument list, whereas the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as the argument list, whereas the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as the argument list,
