  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only splits the `src` string on commas if it is a glob pattern, whereas this modified code fragment always splits the `src` string on commas, regardless of whether it is a glob pattern or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {});
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any options to the `glob` method, whereas this modified code fragment passes an empty object as options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {
        nodir: true,
    });
});
```
This would
