  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the wrong arguments, potentially causing the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `null` instead of `data`, potentially causing the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `undefined` instead of `data`, potentially causing the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
