  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!loop` and `loop` have different truthy/falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!loop && true` is always truthy, while `!loop` is falsy when `loop` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `loop && false` is always falsy, while `!loop` is truthy when `loop` is falsy.

DONE.
