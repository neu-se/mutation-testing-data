  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `isNodeJS`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `isNodeJS` is `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression when the first operand is `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `isNodeJS`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression when the first operand is `true`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `isNodeJS`.

DONE.
