  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript keyword that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a method of the `Promise` object that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method of the `Promise` object that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `reject` is a method of the `Promise` object that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method of the `Q` object that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `reject` is a method of the `Promise` object that rejects the promise with a reason.

DONE.
