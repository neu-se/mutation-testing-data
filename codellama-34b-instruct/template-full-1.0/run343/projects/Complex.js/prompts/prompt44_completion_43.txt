  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are now compared for strict equality, whereas in the original code they are compared using the `!==` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are now compared using the loose == operator, whereas in the original code they are compared using the `!==` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are now compared using the `!=` operator, whereas in the original code they are compared using the `!==` operator.

DONE.
