  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[function(w) { return w.substring(1, 2) + 'ies' }];
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function is being passed to the `addRule` function, and `substring` is not the same as `substr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'is' }];
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function is being passed to the `addRule` function, and `substr` is not the same as `substring`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[function(w) { return w.substring(0, 1) + 'ies' }];
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function is being passed to the `addRule` function, and `substring` is not the same as `substr`.

DONE.
