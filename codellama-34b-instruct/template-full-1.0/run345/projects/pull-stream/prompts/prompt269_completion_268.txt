  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would signal the end of the stream, whereas `null` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would signal the end of the stream, whereas `!end` would signal that the stream has not ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would signal the end of the stream, whereas `undefined` would signal that the stream has ended but the end of the stream has not been reached.

DONE.
