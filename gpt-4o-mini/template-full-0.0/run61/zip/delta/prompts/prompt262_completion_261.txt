Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the attributes from `otherOp` instead of `thisOp`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute comparisons during the diff operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the attributes with `null`, which would cause the diff operation to ignore any attributes from `thisOp`, leading to incorrect diff results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to an empty object if `thisOp.attributes` is truthy, which would not accurately represent the original attributes and could lead to unexpected behavior in the diff operation.

DONE.
