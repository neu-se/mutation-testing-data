 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because now the 'isInfinite' method would return true if either the real or imaginary part of the complex number is NaN, instead of only returning true if both are finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because now the 'isInfinite' method would only check if the imaginary part is finite, instead of checking both the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because now the 'isInfinite' method would return false if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, instead of returning false only if the complex number is at the infinity pole.

DONE.
