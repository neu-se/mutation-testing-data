  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, which could cause the function to miss the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 instead of 0, which could cause the function to miss the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 0 instead of 1, which could cause the function to include the first element of the array.

DONE.
