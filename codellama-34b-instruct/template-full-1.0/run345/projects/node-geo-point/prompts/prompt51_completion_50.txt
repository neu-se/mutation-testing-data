  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude - point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction would be performed in the opposite direction, leading to a different calculated bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude - point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude values are subtracted instead of the longitude values, leading to a different calculated bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction is replaced with addition, leading to a different calculated bearing.

DONE.
