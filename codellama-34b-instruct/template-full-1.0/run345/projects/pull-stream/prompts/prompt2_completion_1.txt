  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(sources === null ? sinks : sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional check to always evaluate to `false`, causing the `exports` object to be populated with values from the `sinks` object instead of the `sources` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(sources.length === 0 ? sinks : sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `sources` object has a `length` property with a value of `0`, rather than checking if the `sources` object is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(sources.keys === 0 ? sinks : sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `sources` object has a property named `keys` with a value of `0`, rather than checking if the `sources` object is null or undefined.

DONE.
