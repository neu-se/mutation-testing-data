  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply assigns the `abortCb` function to the `abortCb` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `err` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply assigns the `abortCb` function to the `abortCb` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function without any arguments, which is not what the original code does. The original code assigns the `abortCb` function to
