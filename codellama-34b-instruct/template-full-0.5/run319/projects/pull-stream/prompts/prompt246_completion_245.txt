  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cb` is called with the error object as an argument, while in the mutated code, `cb` is called with `null` as an argument, which could cause the test to pass even if there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cb` is called with the error object as an argument, while in the mutated code, `cb` is called with `undefined` as an argument, which could cause the test to pass even if there is an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cb` is called with the error object as an argument, while in the mutated code, `cb` is called with an empty object as an argument, which could cause the test to pass even if there is an error.
