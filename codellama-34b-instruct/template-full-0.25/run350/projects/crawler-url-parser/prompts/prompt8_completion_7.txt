  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)) return null;

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while this new code fragment also checks if `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters. If `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters, the function would return `null`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)) return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while this new code fragment also checks if `baseUrlStr` does not contain illegal characters.
