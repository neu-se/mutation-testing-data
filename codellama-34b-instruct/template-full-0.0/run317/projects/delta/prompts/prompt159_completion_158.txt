  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current op is an insert, while this replacement checks if the next op is an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current op is a delete, while this replacement checks if the next op is a delete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current op has a non-zero length, while this replacement checks if the next op has a non-zero length.

DONE.
