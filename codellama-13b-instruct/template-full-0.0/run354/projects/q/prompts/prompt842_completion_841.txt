  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(ms, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message or Error object after the specified timeout, rather than simply timing out and throwing an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(ms)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value after the specified timeout, rather than simply timing out and throwing an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(ms)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a TimeoutError after the specified timeout, rather than simply timing out and throwing an exception.

DONE.
