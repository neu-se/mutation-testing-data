  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is a function, it would be called with the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits if the first operand is falsy, so if `cb` is a function, it would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits if the first operand is truthy, so if `cb` is a function, it would always be called.

DONE.
