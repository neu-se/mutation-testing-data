  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 res.resume(<newline>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the response data in chunks, whereas the original code consumes it all at once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the response data in chunks, whereas the original code consumes it all at once. Additionally, the original code has a conditional that checks the status code and rejects the promise if it's not 200, while the new code does not have this check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the response data in chunks, whereas the original code consumes it all at once. Additionally, the original code has a conditional that checks the status code and rejects the promise if it's not 200, while the new code does not have this check.
