  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `promises` is a non-empty array of promises, while `null` is a null reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `promises` is a non-empty array of promises, while `[]` is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `promises` is a non-empty array of promises, while `undefined` is a null reference.

DONE.
