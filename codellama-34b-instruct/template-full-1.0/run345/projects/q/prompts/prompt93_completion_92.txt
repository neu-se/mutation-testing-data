  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+4;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment check the length of the array, whereas this new code fragment would add 4 to the array length, leading to a different comparison result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
myArray.length();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length property, whereas this new code fragment would call the length method, leading to a different type of evaluation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for a truthy value, whereas this new code fragment would evaluate to false, leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
