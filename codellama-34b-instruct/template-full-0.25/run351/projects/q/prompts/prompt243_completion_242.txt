  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is initially undefined, but becomes an object once the promise is resolved. The `!` operator would return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is undefined, but `resolvedPromise === undefined` would return `false` even if `resolvedPromise` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and `typeof undefined` returns the string "undefined". This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently if `resolvedPromise` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the `if` statement would behave differently if `resolvedPromise` is `null
