  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return 2 instead of 1 as the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a random number instead of 1 as the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.floor(math.random()*100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a random number between 0 and 99 as the result of the function, instead of 1.

DONE.
