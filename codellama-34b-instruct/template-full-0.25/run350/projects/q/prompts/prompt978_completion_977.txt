  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function onto the `nodeArgs` array, which is used as an argument to the `this.dispatch()` method. However, the new code fragment does not push the function onto the array, which could cause the method to be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function onto the `nodeArgs` array, which is used as an argument to the `this.dispatch()` method. However, the new code fragment unshifts the function onto the array, which could cause the method to be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
