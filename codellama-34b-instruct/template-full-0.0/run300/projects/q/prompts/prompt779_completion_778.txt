  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message, which would be caught by the `onRejected` function and handled accordingly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise, which would be handled by the `onFulfilled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise, which would be handled by the `onFulfilled` function,
