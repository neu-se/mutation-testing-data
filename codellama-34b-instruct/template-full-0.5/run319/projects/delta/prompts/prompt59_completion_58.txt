  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the elements of the `ops` array starting from the second element, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
