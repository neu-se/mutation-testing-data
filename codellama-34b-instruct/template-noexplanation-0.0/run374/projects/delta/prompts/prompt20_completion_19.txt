  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This will cause the `diff` function to always return an empty object, as `a` and `b` are the same object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This will cause the `diff` function to always return an object with all properties set to `null`, as `null` is not equal to any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This will cause the `diff` function to always return an object with all properties set to `undefined`, as `undefined` is not equal to any value.

DONE.
