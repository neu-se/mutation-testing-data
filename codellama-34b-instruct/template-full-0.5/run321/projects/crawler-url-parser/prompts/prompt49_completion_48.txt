  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the URL using the parsed URL as the base URL, rather than the parsed base URL as the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the URL using the parsed URL as the base URL, rather than the base URL string as the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the URL using the parsed base URL as the base URL, rather than the parsed URL as the base URL.

DONE.
