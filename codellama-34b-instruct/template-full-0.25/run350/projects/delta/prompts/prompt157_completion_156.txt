  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this modified code fragment checks if it is not an insert. This would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this modified code fragment checks if it is a delete. This would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this modified code fragment checks if it is a retain. This would cause the code
