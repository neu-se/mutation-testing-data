 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<GeoPoint>[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method now expects an array of `GeoPoint` objects instead of a single `GeoPoint`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method now receives a `null` value instead of a `GeoPoint` object, causing a runtime error if the method is not adapted to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method now receives an object with `latitude` and `longitude` properties instead of a `GeoPoint` object. This would cause a runtime error if the method is not adapted to handle this case.

DONE.
