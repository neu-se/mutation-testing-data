  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first character of the stack line, which may not be the file name or line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the first character of the stack line, which may be part of the file name or line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the third part of the stack line, which may not be the file name or line number.

DONE.
