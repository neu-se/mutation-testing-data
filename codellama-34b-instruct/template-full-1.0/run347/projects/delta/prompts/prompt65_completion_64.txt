  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: [1, 2, 3] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is an array of numbers, while the original fragment is an object with a single property "insert".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: 4 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment has a different value for the "insert" property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: 5 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment has a different property "retain" instead of "insert".

DONE.
