  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `end`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ended` to `true` if `end` is `true` and `test(data)` is `true`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ended` to `true` if `end` is `true` or `test(data)` is `true`, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
