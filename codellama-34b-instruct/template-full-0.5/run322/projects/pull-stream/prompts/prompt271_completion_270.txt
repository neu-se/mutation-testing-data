  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the stream, whereas `values` is a function that returns an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(value => value.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.map()` returns a new stream with the values transformed by the provided function, whereas `values` returns an array of values without any transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(value => value > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.filter()` returns a new stream with the values that pass the provided predicate, whereas `values` returns an array of all values.

DONE.
