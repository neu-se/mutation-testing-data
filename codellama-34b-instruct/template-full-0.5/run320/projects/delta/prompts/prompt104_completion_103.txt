  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return the opposite of what the original code fragment would return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => predicate(op) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return only the operations that return `false` when passed to the `predicate` function, instead of returning all operations that return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => predicate(op) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return only the operations that do not return `true` when passed to the `predicate` function, instead of returning all operations that return `true`.

DONE.
