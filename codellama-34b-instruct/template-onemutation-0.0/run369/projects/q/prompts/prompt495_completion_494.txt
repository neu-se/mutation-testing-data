  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is a function that removes a promise from the list of unhandled rejections, whereas `trackRejection` is a function that adds a promise to the list of unhandled rejections. Using `untrackRejection` instead of `trackRejection` would cause the promise to be removed from the list of unhandled rejections, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
