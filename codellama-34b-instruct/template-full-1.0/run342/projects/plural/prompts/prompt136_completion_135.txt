  Sure, here are three possible options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) && num !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the ordering of the operands in the conditional expression, meaning that the test for the regular expression will always return true, and the plural function will always return the string 'es' regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] !== 'Function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the second element of the rule array is not a function, meaning that the original logic for determining whether to apply the rule would be reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of the original expression, meaning that the plural function would always return the original string regardless of whether the rule is applied.

DONE.
