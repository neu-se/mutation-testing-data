  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.push` adds an element to the end of the `args` array, whereas `args.unshift` adds an element to the beginning. This could potentially cause any function receiving the modified `args` array to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    return args;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment creates a new function and returns the `args` array, whereas the original code fragment directly returns the `args` array. This could potentially cause any function receiving the modified `args` array to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.splice(0, 1)` removes the first element of the `args` array, whereas `args.unshift` adds an element to the beginning. This
