  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exit()` method would be called on the `domain` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `enter()` method would be called on the `domain` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.foo()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo()` method does not exist on the `domain` object, and would likely cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
