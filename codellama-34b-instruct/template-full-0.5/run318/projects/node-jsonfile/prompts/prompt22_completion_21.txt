  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom(data.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a Buffer object, and calling `toString()` on a Buffer object returns a string representation of the buffer, but does not remove the BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the string. As a result, the `stripBom` function would not be able to remove the BOM from the string, and the resulting JSON object would be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `data` Buffer object, which could potentially remove the BOM from the string. However, it would also remove any other characters that come before the BOM, which could result in a different JSON object being parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0] = ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first character of the `data`
