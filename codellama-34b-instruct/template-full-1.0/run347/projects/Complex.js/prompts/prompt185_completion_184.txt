  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real part of `z` to `a`, which is not the same as taking the `a-th` power of `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the sine of the real part of `z`, which is not the same as taking the `a-th` power of `z`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the natural logarithm of the real part of `z`, which is not the same as taking the `a-th` power of `z`.

DONE.
