  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would create a rejected promise, causing the `dispatch` method to be called on a rejected promise, which would result in a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would create a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`, causing the `dispatch` method to be called on a resolved promise with a different value, which would result in a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q("foo")` would create a resolved promise with a value of `"foo"`, causing the `dispatch` method to be called on a resolved promise with a different value, which would result in a different execution path.

DONE.
