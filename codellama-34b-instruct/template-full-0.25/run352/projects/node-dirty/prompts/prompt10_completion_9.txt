  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path is truthy, while this modified code fragment checks if the path is truthy after converting it to lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path is truthy, while this modified code fragment checks if the length of the path is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path is truthy, while this modified code fragment checks if the last segment of the path is truthy after splitting it by '/'.

DONE.
