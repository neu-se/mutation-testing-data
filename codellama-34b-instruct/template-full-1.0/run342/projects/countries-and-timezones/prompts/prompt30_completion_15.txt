  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(Math.floor(offset / 60))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round the offset down to the nearest hour, and then apply the `getNumStr` function to the resulting number. In the original code, the offset was rounded to the nearest minute, not the nearest hour.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `getNumStr` function to the minutes component of the offset, but not the hours component. In the original code, the `getNumStr` function was applied to the entire offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `getNumStr` function to the offset divided by 60, which would result in a different number than the original code.

DONE.
