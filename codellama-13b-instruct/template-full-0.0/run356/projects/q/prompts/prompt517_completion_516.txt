  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called on the `deferred` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `reason` argument passed to the `reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called on the `deferred` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `reason` argument passed to the `resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called on the `deferred` object, which would cause the promise to be notified with the `reason` argument passed to the `notify` method.

DONE.
