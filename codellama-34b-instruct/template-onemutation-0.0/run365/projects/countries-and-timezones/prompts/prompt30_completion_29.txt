  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(Math.abs(min))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute value of `min`, regardless of whether it was negative or positive. In the original code, `getNumStr` was only called with negative values of `min`, so this change would cause the function to return a different value in those cases.
