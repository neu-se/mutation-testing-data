  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.length` would always be 1, regardless of the length of the `part` string, while `part` would be the actual string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.substring(1)` would return the substring of `part` starting from index 1, while `part` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `part[0]` would return the first character of `part`, while `part` would return the entire string.

DONE.
