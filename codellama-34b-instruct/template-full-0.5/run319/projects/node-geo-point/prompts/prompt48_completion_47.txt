  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses would cause the expression to be evaluated as a group, rather than as a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `φ2` is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `Math.PI` is a constant, and would cause the function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
