  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `thisp` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not an object, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `thisp` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not an object, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `thisp` variable.

DONE.
