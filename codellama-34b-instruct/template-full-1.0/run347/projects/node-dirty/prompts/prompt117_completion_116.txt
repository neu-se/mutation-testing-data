  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this.emit('error')```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event when the read stream is closed, while this code emits an error event unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this.emit('read_close', this._readStream)```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any arguments to the read_close event, while this code passes the read stream as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this.emit('read_close', null)```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the read stream as an argument to the read_close event, while this code passes null.

DONE.
