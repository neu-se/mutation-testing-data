Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` returns the primitive value of an object, which may not provide the same string representation as `toString`, leading to incorrect type checks or string outputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if an object has a property as its own (not inherited), which does not return a string representation of the object, thus failing to provide the expected output of `toString`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` returns a reference to the Object function that created the instance's prototype, which is not a string representation and would lead to unexpected results when used in the context of `isStopIteration`.

DONE.
