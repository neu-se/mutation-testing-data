  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and use the second argument instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of all arguments except the first one, instead of just the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the first argument, instead of just using the first argument as is.

DONE.
