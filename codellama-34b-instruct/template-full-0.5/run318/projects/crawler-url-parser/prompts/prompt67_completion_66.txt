  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` if the search query is not empty, rather than `false` if the search query is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"==="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` if the search query is not empty, rather than `false` if the search query is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<=="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` if the search query is not empty, rather than `false` if the search query is empty.

DONE.
