  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

DONE.
