  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the function from Q to the current object, which could break the code if it relies on the Q object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function return null instead of the Q object, which could break the code if it relies on the Q object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function return a new object instead of the Q object, which could break the code if it relies on the Q object.

DONE.
