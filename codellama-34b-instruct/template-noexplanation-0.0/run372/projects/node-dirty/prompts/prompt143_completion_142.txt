  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Buggy code fragment')
```
This will cause the `emit` function to emit an error event with a new error object, which will have a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This will cause the `emit` function to emit an error event with a null error object, which will have a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This will cause the `emit` function to emit an error event with an undefined error object, which will have a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
