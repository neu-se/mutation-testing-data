  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and `value` is a truthy value. This change would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `undefined` instead of the fulfilled value, which would result in a different behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `value` is a truthy value. This change would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `null` instead of the fulfilled value, which would result in a different behavior in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number". This change would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `NaN` instead of the fulfilled value, which would result in a different behavior in the
