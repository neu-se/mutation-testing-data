  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, as it simply returns the input word unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior than the original code fragment, as it would return `null` instead of the pluralized word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.sqrt(num)
```
This would result in different behavior than the original code fragment, as it would return the square root of the input number instead of the pluralized word.

DONE.
