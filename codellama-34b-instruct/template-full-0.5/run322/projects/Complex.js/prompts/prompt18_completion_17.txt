  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a number, which is different from the absolute value of a number returned by `Math.abs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, which is different from the absolute value of a number returned by `Math.abs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number, which is different from the absolute value of a number returned by `Math.abs`.

DONE.
