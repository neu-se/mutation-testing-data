  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["string", NaN]` instead of the expected `["filename", lineNumber]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["function", 42]` instead of the expected `["filename", lineNumber]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `[undefined, NaN]` instead of the expected `["filename", lineNumber]`.

DONE.
