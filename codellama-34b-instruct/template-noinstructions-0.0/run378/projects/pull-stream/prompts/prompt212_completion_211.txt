  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function reference, while `abortCb()` is a function call. The function call would execute the function immediately, which could cause unintended side effects and affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb.call()` is a function call with an empty argument list, which could cause the function to be executed with different arguments than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb.apply()` is a function call with an empty argument list, which could cause the function to be executed with different arguments than intended.

DONE.
