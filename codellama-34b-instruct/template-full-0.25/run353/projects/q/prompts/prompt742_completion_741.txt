  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.reject` would always reject the promise, regardless of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.resolve` would always resolve the promise, regardless of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.then` would always return a new promise, regardless of the promise's state.

DONE.
