  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `void 0` have different typeof values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` and `void 0` have different typeof values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `void(0)` and `void 0` have different semantic meanings.

DONE.
