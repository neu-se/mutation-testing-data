  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, causing the bearing calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are added together, causing the bearing calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are subtracted, causing the bearing calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
