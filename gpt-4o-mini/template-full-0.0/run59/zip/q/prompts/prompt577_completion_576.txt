Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the verb used in the `continuer` function, causing the generator to throw an exception instead of sending a value, which would alter the flow of execution and potentially lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to always expect a value to be sent, which could lead to incorrect handling of the generator's state and result in unexpected behavior if the generator is designed to throw exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"nextTick"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the control flow to use a different mechanism for continuing the generator, potentially leading to timing issues or race conditions in the execution of asynchronous code.

DONE.
