  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`captureLine()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `captureLine()` returns the line number where it is called, which is not the same as `arguments`, which is a list-like object containing the arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Q.all()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a promise that resolves when all the promises in the arguments have resolved. It is not equivalent to `arguments`, which is a list-like object containing the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`nodeback`
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function that is passed as an argument to the `nodeify` function, and it is not equivalent to `arguments`, which is a list-like object containing the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
