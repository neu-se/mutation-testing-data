Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 's' instead of 'es' to words that end with ch, x, or s, which is incorrect for pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the word before appending 'es', which would incorrectly pluralize words like "box" to "boxes" as "boxe".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly appends 'ies' to words that end with ch, x, or s, which is not the intended pluralization rule for those words.

DONE.
