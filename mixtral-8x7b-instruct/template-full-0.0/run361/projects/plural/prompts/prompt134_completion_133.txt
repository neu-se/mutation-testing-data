 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec
```
This would result in different behavior because `.exec()` returns the first match in an array, while `.test()` returns a boolean indicating whether or not there is a match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString().includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `.includes()` checks if the string is present in the object, while `.test()` checks if the string matches the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].source.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `.match()` returns an array of matches, while `.test()` returns a boolean indicating whether or not there is a match.

DONE.
