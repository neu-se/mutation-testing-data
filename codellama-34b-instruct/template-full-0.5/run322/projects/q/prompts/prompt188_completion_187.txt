  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the array, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the array, which may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the array, which may not exist.

DONE.
