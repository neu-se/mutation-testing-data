  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, causing the function to return the opposite of what it originally returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator is added, causing the function to return a different value than what it originally returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) && data.length > 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is added, causing the function to only return `true` if `data.length > 0`.

DONE.
