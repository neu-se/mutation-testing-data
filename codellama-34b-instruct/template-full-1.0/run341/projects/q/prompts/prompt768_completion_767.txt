  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `onRejected` function in the original code, while the replaced code would not have an effect on the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled, which would trigger the `onFulfilled` function in the original code, while the replaced code would not have an effect on the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled and then rejected, which would trigger the `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` functions in the original code, while the
