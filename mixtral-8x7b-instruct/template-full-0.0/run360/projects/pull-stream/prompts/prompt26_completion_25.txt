 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the current index `i` instead of the original function `pull`. This change would cause the arguments to be passed as individual elements rather than an array, breaking the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the `ref` array into a single argument list, instead of passing the array as a single argument. This change would break the intended functionality of passing the `ref` array as an argument to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pull.apply(null, ref.slice(0, 3))
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first three elements of the `ref` array to the `pull` function, ignoring the rest. This change would break the intended functionality of passing all elements of the `
