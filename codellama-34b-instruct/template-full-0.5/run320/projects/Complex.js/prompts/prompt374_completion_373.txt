  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * a` expression would always evaluate to `0`, regardless of the value of `a`. In contrast, the original code fragment `2 * b` would evaluate to `0` only if `b` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression would always evaluate to `0`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`. In contrast, the original code fragment `2 * b` would evaluate to `0` only if `b` is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * b` expression would always evaluate to `0`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`. In contrast, the original code fragment `2 * b` would evaluate to `0` only if `b` is
