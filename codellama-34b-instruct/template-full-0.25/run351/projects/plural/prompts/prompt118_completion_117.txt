  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics", while this new code fragment applies the rule to all words that end in "ics", regardless of whether they are singular or plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics", while this new code fragment applies the rule to all words that end in "ics", regardless of whether they are singular or plural, and also changes the ending from "ics" to "ices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices
