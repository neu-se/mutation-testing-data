  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would cause the queue to be closed with an error, whereas `closed.resolve` would close the queue normally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas `closed.resolve` would resolve the promise with the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` would create a new error object with a different message and stack trace than the original error object.

DONE.
