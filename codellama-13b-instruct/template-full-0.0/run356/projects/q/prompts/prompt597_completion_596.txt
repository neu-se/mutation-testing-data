  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call on the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment is a method call on the `object` variable. This could result in different behavior if the `Q` object and the `object` variable have different implementations of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call on the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment is a static method call on the `Q` object. This could result in different behavior if the `Q` object has different implementations of the `dispatch` method depending on whether it is called as a method or as a static method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call on the `Q` object, while the bug
