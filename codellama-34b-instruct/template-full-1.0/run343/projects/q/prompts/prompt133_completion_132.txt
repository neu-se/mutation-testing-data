  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function relies on the `Object` prototype to determine whether a value is an object. Replacing it with `String` would cause the function to always return `false` for string values, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function relies on the `Object` prototype to determine whether a value is an object. Replacing it with `Boolean` would cause the function to always return `true` for boolean values, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function relies on the `Object` prototype to determine whether a value is an object. Replacing it with `Number` would cause the function to always return `true` for numeric values, which is not the intended behavior.
