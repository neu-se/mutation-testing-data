  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but this replacement code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `undefined`, but this replacement code fragment returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "Hello, world!";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `undefined`, but this replacement code fragment returns a string.

DONE.
