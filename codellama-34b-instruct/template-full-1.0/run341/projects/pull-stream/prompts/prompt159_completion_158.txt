  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the `_value` variable, but this new code fragment returns the result of adding 1 to `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the `_value` variable, but this new code fragment returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the `_value` variable, but this new code fragment returns `undefined`.

DONE.
