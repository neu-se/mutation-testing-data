  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred promise with the value returned by the callback, while this code fragment resolves the deferred promise with the value itself, which could be a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the deferred promise with the error returned by the callback, while this code fragment rejects the deferred promise with the error itself, which could be a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment notifies the deferred promise with the value returned by the callback, while this code fragment notifies the deferred promise with the value itself, which could be a promise.

DONE.
