  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
VariableName
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a different variable than the original code fragment, which was `flush`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the `flush` variable, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `flush` variable to a string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
