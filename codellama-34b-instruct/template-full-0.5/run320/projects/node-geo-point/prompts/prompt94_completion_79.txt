  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(φ2)` calculates the sine of `φ2`, which is not the same as `asin(φ2)`, which calculates the arcsine of `φ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(φ2)` calculates the cosine of `φ2`, which is not the same as `asin(φ2)`, which calculates the arcsine of `φ2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(φ2)` calculates the tangent of `φ2`, which is not the same as `asin(φ2)`, which calculates the arcsine of `φ2`.

DONE.
