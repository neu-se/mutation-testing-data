  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different set of arguments to the `apply` method, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different set of arguments to the `apply` method, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `apply` method, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
