  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` will resolve the promise with the error object, whereas `deferred.reject` will reject the promise with the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause an error to be thrown when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function will not reject the promise with the error object, but will instead resolve the promise with `undefined`.

DONE.
