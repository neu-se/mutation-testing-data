  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfapply` function is used to call the `FS.readFile` function with the `__filename` argument, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Q` function to call the `FS.readFile` function with the `__filename` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(FS.readFile, __filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfcall` function is used to call the `FS.readFile` function with the `__filename` argument, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Q` function to call the `FS.readFile` function with the `__filename` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(FS.readFile, __filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind`
