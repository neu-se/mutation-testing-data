  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected, onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled, onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onFulfilled` function to be called with the wrong argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
