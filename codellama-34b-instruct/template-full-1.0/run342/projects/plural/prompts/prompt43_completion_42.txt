  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in a difference because the plural form of 'appendix' would be 'appendices' instead of 'appendixes', which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in a difference because the plural form of 'appendix' would be 'appendixii' instead of 'appendixes', which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - String(w).length
```
This would result in a difference because the plural form of 'appendix' would be 'appendix' instead of 'appendixes', which is incorrect.

DONE.
