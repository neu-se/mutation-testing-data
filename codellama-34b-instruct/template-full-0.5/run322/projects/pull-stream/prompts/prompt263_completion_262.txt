  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `data` array to the `cb` function, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first element of the `data` array to the `cb` function, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data.filter(function(d) { return d !== null; }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the non-null elements of the `data` array to the `cb` function, instead of passing the entire array.

DONE.
