  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then()` is a method that returns a promise, and using it in place of `value` would result in the promise being resolved with a new value instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `value + 1` is a different value than `value`, and would cause the `then()` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `value * 2` is a different value than `value`, and would cause the `then()` method to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
