  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `1 + 1` always evaluates to 2, whereas the original expression `otherOp.retain` could be any number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `undefined` always evaluates to `undefined`, whereas the original expression `otherOp.retain` could be any number or a different type of value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `null` always evaluates to `null`, whereas the original expression `otherOp.retain` could be any number or a different type of value.

DONE.
