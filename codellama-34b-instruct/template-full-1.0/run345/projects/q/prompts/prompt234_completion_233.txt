  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.anotherProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access a property that does not exist on the promise object, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the promise dispatch function, which would not be a valid argument.

DONE.
