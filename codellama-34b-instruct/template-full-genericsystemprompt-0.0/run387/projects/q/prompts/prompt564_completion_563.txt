  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript keyword that can be used to throw an exception, whereas `reject` is a method of the `Promise` object that is used to reject a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a JavaScript keyword that can be used to return a value from a function, whereas `reject` is a method of the `Promise` object that is used to reject a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method of the `Q` object that is used to reject a promise, whereas `reject` is a method of the `Promise` object that is used to reject a promise.

DONE.
