  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is a method that returns an object with information about the promise's state, but it does not affect the promise's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a variable that refers to the promise object, but it does not affect the promise's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, but it does not affect the promise's behavior.

DONE.
