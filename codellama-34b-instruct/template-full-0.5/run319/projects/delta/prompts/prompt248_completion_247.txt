  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisIter.peekLength` to get the length of the current operation, but subtracting 1 would result in a different value being used, potentially causing the algorithm to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisIter.peekLength` to get the length of the current operation, but adding 1 would result in a different value being used, potentially causing the algorithm to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisIter.peekLength` to get the length of the current operation, but multiplying by 2 would result in a different value being used, potentially causing the algorithm to behave differently.

DONE.
