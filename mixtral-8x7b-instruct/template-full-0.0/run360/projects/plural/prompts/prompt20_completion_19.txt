 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|ss$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression `/ss$/i` will incorrectly match words ending in 'ss' and append an extra 'e' when pluralizing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now always appends 'ies' to the end of the word, regardless of the actual pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + (w.endsWith('e') ? '' : 'e') + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now checks if the word ends with 'e'
