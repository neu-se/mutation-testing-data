  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer.bind, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the inner `bind` would return a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function, rather than the `continuer` function itself. This would cause the `errback` function to be called with the wrong context, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function, but with a `null` context. This would cause the `errback` function to be called with the wrong context, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(function () {}, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function that is bound to an anonymous
