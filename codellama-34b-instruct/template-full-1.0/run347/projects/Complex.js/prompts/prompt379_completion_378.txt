  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(this['im'] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` would be called with a different argument, which could cause the returned value to be different from the original calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant, and multiplying it by `this['im']` could cause the returned value to be different from the original calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(this['im']) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be one more than the original calculation.

DONE.
