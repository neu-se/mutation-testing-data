  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This code fragment emits the `drain` event with the number of in-flight writes as the argument, which is different from the original code fragment that emits the `drain` event without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This code fragment emits the `drain` event with the size of the queue as the argument, which is different from the original code fragment that emits the `drain` event without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites + this._queue.size);
```
This code fragment emits the `drain` event with the sum of the number of in-flight writes and the size of the queue as the argument, which is different from the original code fragment that emits
