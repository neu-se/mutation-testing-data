  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString()` would return the string representation of the `content` object, while `content.toString` would return the `toString` method of the `content` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the string representation of the `content` object, while `content.toString()` would return the string representation of the `content` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.substring(1)` would return the substring of the string representation of the `content` object starting from the second character, while `content.toString()` would return the string representation of the `content` object.

DONE.
