  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    return callback.fcall().then(function () {
        return value;
    });
}, function (reason) {
    // TODO attempt to recycle the rejection with "this".
    return callback.fcall().then(function () {
        throw reason;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on `this` instead of `callback`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

    // TODO attempt to recycle the rejection with "this".
    return callback.fcall().then(function () {
        return reason;
    });
