  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if the promise has been resolved, whereas `messages` would be falsy if the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` would always be falsy if the promise has not been resolved, whereas `messages` would be truthy if the promise has not been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect().state` would always be "pending" if the promise has not been resolved, whereas `messages` would be truthy if the promise has not been resolved.

DONE.
