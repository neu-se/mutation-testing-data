  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, { cwd: path.dirname(targetFilePath) });
```
This would result in different behavior because `glob()` would search for files in the directory of the target file, which differs from the original behavior of searching in the current working directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, { ignore: [ targetFilePath ] });
```
This would result in different behavior because the target file would be excluded from the search results, which differs from the original behavior of including it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, { dot: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because `glob()` would include hidden files and directories, which differs from the original behavior of excluding them.

DONE.
