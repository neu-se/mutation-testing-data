  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
