  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `then` method to call the `rejected` callback instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved, which would cause the `then` method to call the `progressed` callback instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a `null` value instead of the original value, which could cause the `then` method to call the `fulfilled` callback with a different argument.

DONE.
