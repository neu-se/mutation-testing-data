  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that is called with the `aborted` argument, but it is not defined in the original code. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would indicate that the test suite is not effective in catching errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with the `data` argument, which is not the expected behavior. This would cause the test suite to fail, which would indicate that the tests are not effective in catching errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with the `err` argument, which is not the expected behavior. This would cause the test suite to fail, which
