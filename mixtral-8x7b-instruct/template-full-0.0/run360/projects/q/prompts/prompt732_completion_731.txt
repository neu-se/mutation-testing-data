 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(promises);` line would not be executed if there are any pending promises, even if all other promises have been fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(promises);` would never be called, and the promise would never be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if there are no promises in the input array, the promise would be immediately resolved instead of waiting for all input promises to settle.

DONE.
