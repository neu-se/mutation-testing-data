  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the replacement code fragment uses the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the replacement code fragment uses the identity function, which returns the value of `x` unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the replacement code fragment uses the addition operator, which adds 1 to the value of `x`.

DONE.
