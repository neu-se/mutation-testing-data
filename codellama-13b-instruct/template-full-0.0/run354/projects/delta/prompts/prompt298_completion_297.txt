  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is called with the `attributes` property of the `Op` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).insert || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is called with the `insert` property of the `Op` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).retain || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function is called with the `retain` property of the `Op` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
