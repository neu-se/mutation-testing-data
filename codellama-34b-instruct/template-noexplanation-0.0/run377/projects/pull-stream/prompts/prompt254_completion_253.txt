  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream()
```
This change will cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if the `err` variable is not equal to `true`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === false) nextStream()
```
This change will cause the `nextStream()` function to be called only if the `err` variable is equal to `false`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) nextStream()
```
This change will cause the `nextStream()` function to be called only if the `err` variable is not equal to `null` or `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
