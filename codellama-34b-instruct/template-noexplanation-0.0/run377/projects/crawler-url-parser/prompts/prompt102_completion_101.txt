  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This change will cause the `urlMap.set()` method to use the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object as the key for the map, rather than the `url` property. This could potentially cause the `urlMap` to contain different keys than the original code, which could affect the behavior of the `extract()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This change will cause the `urlMap.set()` method to use the `protocol` property of the `currentUrl` object as the key for the map, rather than the `url` property. This could potentially cause the `urlMap` to contain different keys than the original code, which could affect the behavior of the `extract()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This change will cause the `urlMap.set()` method to use the `host` property of the `currentUrl` object
