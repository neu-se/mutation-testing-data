  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra newline character to the stack trace, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a space character to the stack trace, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"|"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a vertical bar character to the stack trace, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

DONE.
