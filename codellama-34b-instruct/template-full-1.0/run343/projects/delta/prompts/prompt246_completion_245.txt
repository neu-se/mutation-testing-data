  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.Insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.Insert` would insert a delta instead of deleting it, leading to unexpected results when the `diff` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.push(thisOp)` would add the current operation to the delta instead of deleting it, leading to unexpected results when the `diff` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete(thisOp)` would delete all instances of the current operation from the delta, leading to unexpected results when the `diff` method is called.

DONE.
