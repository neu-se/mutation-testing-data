  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is not defined in the provided code, while `StopIteration` is a built-in JavaScript exception. Using `instanceof` instead would cause the code to behave differently if `StopIteration` is not defined.

DONE.
