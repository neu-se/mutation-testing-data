  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with the value returned by `this.get(key)`, which may not be the same as the value stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this._data.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with the value stored in the `_data` map, which may not be the same as the value stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this._data.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with the value stored in the `_data` map, which may not be the same as the value stored in the database.
