  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method would return `undefined` instead of the promise, which would cause the promise chain to break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method would return `null` instead of the promise, which would cause the promise chain to break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method would return the string `"test"` instead of the promise, which would cause the promise chain to break.

DONE.
