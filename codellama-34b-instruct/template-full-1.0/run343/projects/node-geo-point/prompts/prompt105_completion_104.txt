  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor((coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` would round the result down to the nearest integer, whereas the original code does not round the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil((coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` would round the result up to the nearest integer, whereas the original code does not round the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round((coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round()` would round the result to the nearest integer, whereas the original code does not round the result.
