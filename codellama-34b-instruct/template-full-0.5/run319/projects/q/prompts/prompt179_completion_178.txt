  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.contains
```
This would result in different behavior because `contains` is not a method of the `String` object in JavaScript, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method of the `String` object in JavaScript, but it would not provide the same functionality as `indexOf` in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method of the `String` object in JavaScript, but it would not provide the same functionality as `indexOf` in this context.

DONE.
