  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `keepNull` is `false`, which would cause the `reduce` method to return an empty object instead of an object with the desired properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull && attributes[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` when `keepNull` is `false` and `attributes[key]` is not `null`, which would cause the `reduce` method to return an object with the desired properties only when `keepNull` is `false` and `attributes[key]` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `attributes[key]` is not `null`, which would cause the `reduce` method to return an object with the desired properties only when `attributes[key]`
