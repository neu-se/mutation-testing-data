  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'read_close'` event without any arguments, while the modified code emits the event with the `_readStream` object as an argument. This could potentially cause issues with any code that is listening for the `'read_close'` event and expects a different set of arguments.

DONE.
