 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attempt1 && attempt1.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `attempt1` is not falsy and has a length greater than 1, instead of just checking if `attempt1` is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)[0] === 'attempt1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first element of the result of `getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)` is equal to 'attempt1' instead of checking if it is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attempt1 || []
