  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an empty array instead of an array containing the keys of the `value` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an array containing the keys of the `value` object, but the `keys` property of the returned promise would be `undefined` instead of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an empty array instead of an array containing the keys of the `value` object, and the `keys` property of the returned promise would be an empty array instead of `undefined`.

DONE.
