  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the base URL as the second argument to the `Map.set()` method, which would cause the base URL to be associated with the current URL in the map, rather than the original URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the protocol as the second argument to the `Map.set()` method, which would cause the protocol to be associated with the current URL in the map, rather than the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the host as the second argument to the `Map.set()` method, which would cause the host to be associated with the current URL in the map, rather than the original URL.

DONE.
