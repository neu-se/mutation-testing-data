  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var definition = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var definition = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function is defined but does not have a return statement.

DONE.
