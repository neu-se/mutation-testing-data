  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1 !== b` will always evaluate to `true` for any non-zero value of `b`, but the replaced code fragment `b !== 1` will evaluate to `false` for any non-zero value of `b`, causing the `if` statement to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(1 === b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1 !== b` will always evaluate to `true` for any non-zero value of `b`, but the replaced code fragment `!(1 === b)` will evaluate to `false` for any non-zero value of `b`, causing the `if` statement to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1 !== b` will always evaluate to `true` for any non-
