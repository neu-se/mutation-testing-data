  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `glob` method to be called multiple times, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.directory(globPart, false);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `directory` method to be called multiple times, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.file(globPart, { name: globPart });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `file` method to be called multiple times, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
