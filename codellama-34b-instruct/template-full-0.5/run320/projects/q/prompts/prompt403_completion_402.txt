  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function (value) { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the return value of the given function, whereas `thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.
