  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return -1, indicating that the substring is not found in the string, rather than the actual index of the substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return 0, indicating that the substring is found at the beginning of the string, rather than the actual index of the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return the index of the last occurrence of the substring in the string, rather than the actual index of the substring.

DONE.
