  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (opt ? '^/$|^' : '^') + parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is called on `parts` with the initial value of `acc` set to an empty string, which means that the resulting regex will always start with a `/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (opt ? '^/$|^' : '^') + parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is called on `parts` with the initial value of `acc` set to an empty string, which means that the resulting regex will never start with a `/`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (opt ? '^/$|^' : '^') + parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior
