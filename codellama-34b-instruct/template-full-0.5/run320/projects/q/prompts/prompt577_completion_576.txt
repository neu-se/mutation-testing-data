  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" verb to indicate that the generator should continue iterating, while the new code fragment uses the "throw" verb to indicate that an error should be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" verb to indicate that the generator should continue iterating, while the new code fragment uses the "yield" verb to indicate that the generator should yield a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" verb to indicate that the generator should continue iterating, while the new code fragment uses the "return" verb to indicate that the generator should return a value.

DONE.
