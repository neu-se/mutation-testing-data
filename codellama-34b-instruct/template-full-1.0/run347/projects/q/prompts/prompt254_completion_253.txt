  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire message to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, whereas this code fragment passes the length of the message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire message to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, whereas this code fragment passes the first element of the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire message to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, whereas this code fragment passes undefined.

DONE.
