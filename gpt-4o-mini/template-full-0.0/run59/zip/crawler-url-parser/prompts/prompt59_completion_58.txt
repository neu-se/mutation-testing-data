Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parsing behavior of the URL, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect or malformed URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL parsing to fail, leading to a return value of `null` for the `ret` object instead of a properly formatted URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string that is not a boolean or a valid option for the `URL.parse` function would likely throw an error or produce unexpected results, disrupting the normal flow of the function.
