Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using `sin` instead of `cos` would change the calculation of the `y` component in the bearing calculation, leading to incorrect bearing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using `tan` instead of `cos` would alter the trigonometric relationship in the calculation, potentially resulting in an incorrect angle for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cos` with a constant value of `1` would ignore the actual cosine of the angle, leading to incorrect calculations for the bearing, as it would not account for the latitude's effect on the bearing.

DONE.
