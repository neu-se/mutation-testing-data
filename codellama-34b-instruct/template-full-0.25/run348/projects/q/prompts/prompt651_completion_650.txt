  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid method for the "dispatch" function, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a valid method for the "dispatch" function, but it would not have the same effect as "post" because it would not update the value of the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a valid method for the "dispatch" function, but it would not have the same effect as "post" because it would not update the value of the property.

DONE.
