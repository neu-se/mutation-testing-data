  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected(new Error("error"))` would return a rejected promise with a specific error message, whereas `rejected` on its own would return a rejected promise with no error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected(null)` would return a rejected promise with a `null` error message, whereas `rejected` on its own would return a rejected promise with no error message.

DONE.
