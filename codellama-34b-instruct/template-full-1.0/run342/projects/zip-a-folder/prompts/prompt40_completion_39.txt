  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` is a different method than `split`, and it would change the way the input string is processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of a string, and it would change the way the input string is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.trim
```
This would result in different behavior because `trim` is a method of a string, and it would change the way the input string is processed.

DONE.
