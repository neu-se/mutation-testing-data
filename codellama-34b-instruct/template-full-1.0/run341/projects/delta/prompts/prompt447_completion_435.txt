  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the `ops` array instead of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous element in the `ops` array instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at index `this.index + 2` instead of the current element.

DONE.
