Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

function id (e) { return e }
var prop = require('../util/prop')
var filter = require('./filter')

//drop items you have already seen.
module.exports = function unique (field, invert) {
  field = <PLACEHOLDER>(field) || id
  var seen = {}
  return filter(function (data) {
    var key = field(data)
    if(seen[key]) return !!invert //false, by default
    else seen[key] = true
    return !invert //true by default
  })
}


```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
prop
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
