  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to reject instead of resolve, potentially causing the calling code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<any other deferred method than resolve/reject>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to be rejected, potentially causing the calling code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` method to notify the progress of the promise instead of resolving or rejecting it, potentially causing the calling code to behave differently.

DONE.
