  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retain the entire length of the other op, rather than only retaining the length of the first other op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retain the entire length of the this op, rather than only retaining the length of the first this op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = Math.min(thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only retain the minimum length of the two ops, rather than the entire length of the first op.

DONE.
