  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because "a == null" checks if "a" is null or undefined, while "typeof a !== 'object'" only checks if "a" is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because "a !== null" checks if "a" is not null, while "typeof a !== 'object'" only checks if "a" is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because "a === undefined" checks if "a" is undefined, while "typeof a !== 'object'" only checks if "a" is not an object.

DONE.
