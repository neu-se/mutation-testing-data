 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the argument (angle) of the complex number, while this change would result in the reciprocal of the imaginary part, which is not the same as the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the argument (angle) of the complex number, while this change would use the real part instead, which is not the same as the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(this['re'], this['im']) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the argument (angle) of the complex number, while this change would double the angle, which would give an incorrect result.

DONE.
