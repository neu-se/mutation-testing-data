  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return immediately without calling `nextStream`, which is necessary to move on to the next stream in the stream of streams.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `_read` to `null` instead of calling `nextStream`, which would cause the function to return immediately without processing any more data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `_read` to a no-op function instead of calling `nextStream`, which would cause the function to return immediately without processing any more data.

DONE.
