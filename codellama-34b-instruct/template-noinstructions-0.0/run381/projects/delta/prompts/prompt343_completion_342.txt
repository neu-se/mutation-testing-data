  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with the `embedType` argument, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType, otherData[embedType])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with the `embedType` and `otherData[embedType]` arguments, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType, otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` function to be called with the `embedType`, `otherData[embedType]`, and `priority` arguments, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
