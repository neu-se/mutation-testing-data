  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is no longer used as the number of spaces to indent the JSON string. Instead, it is incremented by 1, which could cause the indentation to be off by one space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is no longer used as the number of spaces to indent the JSON string. Instead, it is multiplied by 2, which could cause the indentation to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is no longer used as the number of spaces to indent the JSON string. Instead, it is replaced with 0, which could cause the JSON string to be printed on a single line without any indentation.

DONE.
