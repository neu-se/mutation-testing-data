  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be longer, potentially causing the task to be executed later than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be shorter, potentially causing the task to be executed earlier than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 100)
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be shorter, potentially causing the task to be executed earlier than intended.

DONE.
