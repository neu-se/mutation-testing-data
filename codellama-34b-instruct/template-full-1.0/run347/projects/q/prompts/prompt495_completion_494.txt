  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection("foo", reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackRejection` is called with a string argument instead of a promise, which would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` would be called instead of `trackRejection`, which would cause the unhandled rejection to be removed from the list of tracked rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(...arguments, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackRejection` would be called with the spread operator, which would cause the function to be called with each argument individually, instead of as an array.

DONE.
