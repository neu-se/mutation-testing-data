  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` returns a different substring than `w.substr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` returns a different substring than `w.substr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice(0, -2)` returns a different substring than `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)`.

DONE.
