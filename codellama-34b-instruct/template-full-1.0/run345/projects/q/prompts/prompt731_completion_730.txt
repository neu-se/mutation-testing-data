  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index + 1, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be one higher than the original, which could cause the test to fail if it relies on the correct index value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: undefined, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be undefined, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior if the test relies on the index value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ value: progress + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be one higher than the original, which could cause the test to fail if it relies on the correct value.

DONE.
