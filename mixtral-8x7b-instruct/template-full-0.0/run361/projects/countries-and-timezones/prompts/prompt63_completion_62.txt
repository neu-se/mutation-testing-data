 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would not receive the `data` and `id` as arguments, and instead an empty object would be passed. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the `buildCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['someId']
