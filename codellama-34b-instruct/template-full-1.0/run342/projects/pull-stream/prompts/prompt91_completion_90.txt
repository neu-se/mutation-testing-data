  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `test` function, which would cause it to return `false` even if the input data is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` function would be called with no arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` function would be called with the `data` as an argument, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the input data is invalid.

DONE.
