  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array containing all elements from the original `arguments` array except the first one, whereas `arguments` would return the original `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array containing all elements from the original `arguments` array except the first two, whereas `arguments` would return the original `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array containing all elements from the original `arguments` array except the first three, whereas `arguments` would return the original `arguments` array.

DONE.
