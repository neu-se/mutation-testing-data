  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all the elements of `promises` except the first one, whereas the original code fragment returns the original `promises` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all the elements of `promises` followed by an empty array, whereas the original code fragment returns the original `promises` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all the elements of `promises` that pass the filter function, whereas the original code fragment returns the original `promises` array.

DONE.
