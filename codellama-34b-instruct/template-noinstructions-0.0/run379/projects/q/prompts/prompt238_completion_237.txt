  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a promise, and it would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a promise, and it would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
