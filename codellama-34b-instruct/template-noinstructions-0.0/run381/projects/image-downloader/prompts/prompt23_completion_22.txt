  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `__dirname` to get the absolute path of the current directory, while the new code would use the current working directory instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
".."
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `__dirname` to get the absolute path of the current directory, while the new code would use the parent directory instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `__dirname` to get the absolute path of the current directory, while the new code would use the root directory instead.

DONE.
