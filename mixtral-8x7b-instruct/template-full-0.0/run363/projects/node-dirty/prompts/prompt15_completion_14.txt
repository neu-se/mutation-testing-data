 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked immediately, while the original code fragment invokes the callback when the data is persisted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb.bind(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a single argument `null`, while the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be scheduled to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, while the original code fragment invokes the callback synchronously.

DONE.
