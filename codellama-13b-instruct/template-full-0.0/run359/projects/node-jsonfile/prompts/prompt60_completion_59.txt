  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer()` method returns `true` if the given argument is a `Buffer` object, while the original code fragment returns `true` if the given argument is a `Buffer` object or a string that contains a `Buffer` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `content.toString('utf8')` method returns a string representation of the `content` object, while the original code fragment returns the `content` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')` method removes the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) from the beginning of the `content` string, while the original code fragment does not modify the `content` string.
