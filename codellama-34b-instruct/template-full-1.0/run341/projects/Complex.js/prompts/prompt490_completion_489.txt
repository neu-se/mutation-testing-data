Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property to `false`, which could affect how the module is treated by other code that relies on this property.

```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true, 'otherProperty': 123 }

This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional property `otherProperty` to the `Complex` object, which could affect how the object is handled by other code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true, 'otherProperty': Complex.ZERO }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional property `otherProperty` to the `Complex` object, and initialize it with the value `Complex.ZERO`, which could affect how
