  DONE.

let linkurl_parts = linkurl_path.split("some_text").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
            return elem.length > 0
        });
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regex that matches a forward slash, which is a special character in strings that need to be escaped in regular expressions. This change would cause the splitting to not work correctly, and the code would go into infinite recursion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split().filter(function (elem, index, array) {
            return elem.length > 0
        });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the destructuring assignment syntax to create a new array with the same elements as the original array, which would be lost in this change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(" ").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
            return elem.length > 0
        });
```
This would
