  Here are three potential solutions:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise instead of fulfilling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise instead of using the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makeDeferred().makePromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise using a new deferred instead of using the existing one.

DONE.
