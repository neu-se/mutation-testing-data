resolvedPromise.isResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.isResolved` is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the promise has been resolved or not, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a promise object that may or may not have been resolved.

```
resolvedPromise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.state` is a property that contains the state of the promise (e.g. "pending", "fulfilled", or "rejected"), whereas `resolvedPromise` is a promise object that may or may not have
