  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, [name, nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array. In this case, it would call the `dispatch` method with `this` set to the `Promise` object and the arguments `name` and `nodeArgs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this, name, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. In this case, it would call the `dispatch` method with `this` set to the `Promise` object and the arguments `name` and `nodeArgs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this, name, nodeArgs)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is
