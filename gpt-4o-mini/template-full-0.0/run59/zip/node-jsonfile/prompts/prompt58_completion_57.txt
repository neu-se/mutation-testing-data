Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces newline characters with a space instead of the specified EOL, altering the formatting of the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces newline characters with a tab character, which changes the structure of the output string significantly compared to using the original EOL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' after each newline, which modifies the output by adding unexpected content to the string.

DONE.
