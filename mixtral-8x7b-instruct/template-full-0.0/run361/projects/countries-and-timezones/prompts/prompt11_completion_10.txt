 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...result, [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of modifying the existing one, which may cause unexpected issues if other parts of the code rely on mutating the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns a new object to the `result[country]` property, bypassing any custom logic that might be implemented in the `Object.assign` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `result` object and then assigns a new object to the `country` property, which may cause unexpected issues if other parts of the code rely on mut
