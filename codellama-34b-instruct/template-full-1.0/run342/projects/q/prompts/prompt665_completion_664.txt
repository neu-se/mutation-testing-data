  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + 1` is a constant expression that always evaluates to `2`, regardless of the input argument, and would cause the `Q.invoke` function to always return a resolved promise with value `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not defined and would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(x => x)` is a function that always returns its argument unmodified, regardless of the input argument, and would cause the `Q.invoke` function to always return a resolved promise with the original input argument.

DONE.
