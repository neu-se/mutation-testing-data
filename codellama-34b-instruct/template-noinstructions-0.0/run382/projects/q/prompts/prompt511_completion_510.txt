  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` and `args` variables are not defined in the scope of the `async` function, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the `thisp` argument to the `value.apply()` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `thisp` argument to the `value.apply()` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
