 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line.indexOf('node') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude any stack lines containing the string 'node' (not just Node.js frames), potentially hiding important stack trace information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isNodeFrame(line) && line
