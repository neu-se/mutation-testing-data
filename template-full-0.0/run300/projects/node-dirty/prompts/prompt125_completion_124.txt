  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a dummy error message, which would cause the test suite to fail if it is not properly handling error events.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'dummy data');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a data event with dummy data, which would cause the test suite to fail if it is not properly handling data events.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', {dummy: 'data'});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a data event with a dummy object, which would cause the test suite to fail if it is not properly handling data events.

DONE.
