 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.timezones[tzName]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `timezones` object using the `tzName` as the key, bypassing the `getTimezone` function. This could lead to unexpected results if the `tzName` is not a valid key or if the `timezones` object has been modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getTimezone(tzName) || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object when `getTimezone(
