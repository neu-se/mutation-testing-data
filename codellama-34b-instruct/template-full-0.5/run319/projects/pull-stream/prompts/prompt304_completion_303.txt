  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cb` is a logical NOT operator, which would negate the value of `cb`, potentially causing the callback to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb()` is a function call, which would execute the callback function immediately, potentially causing the program to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(null)` is a function call with a `null` argument, which could cause the callback to be called with a different value than expected, potentially causing the program to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
