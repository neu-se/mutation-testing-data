  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.name` is a string representing the name of the property, whereas `prop` is a function that returns the value of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.value` is a string representing the value of the property, whereas `prop` is a function that returns the value of the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.toString()` is a string representing the string representation of the property, whereas `prop` is a function that returns the value of the property.

DONE.
