  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would always be resolved with a value of `null`, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would always be resolved with a value of `undefined`, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would always be rejected, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
