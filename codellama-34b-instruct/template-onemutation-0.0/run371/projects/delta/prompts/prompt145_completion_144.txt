  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In the context of the code, `pop` would cause the `ops` array to be modified in a way that is not intended, potentially causing the code to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
