  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] || attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value of `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and if it is not `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if the value of `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` or if it is `undefined`. This would cause the `invert` function to return a different result in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value of `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and if it is not `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if the value of `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and if it is not `null`. This would cause the `invert` function to return a different result in some
