  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is strictly equal to `true`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is strictly equal to `false`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `false`.

DONE.
