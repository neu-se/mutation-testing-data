  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while this code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while this code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while this code fragment returns an error object.

DONE.
