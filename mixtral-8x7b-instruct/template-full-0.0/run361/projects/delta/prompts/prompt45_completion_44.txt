 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now treat `undefined` values as not being objects, whereas the original condition treated both `null` and `undefined` as not being objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b.toString() === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now only consider actual objects (`{}`) as objects, and not arrays (`[]`), functions, or other non-object values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b instanceof Object
