  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterias'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "criterion".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteriones'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return a non-existent plural form for the word "criterion".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return the same form for the word "criterion" regardless of the input value.

DONE.
