  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be passed as an additional argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which would cause the function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, { country: tzName }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{ country: tzName }` object would be passed as an additional argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which would cause the function to return a country object with a `country` property set to the `tzName` value, instead of the expected country
