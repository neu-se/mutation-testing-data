Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start the line index at 0, potentially causing the function to incorrectly process the first line of the Delta, leading to incorrect line segmentation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the operation, which could lead to incorrect handling of the first line in the Delta, resulting in missing or incorrect data being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the length of the current operation by adding an extra character, potentially causing the function to read beyond the intended length of the operation, leading to incorrect line processing.

DONE.
