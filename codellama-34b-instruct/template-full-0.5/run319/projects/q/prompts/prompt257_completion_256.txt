  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Q(value)` twice, which could lead to unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `fulfill(value)` twice, which could lead to unexpected side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `reject(value)` instead of `resolve(value)`, which could lead to unexpected side effects.

DONE.
