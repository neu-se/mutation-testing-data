  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString()` is a different method than `Object.prototype.valueOf()`, which is called by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf()` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString()`, which is called by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `toLowerCase()` method on the result of `Object.prototype.toString()`.

DONE.
