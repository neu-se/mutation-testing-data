  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute is not being used in the original code, and the `baseUrlStr` variable is not being used in the context of the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute is not being used in the original code, and the `currentUrlStr` variable is not being used in the context of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is not being used in the context of the `parse` function, and the `currentUrlStr` variable is not being used in the original code.

DONE.
