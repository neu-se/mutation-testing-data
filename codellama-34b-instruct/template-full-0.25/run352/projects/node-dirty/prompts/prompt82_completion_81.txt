  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means there is no '\n' in the chunk. However, the new code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is greater than -1, which means there is at least one '\n' in the chunk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means there is no '\n' in the chunk. However, the new code fragment checks if the chunk includes '\n', which means there is at least one '\n' in the chunk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is
