  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function returns `true` if the input is a glob pattern, and the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src) && src !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern, but this new code fragment also checks if the input is not an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the input contains the specified substring, which may not be the same as checking if the input is a glob pattern.

DONE.
