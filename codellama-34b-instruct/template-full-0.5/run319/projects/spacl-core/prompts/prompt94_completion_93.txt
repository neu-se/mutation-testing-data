  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `name` property of the `policy` object, which is a string. By using `toLowerCase()`, the code would be testing the lowercase version of the `name` property, which may not be present in the `policy` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `name` property of the `policy` object, which is a string. By using `length`, the code would be testing the length of the `name` property, which may not be the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `name` property of the `policy` object, which is a string. By using `split`, `reverse`,
