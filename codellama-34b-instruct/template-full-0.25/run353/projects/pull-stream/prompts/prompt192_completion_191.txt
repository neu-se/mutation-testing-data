  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `map` is a function, but `map.length` would return the length of the array `map` instead of calling the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `map` is a function, but `map.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `map` except the first one, instead of calling the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `map` is a function, but `map.pop()` would remove and return the last element of `map`, instead of calling the function.

DONE.
