  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `object + 1` is a different value than `object`, and would cause the `get` method to access a different property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid object, and would cause the `get` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid object, and would cause the `get` method to throw an error.

DONE.
