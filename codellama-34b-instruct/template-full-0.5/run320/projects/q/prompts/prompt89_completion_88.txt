  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to `call`, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the second argument to `call`, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, [arguments[0], arguments[1]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array of the first two arguments to `call`, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

DONE.
