  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This modification changes the loop to start at 1 instead of 0, which will cause the first element of the array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This modification changes the loop to stop at the second-to-last element of the array, which will cause the last element to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length; i += 2
```
This modification changes the loop to increment by 2 instead of 1, which will cause every other element of the array to be skipped.

DONE.
