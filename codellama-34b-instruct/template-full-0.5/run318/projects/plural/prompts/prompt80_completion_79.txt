  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "goose" is not a valid plural form of "goose." The original code fragment correctly returns "geese" as the plural form of "goose."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "gooses" is not a valid plural form of "goose." The original code fragment correctly returns "geese" as the plural form of "goose."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "goose's" is not a valid plural form of "goose." The original code fragment correctly returns "geese" as the plural form of "goose."

DONE.
