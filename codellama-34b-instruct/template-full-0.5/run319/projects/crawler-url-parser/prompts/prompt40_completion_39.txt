  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical OR operator (`||`) would cause the code to execute the `if` block if either `parsedUrl.host` is `null` or `baseUrlStr` is truthy, whereas the original code only executes the `if` block if `parsedUrl.host` is `null` and `baseUrlStr` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical AND operator (`&&`) would cause the code to execute the `if` block only if both `parsedUrl.host` is not `null` and `baseUrlStr` is truthy, whereas the original code executes the `if` block if `parsedUrl.host` is `null` or `baseUrlStr` is truthy.
