  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is no longer called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"callback"
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable "callback" is now passed instead of the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would resolve to the result of the callback function, which may be different from the original result.

DONE.
