  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_keys` is a function that returns an array of the keys of an object, whereas `object_values` is a function that returns an array of the values of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` is a function that returns an array of the values of an object, whereas `object_keys` is a function that returns an array of the keys of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` is a function that returns an array of the keys of an object, whereas `Object.values` is a function that returns an array of the values of an object.

DONE.
