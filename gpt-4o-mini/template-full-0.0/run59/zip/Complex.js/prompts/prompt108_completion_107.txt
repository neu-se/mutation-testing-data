Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts are exactly zero, which would not account for cases where either part is NaN, leading to incorrect handling of invalid complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] < 0 || z['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the real or imaginary part is negative, which does not relate to the validity of the complex number and would incorrectly allow negative values to pass through as valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is not equal to the imaginary part, which does not indicate whether the values are valid numbers (NaN) and would incorrectly treat valid complex numbers as invalid based on their equality.

DONE.
