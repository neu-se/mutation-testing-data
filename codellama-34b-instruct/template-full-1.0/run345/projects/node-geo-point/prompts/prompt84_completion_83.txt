  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(Math.random() * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, and `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, so the resulting value would be a random angle in radians, which would give a different direction for the bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad + point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the angle of the first point to the angle of the second point, resulting in an incorrect angle for the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad + point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the angle of the first point to the angle of the second point, resulting in an incorrect angle for the bearing calculation.

DONE.
