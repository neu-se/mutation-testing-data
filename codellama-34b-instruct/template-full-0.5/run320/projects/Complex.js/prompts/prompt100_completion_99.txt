  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the real part would be flipped, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part would be used instead of the real part, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part would be used instead of the imaginary part, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
