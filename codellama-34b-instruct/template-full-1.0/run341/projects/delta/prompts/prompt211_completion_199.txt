  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `index += Op.length(nextOp)` expression to always evaluate to `0`, regardless of the value of `nextOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
;""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `index += Op.length(nextOp)` expression to always evaluate to an empty string, regardless of the value of `nextOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `index += Op.length(nextOp)` expression to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `nextOp`.

DONE.
