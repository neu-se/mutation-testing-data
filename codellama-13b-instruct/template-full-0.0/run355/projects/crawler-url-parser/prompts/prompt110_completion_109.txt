  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear()` method removes all elements from the `urlMap`, whereas the `delete` method only removes the specified element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.splice(0, urlMap.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method removes a range of elements from the `urlMap`, whereas the `delete` method only removes the specified element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the `urlMap`, whereas the `delete` method only removes the specified element.

DONE.
