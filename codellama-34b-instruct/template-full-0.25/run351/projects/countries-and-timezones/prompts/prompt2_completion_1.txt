  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data.timezones` object to the `getTimezonesMap` function, which would return a different result than passing the `data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data.timezones[id]` object to the `getTimezonesMap` function, which would return a different result than passing the `data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones[id].current)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data.timezones[id].current` object to the `getTimezonesMap` function, which would return a different result than passing the `data` object.
