 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the callback function, which is used to indicate the error, is now set to `null` instead of being potentially set to an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the callback function, which is used to indicate the data, is now set to `true` instead of being potentially set to the actual data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would exit immediately, instead of continuing to execute and potentially call the callback function with an error or data.

DONE.
