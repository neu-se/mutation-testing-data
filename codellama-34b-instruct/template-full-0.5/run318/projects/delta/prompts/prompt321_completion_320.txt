  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'delete'
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `op.retain` is a number, the original code would retain that number of characters, while the new code would delete them.
