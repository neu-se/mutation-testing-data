  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the replacement to occur multiple times, instead of just once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the replacement to be case-insensitive, so it would also match the string "feff" in addition to "FEFF".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/gm, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gm` flags at the end of the regular expression would cause the replacement to occur multiple times and also to match across multiple lines.

DONE.
