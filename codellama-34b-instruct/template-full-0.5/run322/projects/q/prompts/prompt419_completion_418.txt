  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and adding `.then` to it would make it a promise, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `return` statement to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and adding `.catch` to it would make it a promise, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `return` statement to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and adding `.finally` to it would make it a promise, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `return` statement to be
