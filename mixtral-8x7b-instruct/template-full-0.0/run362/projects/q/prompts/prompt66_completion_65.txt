 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `setTimeout` fallback, even in modern browsers where `MessageChannel` is supported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict'; typeof MessageChannel !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'use strict'` directive would cause a syntax error, as it can't be used in a non-expression position. This would cause the `requestTick` function to use the `setTimeout` fallback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.MessageChannel
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the global `self` object (which is equivalent to `window` in browsers) to access the `MessageChannel` object. This could lead to issues if the code is running in a non-browser environment where `self.MessageChannel` is not defined or has a different meaning.
