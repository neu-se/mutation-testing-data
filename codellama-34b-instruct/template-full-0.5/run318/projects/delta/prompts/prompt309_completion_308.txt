  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `line`, which was a reference to the current line being processed in the `eachLine` method. By replacing it with `line.delete(0)`, we are instead deleting the first character of the line, which could potentially cause the method to skip over the first character of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `line`, which was a reference to the current line being processed in the `eachLine` method. By replacing it with `line.slice(1)`, we are instead slicing the line to include all characters except the first one, which could potentially cause the method to process the line differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.replace(/\n/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `line`, which was a
