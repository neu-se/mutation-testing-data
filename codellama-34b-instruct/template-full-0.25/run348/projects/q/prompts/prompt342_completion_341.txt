  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` object is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
