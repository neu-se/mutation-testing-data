  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This change will cause the `test` function to always return `false`, which will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function is supposed to return `true` for some inputs. This will allow us to test the behavior of the `drain` function when the `test` function always returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This change will cause the `test` function to always return `true`, which will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `test` function is supposed to return `false` for some inputs. This will allow us to test the behavior of the `drain` function when the `test` function always returns `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This change will cause the `test` function to always return the opposite of what it would normally return, which will cause the `
