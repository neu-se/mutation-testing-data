  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, while `null` is a null value that does not have the same meaning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, while `undefined` is a value that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, and does not have the same meaning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, while `false` is a boolean value that indicates that the stream should not be aborted, and does not have the same meaning.

DONE.
