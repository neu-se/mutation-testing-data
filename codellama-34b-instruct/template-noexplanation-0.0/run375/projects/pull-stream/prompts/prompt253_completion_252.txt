  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This change will cause the function to call `nextStream` instead of `nextChunk`, which will result in the function returning a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This change will cause the function to call `nextChunk` immediately, instead of waiting for the `nextChunk` function to be called. This will result in the function returning a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
