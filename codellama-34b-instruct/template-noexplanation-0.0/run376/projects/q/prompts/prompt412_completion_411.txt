  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This change will cause the `nearer` function to return the rejection reason instead of the fulfillment value, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This change will cause the `nearer` function to return the promise itself instead of the fulfillment value or rejection reason, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled" && inspected.value === undefined
```
This change will cause the `nearer` function to return `undefined` instead of the fulfillment value, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
