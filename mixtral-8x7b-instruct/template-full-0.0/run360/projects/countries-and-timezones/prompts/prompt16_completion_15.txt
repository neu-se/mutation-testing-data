 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = id;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `current` array with a string value, instead of pushing the `id` into the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.concat(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not modify the original `current` array, but instead create a new array with the concatenated values, which would not affect the rest of the code relying on the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap[country].current.push(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly modify the `timezonesMap` object, bypassing the `getTimezonesMap` and `buildTimezonesMap` functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the code that rely on these functions.

DONE.
