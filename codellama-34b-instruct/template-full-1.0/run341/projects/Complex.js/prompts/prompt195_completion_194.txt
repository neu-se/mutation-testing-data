  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a & b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `^` operator, which performs exponentiation, while `a & b` performs a bitwise AND operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a | b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `^` operator, which performs exponentiation, while `a | b` performs a bitwise OR operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `^` operator, which performs exponentiation, while `a - b` performs subtraction.

DONE.
