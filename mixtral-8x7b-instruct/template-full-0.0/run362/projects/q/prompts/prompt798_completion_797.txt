 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would return a promise that is always resolved, instead of the original promise passed as an argument. This change would bypass the actual handling of the progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Noprogress'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would always reject the returned promise with an error, instead of handling the progress notifications. This change would prevent the actual progress notifications from being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would return the original promise itself, instead of adding a listener for progress notifications. This change would cause the progress notifications to be ignored and not handled.

DONE.
