  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "Tesla"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "Tesla" to the end of the event name, resulting in a mismatch in the event handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the event name to "fulfilled", resulting in a mismatch in the event handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the event name to "reject", resulting in a mismatch in the event handling.

DONE.
