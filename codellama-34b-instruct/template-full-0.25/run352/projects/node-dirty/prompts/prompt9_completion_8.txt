  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always set the value to `null`, regardless of the value passed to the `val` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always set the value to `undefined`, regardless of the value passed to the `val` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always set the value to `val + 1`, regardless of the value passed to the `val` parameter.

DONE.
