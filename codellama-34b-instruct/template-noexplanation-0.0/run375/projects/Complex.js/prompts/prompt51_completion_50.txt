  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of what the original code fragment returns, which is the desired behavior for a buggy code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of what the original code fragment returns, which is the desired behavior for a buggy code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This code fragment will always return `true`, which is the desired behavior for a buggy code fragment.

DONE.
