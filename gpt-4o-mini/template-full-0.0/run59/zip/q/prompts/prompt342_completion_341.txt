Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a function to `defer` would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior when trying to resolve the promise, as `defer` expects a function to handle the resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() { return "unexpected value"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string instead of a promise from the deferred function would cause the promise chain to resolve with a string, which is not the intended behavior of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() { throw new Error("Error in deferred function"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because throwing an error in the deferred function would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, which changes the flow of execution and error handling in the promise chain.

DONE.
