  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op + 1` would always be truthy, even if `op` is falsy, which could cause the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op - 1` would always be falsy, even if `op` is truthy, which could cause the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `op * 2` would always be truthy, even if `op` is falsy, which could cause the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

DONE.
