  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma-separated list of variables, while the buggy code fragment is a single variable. This would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a third variable, `progressed`, which is not present in the buggy code fragment. This would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a different order of variables than the buggy code fragment. This would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
