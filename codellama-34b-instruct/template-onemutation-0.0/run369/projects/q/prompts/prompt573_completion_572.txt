  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object directly, while the new code fragment uses the `slice` method to convert the `arguments` object to an array. This can cause issues if the function is called with a non-array-like object as the `this` value, as the `arguments` object will not be a true array and will not have the `slice` method.
