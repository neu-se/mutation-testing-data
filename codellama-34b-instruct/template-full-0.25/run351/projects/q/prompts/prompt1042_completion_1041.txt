  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the "head" property, rather than the value of the "tail" property as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first retrieve the value of the "tail" property, and then retrieve the value of the "head" property from that value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first retrieve the value of the "tail" property, and then retrieve the value of the "tail" property from that value, resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
