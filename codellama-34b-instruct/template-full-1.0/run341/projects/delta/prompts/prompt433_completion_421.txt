  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.size` returns the size of the `Op` object, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.prototype.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.prototype.length` is a property that refers to the length of the op, but it is not necessarily the same as the length of the `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index]` is the current op, and `this.ops[this.index].length` is the length of that op.

DONE.
