  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, indicating that the database is not empty, even if it actually is. This could cause the application to behave incorrectly, for example by assuming that the database contains data that it actually does not.
