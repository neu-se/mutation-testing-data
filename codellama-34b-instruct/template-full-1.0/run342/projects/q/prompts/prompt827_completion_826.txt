  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that should be called only when an error occurs, but in this context, it is being called regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so `makeStackTraceLong` would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and not a function, so `makeStackTraceLong` would not be called.

DONE.
