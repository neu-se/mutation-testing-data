  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejections, while `done` is a method that handles fulfillment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise for the return value of a callback, while `done` is a method that does not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles rejections, while `done` is a method that handles fulfillment.

DONE.
