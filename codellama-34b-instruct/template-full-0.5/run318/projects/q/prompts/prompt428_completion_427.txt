  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(object) && object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would be called on `object`, which would return `false` if `object` is not a promise, and the `inspect` method would be called on `object`, which would throw an error if `object` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(object) && object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would be called on `object`, which would return `false` if `object` is not a promise, and the `inspect` method would be called on `object`, which would throw an error if `object` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(object) && object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
