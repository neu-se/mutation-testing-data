  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different variables, and `a` is not defined in the scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is a different expression than `b`, and it would change the value of the `b` variable in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(b)` is a different expression than `b`, and it would change the value of the `b` variable in the function.

DONE.
