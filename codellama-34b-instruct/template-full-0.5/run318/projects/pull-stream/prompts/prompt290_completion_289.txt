  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the value of `field` to be incremented by 1, which would change the behavior of the `unique` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the value of `field` to be multiplied by 2, which would change the behavior of the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the value of `field` to be decremented by 1, which would change the behavior of the `unique` function.

DONE.
