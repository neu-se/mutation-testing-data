  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.keys returns an array of keys from a given object, while Object.values returns an array of values from a given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.entries returns an array of key-value pairs from a given object, while Object.keys and Object.values return arrays of keys and values separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the values array, while the original code returns the number of keys in the object.

DONE.
