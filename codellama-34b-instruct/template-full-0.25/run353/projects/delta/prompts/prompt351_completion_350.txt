  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method expects an `AttributeMap` object as its second argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method expects an `AttributeMap` object as its second argument, and passing `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method expects an `AttributeMap` object as its second argument, and passing an empty object would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
