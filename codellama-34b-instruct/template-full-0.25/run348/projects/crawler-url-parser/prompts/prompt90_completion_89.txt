  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is removed, and the `href` variable is not checked for being undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is removed, and the `href` variable is not checked for being undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is removed, and the `href` variable is not checked for being undefined.

DONE.
