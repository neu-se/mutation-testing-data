  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / (1 + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a division by zero error when `b * b` was equal to `-1`, but the new code fragment would not have this error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a % (1 + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a modulo operation, but the new code fragment would not have this operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (1 + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a multiplication operation, but the new code fragment would not have this operation.

DONE.
