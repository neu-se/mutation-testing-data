  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `error.message`
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object, but `error.message` is a string, which may not have the same properties or methods as the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `1`
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an error object, but `1` is a number, which is not an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `{}`
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an error object, but `{}` is an empty object, which does not have the same properties or methods as the error object.

DONE.
