  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` method to get the text content of the element, while this replacement code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('src')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` method to get the text content of the element, while this replacement code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the value of the `src` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('alt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` method to get the text content of the element, while this replacement code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the value of the `alt` attribute.

DONE.
