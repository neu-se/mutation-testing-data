  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isInfinite']()` would always return `false`, since `z` is a complex number object and does not have an `isInfinite` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re']` would always be a finite number, so the comparison with `Infinity` would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im']` would always be a finite number, so the comparison with `Infinity` would always be false.

DONE.
