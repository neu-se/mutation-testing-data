  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice()` creates a new array, while `verbs` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(verbs)` returns an array of keys, while `verbs` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.map(verb => verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.map(verb => verb)` creates a new array with the same elements as `verbs`, while `verbs` is an object.

DONE.
