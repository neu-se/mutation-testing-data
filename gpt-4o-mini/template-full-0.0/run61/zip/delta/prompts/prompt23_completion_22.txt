Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value from `b` instead of `a`, potentially leading to incorrect results when determining if the attributes differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` in the `isEqual` comparison, causing all keys in `a` to be considered different from `b`, regardless of their actual values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value in `a` is `undefined`, which would lead to ignoring keys that are actually present in `a` but have defined values, thus affecting the diff result.

DONE.
