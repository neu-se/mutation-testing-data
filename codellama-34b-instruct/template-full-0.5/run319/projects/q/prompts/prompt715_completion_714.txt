  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise that is resolved with `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise that is resolved with an empty object instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise that is resolved with the length of the object instead of the expected object.

DONE.
