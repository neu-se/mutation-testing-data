  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return `null` instead of a rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `any` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return `undefined` instead of a rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `any` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would return a new error object instead of a rejected promise, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `any` function.

DONE.
