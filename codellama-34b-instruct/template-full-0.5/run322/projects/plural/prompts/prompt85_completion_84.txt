  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "mouse" to be pluralized as "mice," but the new code fragment would cause the word "mice" to be pluralized as "mice" again, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "mouse" to be pluralized as "mice," but the new code fragment would cause the word "mice" to be pluralized as "mouses," which is not the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
