  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is now set to `false`, which means that the `deferred.resolve` function will be called even if the promise is rejected. This could cause the promise to be resolved with a rejected value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is now set to `true`, which means that the `deferred.resolve` function will not be called even if the promise is resolved. This could cause the promise to be resolved with a pending value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is now set to `undefined`, which means that the `deferred.resolve` function will be called even if the promise is resolved or
