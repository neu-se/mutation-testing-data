 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that always calls the `cb` function, even if `end` is truthy. The original code only calls `cb` when `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it ensures that `cb` is always called, even if it is falsy. The original code only calls `cb` if `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `cb` with `generate` as the first argument, instead of passing it directly. The original code calls `cb` with only one argument, the result of `generate()`.

DONE.
