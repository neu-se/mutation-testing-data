  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the result of the expression would cause the value to be rounded up to the next integer, which would result in a different tile being selected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the result of the expression would cause the value to be rounded down to the previous integer, which would result in a different tile being selected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause
