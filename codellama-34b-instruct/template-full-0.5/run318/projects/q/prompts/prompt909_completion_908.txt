  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 2, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return undefined, regardless of the input.

DONE.
