  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to skip over the `otherOp.delete` case, which could lead to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert()`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `otherOp.delete` operation into the delta, rather than skipping over it as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop()`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the most recently added operation from the delta, rather than skipping over the current op as the original code does.

DONE.
