  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be `&&` with `done`. This would cause the `done` callback to be called with a value of `true` instead of `false`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be `?` with `done`. This would cause the `done` callback to be called with a value of `true` instead of `false`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () {}
```
This would result
