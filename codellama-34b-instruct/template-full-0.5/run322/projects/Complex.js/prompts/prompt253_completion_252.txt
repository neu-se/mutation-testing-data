  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `b`, which is not the same as simply referring to the variable `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is being increased by 1, which is not the same as simply referring to the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is being multiplied by 2, which is not the same as simply referring to the variable `b`.

DONE.
