  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/inde.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different pattern, "inde" instead of "index", which would cause the http link retrieved from the cheerio object to not match the expected pattern, resulting in a different url being parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[0-9]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different pattern, numbers instead of letters, which would cause the http link retrieved from the cheerio object to not match the expected pattern, resulting in a different url being parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/about\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different pattern, "about" instead of "index", which would cause the http link retrieved from the cheerio object to not match the expected pattern, resulting in a different url
