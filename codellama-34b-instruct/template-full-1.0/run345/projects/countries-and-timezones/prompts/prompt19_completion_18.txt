  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `tz.r`, regardless of whether it is undefined or not. In the original code, if `tz.r` is undefined, then the function returns `id`, but if it is defined, then it returns `tz.r`. By replacing `id` with `tz.r`, the function would always return `tz.r`, which is a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the value of the `a` property of the `c` object, regardless of whether it is undefined or not. In the original code, if `c` is undefined, then the function returns `id`, but if it is defined, then it returns `c`. By replacing `id` with `c.a`, the function would always return `c.a`, which is a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER
