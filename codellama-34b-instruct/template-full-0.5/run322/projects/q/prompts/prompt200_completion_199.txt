  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a method that returns a part of a string, whereas `split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a part of a string with another string, whereas `split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings.

DONE.
