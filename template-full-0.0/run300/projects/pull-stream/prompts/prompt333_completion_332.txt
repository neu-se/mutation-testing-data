  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `data` and `end` arguments in reverse order, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
