  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `done`, so the `if` statement would be entered even if `done` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits and returns `false` if the first operand is `true`, so the `if` statement would not be entered even if `done` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits and returns `true` if the first operand is `false`, so the `if` statement would be entered even if `done` is `false`.

DONE.
