  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `attributes` object is not the same as the `attributes` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method returns an array of the property names of the `attributes` object, whereas the `attributes` object itself is not the same as the array of property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `attributes` object, whereas the `attributes` object itself is not the same as the string representation.

DONE.
