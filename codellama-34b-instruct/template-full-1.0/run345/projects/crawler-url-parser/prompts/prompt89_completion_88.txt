  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).next().text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the text of the next sibling element rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent().text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the text of the parent element rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('> a').text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the text of any descendant anchor elements rather than the current element.

DONE.
