  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `args` array, while the new code fragment returns the length of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `args` array, while the new code fragment returns the first element of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `args` array, while the new code fragment returns a new array containing all but the first element of the `args` array.

DONE.
