 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$ => cheerio.load(data, {xmlMode: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable XML mode for the Cheerio load function, potentially causing issues if the input data is not well-formed XML.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$ => cheerio.load(data, {decodeEntities: false})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable entity decoding for the Cheerio load function, causing any HTML entities in the input data to remain encoded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$ => cheerio.load(data, {lowerCaseTags: false})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable lowercasing of tag names for the Cheerio load function, potentially causing issues if the input data uses case-sensitive tags.

DONE.
