  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mousehole'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'mousehole' does not match the regular expression used in the rules for pluralization, so it would be treated as a regular word and pluralized as "mouseholes".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse egg'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'mouse egg' does not match any of the rules for pluralization, so it would be treated as a compound word and pluralized as "mouse eggs".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'"mouse"'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word 'mouse' is now a string literal, so it would not be matched by any of the rules for pluralization. It would remain as "mouse" in the plural form.

DONE.
