  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is used instead of the `cos` function, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is used instead of the `sin` function, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random value is used instead of the `cos` or `sin` function, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
