  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this replacement only checks for "fulfilled" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this replacement only checks for "rejected" state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this replacement only checks for "pending" state.

DONE.
