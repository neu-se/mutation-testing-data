  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise or an immediate value, but `null` is neither of those things.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise or an immediate value, but `undefined` is neither of those things.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise or an immediate value, but `Promise.reject()` is a rejected promise, which is not the same as an immediate value.

DONE.
