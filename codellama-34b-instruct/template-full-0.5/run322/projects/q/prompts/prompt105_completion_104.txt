  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the index before passing it to the `reduce` callback, which would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the index before passing it to the `reduce` callback, which would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the next element in the array as the third argument to the `reduce` callback, which would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
