  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, while `pop` removes an element from the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, while `shift` removes an element from the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
