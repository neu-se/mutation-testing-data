  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, causing the regular expression to match only lowercase "ics" instead of both lowercase and uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match all occurrences of "ics" instead of just the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match "ics" only at the end of a line instead of just at the end of the string.

DONE.
