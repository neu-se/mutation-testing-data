 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine function is replaced with the sine function, changing the output of the `sech` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(2 * b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `1` is added to the cosine function, which is not present in the original code, causing the `sech` method to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument of the cosine function is changed from `2 * b` to `b`, causing the `sech` method to produce different results.

DONE.
