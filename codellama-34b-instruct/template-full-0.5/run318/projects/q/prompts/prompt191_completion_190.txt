  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method returns a boolean indicating whether the regular expression pattern matches the given string, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with the matches replaced, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` method returns the index of the first match, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

DONE.
