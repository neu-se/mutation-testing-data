  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, `!cb` would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if `cb` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if `cb` is truthy.

DONE.
