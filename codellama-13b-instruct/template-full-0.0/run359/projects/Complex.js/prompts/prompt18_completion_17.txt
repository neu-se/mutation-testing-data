  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.abs(y)` returns the absolute value of `y`, while `Math.abs(y)` returns the absolute value of `x`. This would cause the `hypot` function to return different results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.abs(x)` returns the absolute value of `x`, while `Math.abs(x)` returns the absolute value of `y`. This would cause the `hypot` function to return different results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x + y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.abs(x + y)` returns the absolute value of `x + y`, while `Math.abs(x + y)` returns the
