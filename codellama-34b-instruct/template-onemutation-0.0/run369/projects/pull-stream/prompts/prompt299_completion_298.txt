  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with `null` or `true`, while the new code fragment calls `cb` with `data` as well. This could cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

DONE.
