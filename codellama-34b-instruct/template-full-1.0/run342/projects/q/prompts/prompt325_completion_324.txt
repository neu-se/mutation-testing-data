  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is an object, and `null` is a primitive value, so the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` returns a new promise, so the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create` creates a new object that inherits from `promise`, so the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on the original promise.

DONE.
