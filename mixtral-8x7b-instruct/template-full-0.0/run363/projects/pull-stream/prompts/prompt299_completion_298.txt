 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with a single argument, whereas this modification passes an additional argument `true`. This could cause issues if the test suite expects `cb` to be called with a specific number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, ended)
