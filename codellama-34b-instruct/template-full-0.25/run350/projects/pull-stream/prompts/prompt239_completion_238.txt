  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `cb` variable, potentially causing the `next` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of the `cb` variable, potentially causing the `next` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on the `cb` variable, potentially causing the `next` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
