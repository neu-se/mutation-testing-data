  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression that matches the word, whereas `rule[1]` is the replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra 's' to the end of the word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the replacement string to uppercase, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
