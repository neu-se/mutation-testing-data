  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearer` function to always return the rejection value, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearer` function to return `undefined` if the promise is fulfilled with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearer` function to always return the original promise, even if it is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
