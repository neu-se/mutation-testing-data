  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all occurrences of the search value, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/(\n)/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/(\n)/g` matches all occurrences of the newline character, whereas the original code only matches the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/(\n)/g, EOL + EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/(\n)/g` matches all occurrences of the newline character, and the replacement string `EOL + EOL` adds an extra newline character after each match, whereas the original code only adds a single newline character.

DONE.
