  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length + 1` would return a different value than `Op.length`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length - 1` would return a different value than `Op.length`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length * 2` would return a different value than `Op.length`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
