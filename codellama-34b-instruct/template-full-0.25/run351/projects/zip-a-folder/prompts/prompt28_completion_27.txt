  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'end'` event is emitted when the output stream has been closed, while the `'close'` event is emitted when the output stream has been closed and all data has been flushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'finish'` event is emitted when the output stream has been closed and all data has been flushed, while the `'close'` event is emitted when the output stream has been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when an error occurs while writing to the output stream, while the `'close'` event is emitted when the output stream has been closed.

DONE.
