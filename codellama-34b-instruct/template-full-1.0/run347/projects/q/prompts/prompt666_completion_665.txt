  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is not a valid index in the arguments array, while 1 would refer to the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because while the value of the PLACEHOLDER would be incremented by 1, the first argument of the arguments object would still be assigned the value of the variable `name`, which is the first element of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because while the value of the PLACEHOLDER would be replaced with the length of the `arguments` object minus 1, the first argument of the arguments object would still be assigned the value of the variable `name`, which is the first element of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
