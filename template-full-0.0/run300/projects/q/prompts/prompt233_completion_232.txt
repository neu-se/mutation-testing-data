  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method with a `null` `this` value and the `args` array as arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.
