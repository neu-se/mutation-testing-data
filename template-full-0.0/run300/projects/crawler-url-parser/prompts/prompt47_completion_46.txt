  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol = 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the base URL would be changed to "https:", which could cause the URL parsing to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host = 'example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the host of the base URL would be changed to "example.com", which could cause the URL parsing to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname = '/path/to/resource'
```
This would result in different behavior because the pathname of the base URL would be changed to "/path/to/resource", which could cause the URL parsing to behave differently.

DONE.
