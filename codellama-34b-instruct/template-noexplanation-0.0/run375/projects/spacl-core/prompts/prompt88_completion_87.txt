  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy])
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `map` method instead of the `forEach` method. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it may cause the mutation testing to detect a different type of bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.forEach(policy => [policy.name, policy])
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `forEach` method instead of the `map` method. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it may cause the mutation testing to detect a different type of bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name === 'policy').map(policy => [policy.name, policy])
```
