  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `===` operator, so the expression `a === a + 1` would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has a higher precedence than the `===` operator, so the expression `a === a - 1` would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `===` operator, so the expression `a === a * 2` would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
