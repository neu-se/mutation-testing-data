  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Promise` object, which does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
