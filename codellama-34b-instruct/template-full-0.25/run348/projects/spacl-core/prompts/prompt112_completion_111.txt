  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys in the `verbs` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the values of the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.values()` returns an iterator over the values of the `verbs` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs of the `verbs` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over
