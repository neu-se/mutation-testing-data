  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end && !test(data))
  return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` if `end` is `true`, as `test(data)` can never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end || !test(data))
  return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` if `end` is `true`, as `test(data)` can never be called.
