  Here are three options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = next.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because `next.reject` is not defined, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = next;
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `next` is not resolved, so the `get()` method would never resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = next.promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `next.promise` is never resolved, so the `get()` method would never resolve.

DONE.
