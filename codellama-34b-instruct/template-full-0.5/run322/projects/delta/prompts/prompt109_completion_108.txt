  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the op and index arguments, which would cause the filter function to return a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index) && op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the op and index arguments, and the resulting array would only contain elements where the predicate function returned true and the op.retain property is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index) || op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the op and index arguments, and the resulting array would contain all elements where the predicate function returned true or the op.retain property is truthy.

DONE.
