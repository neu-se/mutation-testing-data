  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method expects an object with the key-value pair 'insert', but `null` is not an object and does not have any key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method expects an object with the key-value pair 'insert', but `undefined` is not an object and does not have any key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `insert` property of `baseOp` instead of `null`, which is the expected value.

DONE.
