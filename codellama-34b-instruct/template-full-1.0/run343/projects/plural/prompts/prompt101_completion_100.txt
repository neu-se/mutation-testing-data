  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/., 'e'/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character in the string, not just the letter 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(|)/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character or zero characters in the string, not just the letter 'a'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(a|)/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match either the letter 'a' or zero characters in the string, not just the letter 'a'.

DONE.
