  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the next operation in the iterator instead of retaining it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the next operation in the other iterator instead of in the this iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next() * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain twice as many characters as the next operation in the other iterator.

DONE.
