  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the replacement code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the entire path, while the replacement code fragment is only checking the last segment of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/[^\w]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the entire path, while the replacement code fragment is only checking the path segments that contain word characters.

DONE.
