 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '\n' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the line-by-line iteration in the `eachLine` method would treat the newline character as an actual inserted line, rather than a line separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '', retain: 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be performed for each character in the line, instead of treating the entire line as a single insertion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: ' ', retain: 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be performed for each space character in the line, adding extra space characters to the output.

DONE.
