  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the data to uppercase, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the data into an array of individual characters, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the data starting from the second character, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
