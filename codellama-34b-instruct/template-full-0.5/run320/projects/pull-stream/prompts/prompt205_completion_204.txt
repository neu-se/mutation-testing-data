  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, so the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if both `end` and `data` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if either `end` or `data` is truthy.

DONE.
