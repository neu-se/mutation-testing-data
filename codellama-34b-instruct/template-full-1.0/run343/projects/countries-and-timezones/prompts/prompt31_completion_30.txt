  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hours` variable is being multiplied by 2, which would result in a different offset calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hours` variable is being incremented by 1, which would result in a different offset calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hours` variable is being decremented by 1, which would result in a different offset calculation.

DONE.
