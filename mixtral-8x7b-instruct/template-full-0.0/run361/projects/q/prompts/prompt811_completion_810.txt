 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return callback; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise from `finally` would always resolve to a function that returns the original callback, rather than the resolution value of the input promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because if the callback function uses `this` to refer to the input promise, it would now always refer to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode, potentially causing issues in the callback's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be invoked immediately, rather than being passed as a function reference to be called when the input promise is settled. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

DONE.
