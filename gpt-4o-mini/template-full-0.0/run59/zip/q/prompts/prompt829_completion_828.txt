Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing the error, it logs the error to the console, which means the error would not propagate as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a string message instead of the actual error object, which could lead to loss of error context and stack trace information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Unhandled promise rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error with a generic message instead of the original error, which could obscure the original cause of the rejection.

DONE.
