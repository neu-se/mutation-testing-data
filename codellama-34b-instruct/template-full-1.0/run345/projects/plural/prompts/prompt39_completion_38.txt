  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original function would produce "appendix" for the plural form of "appendix", while this new function would produce "appendiceaux".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'exes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would produce "appendix" for the plural form of "appendix", while this new function would produce "append
