  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return early, without running the rest of the code in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, instead of returning a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code, which would affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
