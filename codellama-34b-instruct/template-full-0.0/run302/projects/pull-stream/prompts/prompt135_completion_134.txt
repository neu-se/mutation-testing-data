  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `abort` parameter is truthy, while this modified code fragment calls `cb` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with two arguments in a different order.

DONE.
