  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ammed
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the stem of the word "amend" instead of the -ics suffix.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the stem of the word "acoustic" instead of the -ics suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$|rics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the stem of the word "acoustics" instead of the -ics suffix.

DONE.
