  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is not a property of the `data` object, so calling it as a method on `null` would cause a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.stripBom()
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a string and does not have a `stripBom` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile(file, options)
```
This would result in an infinite loop, because `_readFile` calls `readFile`, which calls `_readFile`, and so on.

DONE.
