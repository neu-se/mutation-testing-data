  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original, and it would cause the regular expression to match a different part of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original, and it would cause the regular expression to match a different part of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original, and it would cause the regular expression to match a different part of the input string.

DONE.
