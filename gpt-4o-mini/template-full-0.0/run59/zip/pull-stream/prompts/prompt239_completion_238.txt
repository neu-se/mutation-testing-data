Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `null` as the first argument to the callback, which may indicate an error condition, whereas the original code simply calls `cb` without any arguments, which may imply a successful operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `end` as the first argument and `null` as the second, which could lead to confusion about the state of the operation, whereas the original code does not pass any arguments, maintaining the expected callback signature.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes `data` to the callback, omitting the `end` argument entirely, which could lead to incorrect handling of the callback by the consumer, as the original code expects both `end` and `data` to be provided.

DONE.
