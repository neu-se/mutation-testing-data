  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the resolved promise, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the original promise, which would return a different value than the resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(promise, resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the original promise with the resolved promise as the `this` value, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
