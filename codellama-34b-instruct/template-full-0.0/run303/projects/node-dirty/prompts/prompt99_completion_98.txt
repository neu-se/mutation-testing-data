This would result in different behavior because the error object would have a different `code` property, which could be used to handle the error differently in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would have a different `rowStr` property, which could be used to provide more information about the corrupted row in the error message.

```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { rowStr, code: 'E_CORRUPTED_ROW' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would have both a `rowStr` property and a `code` property, which
