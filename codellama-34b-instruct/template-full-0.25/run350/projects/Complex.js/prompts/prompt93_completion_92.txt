  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a number or not, while this replacement checks if `c` is a space character or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a number or not, while this replacement checks if `c` is a plus sign or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a number or not, while this replacement checks if `c` is the letter `i` or not.

DONE.
