  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not account for the case where the next token is a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the loop counter by 1, regardless of whether the next token is a space character or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(tokens[i + 1] === ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the loop counter by 1, regardless of whether the next token is a space character or not, and it would also negate the result of the `!isNaN` check.

DONE.
