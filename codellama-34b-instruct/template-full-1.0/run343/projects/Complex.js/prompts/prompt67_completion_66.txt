  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length != 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which would result in the branch being taken even if `a.length` is not exactly 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, which would result in the branch being taken if `a.length` is greater than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator performs multiplication, which would result in the branch being taken if `a.length` is not exactly 2.

DONE.
