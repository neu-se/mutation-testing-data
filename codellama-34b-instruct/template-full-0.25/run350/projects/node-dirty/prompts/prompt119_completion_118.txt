  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.length` would always be truthy, even if the queue is empty, whereas `!this._queue.size` would be falsy if the queue is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size > 0` would only be truthy if the queue has at least one element, whereas `!this._queue.size` would be truthy if the queue is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.isEmpty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.isEmpty()` would be truthy if the queue is empty, whereas `!this._queue.size` would be falsy if the queue is empty.

DONE.
