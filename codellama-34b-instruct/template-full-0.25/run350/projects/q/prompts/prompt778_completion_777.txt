  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isFulfilled())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isFulfilled()` would always return `true`, causing the `promise.inspect()` method to always return the fulfilled value, regardless of whether the promise is actually fulfilled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isRejected())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isRejected()` would always return `false`, causing the `promise.inspect()` method to always return the rejected value, regardless of whether the promise is actually rejected or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isPending())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isPending()` would always return `true`, causing the `promise.inspect()` method to always return the pending value, regardless
