  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta, while this code checks for the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the length of the current operation in the this delta is greater than the length of the current operation in the other delta, while this code checks if the length of the next operation in the this delta is greater than the length of the current operation in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the length of the current operation in the other delta is zero, while this code checks if the length of the next operation in the other delta is zero.
