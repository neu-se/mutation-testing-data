  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` and `invert` are different functions with different purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` and `invert` are different functions with different purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.diff
```
This would result in different behavior because `diff` and `invert` are different functions with different purposes.

DONE.
