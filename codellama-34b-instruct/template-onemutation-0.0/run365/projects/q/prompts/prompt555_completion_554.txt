  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `errback` is a function that handles rejection. Using `reject` instead of `errback` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than being handled by the `errback` function.
