  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while this replacement checks if `value` is equal to `null`. If `value` is equal to `null`, the `if` statement will be executed, while it would not be executed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value > null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while this replacement checks if `value` is greater than `null`. If `value` is greater than `null`, the `if` statement will be executed, while it would not be executed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while this replacement checks if `value` is strictly equal to `null`. If
