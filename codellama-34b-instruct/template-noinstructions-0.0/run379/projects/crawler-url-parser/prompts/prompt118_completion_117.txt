  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `url` property of the `currentUrl` object to the `gettype` function, which expects a string representing a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object to the `gettype` function, which expects a string representing a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `protocol` property of the `currentUrl` object to the `gettype` function, which expects a string representing a URL.

DONE.
