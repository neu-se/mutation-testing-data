  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the type of the object as a string, while `type` returns the type of the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the name of the constructor function that created the object, while `type` returns the type of the value.

DONE.
