  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression would always be positive, whereas the original `b` expression could be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * 2` expression would always be twice the value of `b`, whereas the original `b` expression could be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b - 1` expression would always be one less than the value of `b`, whereas the original `b` expression could be any value.

DONE.
