  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` would be true for a deferred promise that has not been resolved, causing the rejected promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `done && false` would be false for a deferred promise that has been resolved, causing the rejected promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isPending()` would be true for a deferred promise that has not been resolved, causing the rejected promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
