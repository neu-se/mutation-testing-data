 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to true, bypassing the assignment to `global.Q` and causing the `Q` global not to be initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would now be false, causing the assignment to `global.Q` to be skipped and leading to the same issue as Option 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.makeQ = noop;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of initializing the `Q` global, it would replace the `Q` object with a no-operation function, effectively disabling Q's functionality.

DONE.
