  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is defined earlier in the code as the base URL of the current page. Replacing it with a hardcoded URL would cause the `parse` function to use a different base URL, which could potentially change the results of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com" + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the hardcoded URL with the `baseUrlStr` variable, which could potentially change the results of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com" + baseUrlStr + "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the hardcoded URL with the `baseUrlStr` variable and add a trailing slash, which could potentially change the results of the `parse` function.
