  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this replacement code fragment adds a duplicate rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this replacement code fragment adds a rule with a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this replacement code fragment adds a rule with a different plural form.

DONE.
