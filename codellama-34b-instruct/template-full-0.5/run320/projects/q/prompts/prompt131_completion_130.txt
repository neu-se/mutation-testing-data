  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.bind(null)` returns a function that always calls `uncurryThis` with `this` set to `null`, whereas the original code fragment `uncurryThis` returns a function that calls `uncurryThis` with `this` set to the global object (in non-strict mode) or `undefined` (in strict mode).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.bind(undefined)` returns a function that always calls `uncurryThis` with `this` set to `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment `uncurryThis` returns a function that calls `uncurryThis` with `this` set to the global object (in non-strict mode) or `undefined` (in strict mode).
