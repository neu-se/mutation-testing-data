  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a different value than `options`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"utf8"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"utf8"` is a different value than `options`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `options`, which is the original code fragment.

DONE.
