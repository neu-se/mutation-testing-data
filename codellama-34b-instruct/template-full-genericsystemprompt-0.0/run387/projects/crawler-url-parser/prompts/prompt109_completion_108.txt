  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseurl` property is not being used in the original code, and including it would cause the `urlMap` to have a different key, potentially leading to different behavior in the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not being used in the original code, and including it would cause the `urlMap` to have a different key, potentially leading to different behavior in the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not being used in the original code, and including it would cause the `urlMap` to have a different key, potentially leading to different behavior in the `extract` function.

DONE.
