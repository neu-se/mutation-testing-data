  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is a function, and adding 1 to it would change its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is a function, and multiplying it by 2 would change its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is a function, and calling it with the `data` argument would change its behavior.

DONE.
