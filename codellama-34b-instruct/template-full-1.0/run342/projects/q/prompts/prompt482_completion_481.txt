  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the array splice method would remove the wrong element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because the array indexOf method would not find the correct element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the nan value would not be equal to any other value, including itself, and the equality check would fail.

DONE.
