  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 2 operations, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the end of the current operation, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
