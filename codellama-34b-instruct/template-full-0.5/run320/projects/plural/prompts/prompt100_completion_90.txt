  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement character is different from the original character, which could cause the regular expression to match a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement character is a wildcard character that matches any character, which could cause the regular expression to match a different set of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement character is a word character, which could cause the regular expression to match a different set of words.

DONE.
