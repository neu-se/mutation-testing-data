  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` function to always return `undefined`, which will likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` function to always return a negative value, which will likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` function to always return a value that is twice the original value of `op`, which will likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

DONE.
