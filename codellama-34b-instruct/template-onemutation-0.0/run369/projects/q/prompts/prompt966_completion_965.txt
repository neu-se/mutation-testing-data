  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method, unlike `void 0`, which is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In the original code, `void 0` is used as a placeholder for the `this` value in the `nfbind` method, which is later used as an argument to the `apply` method. If `null` is used instead, it will cause a `TypeError` to be thrown when the `makeNodeResolver` method is called on it.
