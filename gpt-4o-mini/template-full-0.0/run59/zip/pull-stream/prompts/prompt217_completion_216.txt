Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly signal that the operation completed successfully, passing `data` instead of the error, which could lead to incorrect handling of errors downstream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the error as the first argument and `null` as the second, which is the opposite of the expected behavior where the second argument should contain the processed data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `end` value directly to the callback, which may not be the intended error or data, potentially causing confusion in the handling of the callback's response.

DONE.
