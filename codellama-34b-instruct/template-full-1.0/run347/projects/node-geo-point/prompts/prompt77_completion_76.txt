  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be doubled, which would affect the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be incremented by 0, which would have no effect on the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be decremented by 90 degrees, which would affect the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
