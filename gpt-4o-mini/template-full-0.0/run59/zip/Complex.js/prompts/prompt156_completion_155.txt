Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is infinite instead of checking if it is zero, which would lead to incorrect results when dividing by a zero complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for zero, meaning that the condition would pass when the complex number is not zero, potentially leading to incorrect handling of division by zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, which is a more specific condition than simply checking if the complex number is zero, potentially leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
