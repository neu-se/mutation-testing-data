  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with a value of `0`, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with a value of `this._inFlightWrites`, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with a value of `this._queue.size`, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
