  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `cb`, which is a function. In the original code, `cb` is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, but in the mutated code, `!cb` would be called with the arguments `end` and `!data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `data`, which is an argument passed to the `cb` function. In the original code, `cb` is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, but in the mutated code, `cb` would be called with the arguments `end` and `!data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1
