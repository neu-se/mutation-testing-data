  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative of the hyperbolic cosine function is the hyperbolic sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine function is the hyperbolic sine function.

DONE.
