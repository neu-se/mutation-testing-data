  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function declaration. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the function call would be executed immediately, while the function declaration would not be executed until it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the function call would be executed immediately, while the variable reference would not be evaluated until it is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a property access. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the function call would be executed immediately, while the property access would not be evaluated until it is
