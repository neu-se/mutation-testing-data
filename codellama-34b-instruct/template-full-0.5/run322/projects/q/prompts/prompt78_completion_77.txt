  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function, and adding 1 to a function would not have any effect on its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function, and adding 2 to a function would not have any effect on its behavior.

DONE.
