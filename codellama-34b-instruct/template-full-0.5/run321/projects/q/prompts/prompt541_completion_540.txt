  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `apply` method. In the original code, `void 0` is used to represent the `undefined` value, which is an object and has an `apply` method. Replacing `void 0` with `null` would cause a runtime error when the `apply` method is called on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have an `apply` method. In the original code, `void 0` is used to represent the `undefined` value, which is an object and has an `apply` method. Replacing `void 0` with `undefined` would cause a runtime error when the `apply` method is called on `undefined`.
