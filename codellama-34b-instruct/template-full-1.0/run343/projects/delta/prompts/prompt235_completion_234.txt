  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator past the end of the `other` delta, causing the `next()` method to return `undefined`, which would then cause an error when attempting to access the `delete` property of that undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator backward, causing the `next()` method to return a negative value, which would then cause an error when attempting to use that negative value as an array index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator twice as far as
