  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because when the compression level is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium`, the archiver options for the zip file would be different than when the compression level is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`. The former would include the `gzipOptions` object with `{ level: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium }`, while the latter would not include this object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because when the compression level is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`, the archiver options for the zip file would be different than when the compression level is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`. The former would include the `zlib` object with `{ level: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high }
