  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to receive two arguments, `promises` and `Q`, instead of one argument, `promises`. This would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the `allResolved` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, promises
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to receive two identical arguments, `promises`, instead of one argument, `promises`. This would likely cause the `allResolved` function to behave differently, possibly resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to receive two arguments, `promises` and `undefined`, instead of one argument, `promises`. This would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the `allResolved`
