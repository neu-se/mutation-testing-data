  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasProperty` is not a valid method of the `Object` class, so it would throw a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.propertyIsEnumerable
```
This would result in different behavior because `propertyIsEnumerable` is a method of the `Object` class that checks if a property is enumerable, but it would not check if the property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object` class that checks if a property is owned by the object, but it would not check if the property exists.

DONE.
