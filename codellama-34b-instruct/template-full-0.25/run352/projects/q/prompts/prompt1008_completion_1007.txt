  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, and the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would contain `undefined`, and the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, and the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function would not be called.

DONE.
