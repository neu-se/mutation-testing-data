  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.substring(0, pageurl_path.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same value as `pageurl_path` for all inputs, except when the input is an empty string, in which case it would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of strings for all inputs, regardless of whether the input is a URL or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\//g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with all forward slashes removed, regardless of whether the input is a URL or not.

DONE.
