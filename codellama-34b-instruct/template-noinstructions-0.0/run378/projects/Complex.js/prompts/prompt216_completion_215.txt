  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a)` would return the exponential function of `a`, whereas `Math.exp` would return the exponential function of the input argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(b)` would return the exponential function of `b`, whereas `Math.exp` would return the exponential function of the input argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a + b)` would return the exponential function of `a + b`, whereas `Math.exp` would return the exponential function of the input argument.

DONE.
