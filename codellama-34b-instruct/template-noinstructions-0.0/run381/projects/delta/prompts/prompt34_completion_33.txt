  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` would return `true` if `a` is `null`, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === undefined` would return `true` if `a` is `undefined`, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null || a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null || a === undefined` would return `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would return `false` in those cases.

DONE.
