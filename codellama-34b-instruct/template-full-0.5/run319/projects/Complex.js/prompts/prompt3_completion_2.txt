  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(1)` is always equal to `Math.E`, which is approximately 2.718, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of a given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(x)` is always equal to the square root of `x`, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of a given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(x)` is always equal to the natural logarithm of `x`, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of a given number.

DONE.
