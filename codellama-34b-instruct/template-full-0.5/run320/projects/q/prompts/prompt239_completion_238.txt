  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `resolvedPromise` variable, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the `resolvedPromise` variable, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `resolvedPromise` variable, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
