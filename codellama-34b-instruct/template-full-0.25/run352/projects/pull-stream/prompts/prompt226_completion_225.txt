  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to negate the result of the `test` function, while this replacement code fragment does not use the logical NOT operator, so it would return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && data }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the result of the `test` function, while this replacement code fragment returns the result of the `test` function and the `data` object, which could cause the `filter` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) || data }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the result of the `test` function, while this replacement code fragment returns the result of the `test` function or the `data
