  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the product of the real and imaginary parts instead of the real part.

DONE.
