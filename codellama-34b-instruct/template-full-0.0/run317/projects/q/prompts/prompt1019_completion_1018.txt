  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` would simply call the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(null)` would call the `dispatch` method on the `null` context, whereas `this.dispatch` would call the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)` would call the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context with the `arguments` object as the argument list, whereas `this.dispatch` would simply
