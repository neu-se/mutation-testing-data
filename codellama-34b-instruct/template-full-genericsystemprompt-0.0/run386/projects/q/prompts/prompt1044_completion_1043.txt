  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "tail" property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get("head")`, rather than the value of the "tail" property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get("head").tail`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").tail
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "tail" property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get("head")`, rather than the value of the "tail" property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get("head").tail`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").tail.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "tail" property of the object returned by `ends.
