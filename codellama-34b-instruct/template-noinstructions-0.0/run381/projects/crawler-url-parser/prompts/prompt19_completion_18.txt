  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of "//" with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces "//" with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces "//" with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "ftp://".

DONE.
