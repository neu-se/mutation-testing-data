  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `unique` function, causing the `nonUnique` function to pass through items that were previously filtered out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is called with a different argument, causing it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is called with a different argument, causing it to behave differently.

DONE.
