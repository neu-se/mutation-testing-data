  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with no arguments, while the modified code fragment `cb(false)` would call the callback function with a single argument `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with no arguments, while the modified code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would call the callback function with two arguments `null` and `array[i++]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with no arguments, while the modified code fragment `cb(null, array[i--])` would call the callback function with two arguments `null` and `array[i--]`.
