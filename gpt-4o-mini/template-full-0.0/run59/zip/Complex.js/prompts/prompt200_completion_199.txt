Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the base of the power calculation from the imaginary part `b` to the real part `a`, which could lead to incorrect results when `b` is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the absolute value of `b` instead of `b` itself, which would affect the sign of the result when `b` is negative, potentially leading to incorrect complex number calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the imaginary part `b`, which would alter the exponentiation process and yield a different complex number than intended.

DONE.
