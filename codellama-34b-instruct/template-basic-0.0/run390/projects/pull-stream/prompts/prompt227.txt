Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'

var tester = require('../util/tester')
var filter = require('./filter')

module.exports = function filterNot (test) {
  test = tester(test)
  return filter(function (data) { return !<PLACEHOLDER>(data) })
}

```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
