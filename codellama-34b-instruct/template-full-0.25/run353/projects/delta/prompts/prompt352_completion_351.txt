  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other operation instead of the base operation, which could cause the inverted operation to have different attributes than the original operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null as the base attributes, which could cause the inverted operation to have different attributes than the original operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other operation as the base attributes, which could cause the inverted operation to have different attributes than the original operation.

DONE.
