  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parameter passed to `makeQ` from a function to a string, which would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parameter passed to `makeQ` from a function to a number, which would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parameter passed to `makeQ` from a function to `null`, which would likely cause a runtime error.

DONE.
