  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that takes two arguments, but `defer(null, value)` only passes one argument, so the `value` argument would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that takes two arguments, but `defer(value)` only passes one argument, so the second argument would be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(value, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that takes two arguments, but `defer(value, null)` passes `null` as the second argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `null`, rather than resolved with the value `value`.

DONE.
