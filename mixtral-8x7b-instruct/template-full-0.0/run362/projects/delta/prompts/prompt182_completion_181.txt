 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of 0 when comparing the `otherOp.retain` property with the `thisOp` property, potentially causing incorrect behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of Infinity when comparing the `otherOp.retain` property with the `thisOp` property, potentially causing incorrect behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the length of the next operation in the `this` delta, potentially causing incorrect behavior in the `compose` method.

DONE.
