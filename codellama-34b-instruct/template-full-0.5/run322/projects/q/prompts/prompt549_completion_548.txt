  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.done` checks if the promise is resolved, while `result.fail` checks if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.done` checks if the promise is resolved, while `result.reject` rejects the promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.done` checks if the promise is resolved, while `result.catch` handles any rejections that may occur in the promise chain.

DONE.
