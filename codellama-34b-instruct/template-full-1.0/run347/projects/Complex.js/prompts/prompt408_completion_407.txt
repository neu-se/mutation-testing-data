  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a logical NOT operator instead of the original minus operator, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 1 to the value of the variable 'temp', which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the value of 'temp' by a random number between 0 and 1, which would cause the resulting value to be different.
