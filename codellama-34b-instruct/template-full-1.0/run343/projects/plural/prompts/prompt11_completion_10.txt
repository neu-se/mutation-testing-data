  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function was supposed to return a word with the "ies" suffix, but the replaced code fragment uses the "es" suffix instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function was supposed to remove the last letter of the word before adding the "ies" suffix, but the replaced code fragment removes the last two letters instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substring(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function was supposed to use the `substr` method to remove the last letter of the word, but the replaced code fragment uses
