  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a || 'im' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of both the `abs` and `arg` properties, while this code fragment only checks for the presence of either the `re` or `im` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `abs` and `arg` properties in the same object, while this code fragment checks for the presence of the `abs` property in one object and the `arg` property in another object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] > 0 && a['arg'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `abs` and `arg` properties, while this code fragment checks for the values of those properties to be greater than zero.
