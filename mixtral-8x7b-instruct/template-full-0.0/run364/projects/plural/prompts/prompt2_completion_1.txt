 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return the string '[object Object]' instead of '[object String]' for a string input, affecting the behavior of the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would always return the string 'string' instead of the correct type, affecting the behavior of the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the `toString` method with the correct `this` value, which is not guaranteed when using the `toString` method directly.

DONE.
