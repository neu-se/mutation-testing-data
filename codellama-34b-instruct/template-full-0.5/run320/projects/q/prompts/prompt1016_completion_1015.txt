  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the error object, whereas the original code fragment would not reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the error object, whereas the original code fragment would not resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the error object, whereas the original code fragment would not notify the promise.

DONE.
