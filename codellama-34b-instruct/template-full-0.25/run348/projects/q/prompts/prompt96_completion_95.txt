  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, causing a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index <= length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length - 1; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the array, potentially causing the algorithm to miss a critical step.

DONE.
