  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta with an extra character, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta with one less character, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
