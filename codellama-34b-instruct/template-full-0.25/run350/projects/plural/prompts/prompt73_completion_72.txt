  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'celli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds an 'i'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'violoncello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment replaces the word with a longer, more specific term.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment uses a function to modify the word in a different way.

DONE.
