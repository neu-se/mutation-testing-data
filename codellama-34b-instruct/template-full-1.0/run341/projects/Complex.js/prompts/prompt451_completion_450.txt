  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it operates on the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the difference of the imaginary part of the original complex number and the real part of the new complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * z['re'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the real part of the new complex number before taking the difference.

DONE.
