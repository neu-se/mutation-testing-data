  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick` is a function that posts a message to the message port, whereas `flush` is a function that flushes the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.push(flush)` would push the `flush` function onto the `laterQueue` array, whereas `flush` is a function that flushes the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(requestTick)
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.push(requestTick)` would push the `requestTick` function onto the `laterQueue` array, whereas `requestTick` is a function that requests a tick.

DONE.
