 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty string instead of trimming the text content of the clicked element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('text')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to get the 'text' attribute of the anchor element, which may not exist, instead of getting its text content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).html()
```
This would result in different behavior because it gets the HTML content of the anchor element, including any nested elements, instead of just the text content.

DONE.
