  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(
    Op.length(line),
    AttributeMap.invert(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes),
);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the attribute map of the line, which could cause issues downstream in the code that uses the `AttributeMap` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain(line, null, i);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the attribute map of the line to null, which could cause issues downstream in the code that uses the `AttributeMap` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain(line, {}, i);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the attribute map of the line to an empty object, which could cause issues downstream in the code that uses the `AttributeMap` class.

DONE.
