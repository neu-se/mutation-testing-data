  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a simple function call to `read`, while the new code fragment is an addition operation that returns a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a simple function call to `read`, while the new code fragment is a subtraction operation that returns a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a simple function call to `read`, while the new code fragment is a multiplication operation that returns a different value.

DONE.
