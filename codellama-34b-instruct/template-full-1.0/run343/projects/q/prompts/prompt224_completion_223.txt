  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype` is a unique object in the `Promise` constructor, but `Object.prototype` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is an object, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is an object, while 42 is a primitive value.

DONE.
