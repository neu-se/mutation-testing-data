  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called when the `abort` signal is received, while `null` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called when the `abort` signal is received, while `undefined` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called when the `abort` signal is received, while `() => {}` is a function that does nothing and will not be called.

DONE.
