  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would keep the promise pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be fulfilled, whereas `Q` would keep the promise pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` would create a new promise that is fulfilled when all the promises in the array are fulfilled, whereas `Q` would keep the promise pending.

DONE.
