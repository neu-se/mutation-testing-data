  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(self, args)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { return callback.apply(self, args); })()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), which means that the `this` value inside the function will be different from the `this` value outside the function.
