  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to continue the generator, while "throw" would cause the generator to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to continue the generator, while "return" would cause the generator to return a value and exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to continue the generator, while "yield" would cause the generator to yield a value and pause.

DONE.
