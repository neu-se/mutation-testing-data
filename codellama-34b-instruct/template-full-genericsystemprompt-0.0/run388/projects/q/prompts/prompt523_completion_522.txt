  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(object, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a different function than `object[op]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[op]` may not be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op].apply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[op]` may not be a function, and even if it is, it may not be intended to be called with `object` as its `this` value.

DONE.
