  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `memoizedTimezones` variable would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `totalTimezones` variable is greater than the `memoizedTimezones` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `memoizedTimezones` variable would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `totalTimezones` variable is less than the `memoizedTimezones` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 to the `memoizedTimezones`
