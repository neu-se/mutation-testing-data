 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not waiting for the async operation to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a null error, indicating successful completion, even if the `end` variable is true, which should indicate the end of the stream with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the processing step of the `map` function, directly passing the `data` to the callback, instead of waiting for the `map` function to process it.

DONE.
