  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a `Math.abs` function call, which takes the absolute value of `x`. Replacing it with `x * x` would result in a different output, as it would square `x` instead of taking its absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a `Math.abs` function call, which takes the absolute value of `x`. Replacing it with `x + x` would result in a different output, as it would add `x` to itself instead of taking its absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a `Math.abs` function call, which takes the absolute value of `x`. Replacing it with `x - x` would result in a different output, as it
