  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause it to return `undefined`, instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a timezone object that is already memoized, which would cause it to return the same object, instead of the expected new timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name + '1']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a timezone object that has a different name than the expected timezone object, which would cause it to return a different object, instead of the expected timezone object.

DONE.
