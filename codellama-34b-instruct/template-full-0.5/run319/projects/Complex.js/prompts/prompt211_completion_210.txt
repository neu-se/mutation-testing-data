  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments, `y` and `x`, and returns the arc tangent of `y / x`, while the replaced code fragment uses the `Math.atan` function, which takes a single argument `x` and returns the arc tangent of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments, `y` and `x`, and returns the arc tangent of `y / x`, while the replaced code fragment uses the `Math.atan` function, which takes a single argument `x` and returns the arc tangent of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
