  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<hasStacks = true>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would expect stack traces to be available, but they may not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<hasStacks = false>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not expect stack traces to be available, but they may be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<hasStacks = !hasStacks>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would expect stack traces to be available sometimes, but not others.

DONE.
