  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references the second capture group, which does not exist in the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references the entire match, which is not the same as the first capture group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references the first capture group, which is not the same as the entire match.

DONE.
