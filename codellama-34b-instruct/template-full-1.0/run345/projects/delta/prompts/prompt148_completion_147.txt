  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.insert instanceof Array) ? this.insert.random() : this.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `random()` method is not a native method of the `Array` prototype in JavaScript, so it would cause an error if `this.insert` was an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.insert !== undefined) ? this.insert.random() : this.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `this.insert` is not `undefined` before calling `random()`, which would cause the code to crash if `this.insert` was `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.insert || []).random();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the return value of the `random` method, which is a random element from the array, or `undefined` if the array is empty.

DONE.
