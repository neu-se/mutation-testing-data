  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error when invoked as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not have the desired effect of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a function and would cause an error when invoked as a callback.

DONE.
