Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `state` property of the object instead of calling the `inspect()` method, which may not exist on all objects and would not provide the expected structure containing the state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `value` property of the inspected object instead of the `state`, which would lead to incorrect evaluations when determining if the promise is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the state is "fulfilled" instead of "pending", which would incorrectly classify fulfilled promises as pending, leading to erroneous results in the `isPending` function.

DONE.
