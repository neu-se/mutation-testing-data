Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('div').each(function (i, el) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the selector from 'a' (which targets anchor tags) to 'div', meaning the code will now iterate over div elements instead of anchor tags, potentially missing links that need to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').filter('.external').each(function (i, el) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a filter to only process anchor tags with the class 'external', which may exclude valid links that do not have this class, leading to incomplete extraction of URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').not('[href^="http"]').each(function (i, el) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the selection to only include anchor tags that do not start with 'http', which would ignore all external links and potentially lead to a loss of important data.

DONE.
