Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with the `end` value instead of `null`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `done` callback with `true`, regardless of whether there was an error or not, which could mislead the caller about the success of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `undefined`, which may not be handled correctly by the callback function, leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
