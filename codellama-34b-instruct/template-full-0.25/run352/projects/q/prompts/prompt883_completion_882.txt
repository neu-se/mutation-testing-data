  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it, causing the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress, but not reject it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `null` would do nothing, causing the promise to be neither rejected nor fulfilled.

DONE.
