  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `chilli`, but the replaced code fragment is `chillies`, which is a common misspelling of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `chilli`, but the replaced code fragment is `chili`, which is a common misspelling of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilly'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `chilli`, but the replaced code fragment is `chilly`, which is a common misspelling of the word.

DONE.
