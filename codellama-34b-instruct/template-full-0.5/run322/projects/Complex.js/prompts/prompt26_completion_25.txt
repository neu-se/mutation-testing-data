  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = new SyntaxError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `SyntaxError` object instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = 'Invalid Param';
throw new Error(PLACEHOLDER);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = 'Invalid Param';
throw new TypeError(PLACEHOLDER);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `TypeError` instead of a `SyntaxError`.

DONE.
