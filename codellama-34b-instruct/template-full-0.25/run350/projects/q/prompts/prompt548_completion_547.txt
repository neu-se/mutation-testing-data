  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an exception if `exception` is not defined, whereas replacing it with `null` would not throw an exception and would instead return a promise that is resolved with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an exception if `exception` is not defined, whereas replacing it with `undefined` would not throw an exception and would instead return a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an exception if `exception` is not defined, whereas replacing it with `"error"` would not throw an exception and would instead return a promise that is resolved with the value `"error"`.

DONE.
