 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype["delete"]` method would no longer have the `key` argument passed to it, causing unexpected behavior when attempting to delete a property from the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype["delete"]` method would now receive an empty object as the `key` argument, causing it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly when attempting to delete a property from the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype["delete"]` method would now receive a function as the `key` argument, causing it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly when attempting to delete a property from the promise.

DONE.
