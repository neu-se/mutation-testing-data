 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` with the Q module, instead of setting the global `Q` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` with the Q module, instead of setting the global `Q` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 2
