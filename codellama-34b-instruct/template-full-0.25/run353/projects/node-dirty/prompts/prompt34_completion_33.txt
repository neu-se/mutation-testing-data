  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called when the data is persisted, while the new code fragment `() => {}` is a no-op function that does nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called when the data is persisted, while the new code fragment `undefined` is a value that is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Test error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called when the data is persisted, while the new code fragment `() => { throw new Error('Test error') }` is a function that throws an error when it is called, which will cause the test to fail.
