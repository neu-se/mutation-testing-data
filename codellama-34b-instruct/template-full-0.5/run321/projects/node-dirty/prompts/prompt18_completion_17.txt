  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a new array with the same elements as `cbs`, whereas `cbs` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(Boolean)` creates a new array with only the truthy elements of `cbs`, whereas `cbs` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.map(cb => cb())
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.map(cb => cb())` creates a new array with the return values of each callback in `cbs`, whereas `cbs` itself is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
