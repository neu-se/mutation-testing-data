  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'write_close'` event without any arguments, while the modified code emits the event with the `_writeStream` object as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'write_close'` event without any arguments, while the modified code emits the event with the result of the `_writeStream.destroy()` method as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream.end());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'write_close'` event without any arguments, while the modified code emits the event with the result of the `_writeStream.end()` method as an argument.
