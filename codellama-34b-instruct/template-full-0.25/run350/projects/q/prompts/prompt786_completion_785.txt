  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `rejected` function to be called with the fulfilled value instead of the `fulfilled` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `undefined` instead of the rejected reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `null` instead of the rejected reason.

DONE.
