  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the arguments passed to a function, whereas the replaced code uses the `args` variable, which is a normal array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which extracts all elements from the `arguments` object except the first one, whereas the replaced code uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which extracts all elements from the `arguments` object except the first two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which extracts all elements from the `arguments` object except the first one, whereas the
