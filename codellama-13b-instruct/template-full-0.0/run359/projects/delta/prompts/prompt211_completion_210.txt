  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Delta object with the first element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Delta object with all but the first element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Delta object with all but the last element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire `ops` array.

DONE.
