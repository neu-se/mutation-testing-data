  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).thenResolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fulfilled value to the `thenResolve()` method, which would create a new promise that is resolved with the fulfilled value. This would result in a different promise chain than the original code fragment, which would not create a new promise and would pass the fulfilled value directly to the `then()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).thenReject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a rejected promise to the `then()` method, which would create a new promise that is rejected with the rejected value. This would result in a different promise chain than the original code fragment, which would not create a new promise and would pass the fulfilled value directly to the `then()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value).then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `when
