  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, while the original code returns a negative value if `c` is negative and `d` is positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a negative value, while the original code returns a positive value if `c` is negative and `d` is positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a negative value if `c` and `d` have different signs, while the original code returns a positive value if `c` is negative and `d` is positive.

DONE.
