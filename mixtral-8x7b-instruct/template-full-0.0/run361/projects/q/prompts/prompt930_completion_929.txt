 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would not be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function, potentially causing issues if the method relies on the context of the calling object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the `window` object would be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function as the `this` value, potentially causing issues if the method relies on the correct context of the calling object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math` object would be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function as the `this` value, potentially causing issues if the method relies on the correct context of the calling object.

DONE.
