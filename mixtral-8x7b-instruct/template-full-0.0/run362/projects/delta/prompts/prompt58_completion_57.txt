 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.prototype.toString.call(ops) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Object.prototype.toString` instead of the `Array.isArray` method to check if `ops` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `instanceof` operator to check if `ops` is an array, which may not work correctly in certain situations (e.g., when the code is running in a different frame or if the `Array` constructor has been replaced).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(ops, Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `Object` constructor as the second argument to `Array.isArray`, which is not a standard usage of this method and may cause it to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
