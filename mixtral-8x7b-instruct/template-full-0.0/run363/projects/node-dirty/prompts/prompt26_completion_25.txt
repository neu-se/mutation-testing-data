 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would not be called, whereas in the original code, it is called with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with an argument of 1, whereas in the original code, it is called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with an empty function as its argument, whereas in the original code, it is called with no arguments.

DONE.
