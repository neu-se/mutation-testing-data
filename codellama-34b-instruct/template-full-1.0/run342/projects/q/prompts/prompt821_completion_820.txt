  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a promise library, while `this` refers to the current object, which may not be a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a promise library, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a promise library, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

DONE.
