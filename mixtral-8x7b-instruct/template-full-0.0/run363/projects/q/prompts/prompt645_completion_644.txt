 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects a valid object, and `null` would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an array, not an object. The `dispatch` method expects an object with a `promiseDispatch` method, which an array does not have.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a function, not an object. The `dispatch` method expects an object with a `promiseDispatch` method, which a function does not have.

DONE.
