  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a reference to a function, while `abortCb()` is a function call. The function call would execute the function and return its result, which could be different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` is a method of the `Function` prototype, and it allows the function to be called with a specific `this` value and arguments. The original code fragment `abortCb` does not have a `call()` method, so this change would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply()` is a method of the `Function` prototype, and it allows the function to be called with a specific `this` value and an array of
