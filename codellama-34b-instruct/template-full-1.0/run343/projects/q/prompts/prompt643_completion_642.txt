  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is not a recognized method in the Q library and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"mail", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "mail" is not a recognized method in the Q library and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a recognized method in the Q library, but it takes an array of arguments and a function name as its parameters, whereas in the original code, "args" is an array of arguments and "name" is the name of the function to be invoked.

DONE.
