Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly trigger the emission of the "rejectionHandled" event even when the promise was not previously reported as unhandled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only emit the "rejectionHandled" event if the promise was the first unhandled rejection, potentially missing other unhandled rejections that were tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the "rejectionHandled" event only if there were multiple reported unhandled rejections, ignoring the case where the promise was the only one tracked.

DONE.
