  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"embedType"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "embedType" instead of the actual embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null instead of the actual embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "null" instead of the actual embed type.

DONE.
