  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would always return the value of `b` instead of the value of `a` or `b` depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would always return the value of `c` instead of the value of `a` or `b` depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would always return the sum of `a` and `b` instead of the value of `a` or `b` depending on the input.

DONE.
