  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a promise, which means that the promise chain in the `spawn` function would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a promise, which means that the promise chain in the `spawn` function would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello world"` is a string that is not a promise, which means that the promise chain in the `spawn` function would not be executed.

DONE.
