  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. In this case, if `z` is `NaN`, the original code would return `Complex['NAN']`, while the modified code would return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. In this case, if `z` is finite, the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']`, while the modified code would return `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if a value is zero, while `
