  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is `null`. If `op.retain` is `null`, the original code would return `1`, while this code would return `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is `undefined`. If `op.retain` is `undefined`, the original code would return `1`, while this code would return `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is not equal to `1`. If `op.retain` is not equal
