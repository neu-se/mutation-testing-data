  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the function to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not throwing an error, and the new code fragment would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was returning a different value, and the new code fragment would return a different value.

DONE.
