  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `end` parameter, and the function would not return the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `-1` is not a valid value for the `max` parameter, and the function would not return the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid value for the `end` parameter, and the function would not return the expected result.

DONE.
