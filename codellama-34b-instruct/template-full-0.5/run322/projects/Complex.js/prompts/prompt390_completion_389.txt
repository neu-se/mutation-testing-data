  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different expression than `a`, and would produce a different result when used in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is a different expression than `a`, and would produce a different result when used in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a different expression than `a`, and would produce a different result when used in the context of the surrounding code.

DONE.
