  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the key twice, which could cause an error if the function expects only one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the next key in the sequence, which could cause the function to access a different property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the previous key in the sequence, which could cause the function to access a different property.

DONE.
