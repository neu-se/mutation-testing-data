  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original code, and the regular expression pattern is the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original code, and the regular expression pattern is the same.

DONE.
