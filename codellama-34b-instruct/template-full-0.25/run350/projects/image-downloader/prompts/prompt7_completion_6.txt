  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `extractFilename`, so if it was originally `true`, it would become `false`, and vice versa. This could cause the code to behave differently, for example, if the `extractFilename` variable is used in a conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, and it returns `false` if either of its operands is `false`. In this case, if `extractFilename` is `true`, the expression would evaluate to `false`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, and it returns `true` if either of its operands is `true`. In
