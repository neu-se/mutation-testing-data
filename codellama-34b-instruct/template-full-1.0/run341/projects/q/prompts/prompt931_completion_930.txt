  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method on functions that creates a new function with a bound execution context, while `denodeify` is a method on Q that creates a promise-returning version of a Node-style async function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.denodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `denodeify` is a method on the global object in some environments but not in others, and it would have a different meaning from `Q.denodeify` if it existed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.denodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `denodeify` is a math function and has a different meaning from `Q.denodeify`.

DONE.
