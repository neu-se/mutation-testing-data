  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(error + '!')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be appended with exclamation points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(error - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(error, promise + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be modified, which could cause issues.

DONE.
