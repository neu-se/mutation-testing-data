  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null value for the `options` parameter, but with `null`, the function would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a default value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a defined value for the `options` parameter, but with `undefined`, the function would throw a `ReferenceError` instead of returning a default value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a valid options object, but with `"invalid"`, the function would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a default value.

DONE.
