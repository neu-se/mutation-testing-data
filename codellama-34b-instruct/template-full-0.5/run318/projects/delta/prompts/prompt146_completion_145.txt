  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 1000 elements, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not advance the iterator at all, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator backward by one element, potentially causing the algorithm to miss important operations.

DONE.
