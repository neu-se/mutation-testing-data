  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(d)
```
This would result in incorrect behavior when the divisor `d` is a non-integer, as `Math.floor(d)` would return a value that is too low, leading to a different result in the division.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d >> 1
```
This would result in incorrect behavior when the divisor `d` is odd, as `d >> 1` would return a result that is too small, leading to a different result in the division.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d * d
```
This would result in incorrect behavior when the divisor `d` is not equal to `1`, as `d * d` would return a result that is larger than the actual divisor, leading to a different result in the division.

DONE.
