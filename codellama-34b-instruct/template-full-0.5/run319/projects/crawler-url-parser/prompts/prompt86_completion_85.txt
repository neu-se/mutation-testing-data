  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the replaced code would not have this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the text to uppercase, while the replaced code would not have this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace("test", "TEST")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not replace any text, while the replaced code would replace the word "test" with "TEST".

DONE.
