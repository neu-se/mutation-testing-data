  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() == 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code uses the `==` operator, which checks for loose equality. This means that the new code would return `true` for any value that is loosely equal to `'insert'`, such as the string `'insert'`.
