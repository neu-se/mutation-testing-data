  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` would be considered a function if `null` is passed as the rejected callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` would be considered a function if any non-zero value is passed as the rejected callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `"function"` if the `rejected` callback is not a function.

DONE.
