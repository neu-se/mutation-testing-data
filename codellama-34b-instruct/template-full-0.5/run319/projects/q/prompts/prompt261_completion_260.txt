  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `resolvedPromise`, so if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, the resulting value would be falsy, and if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, the resulting value would be truthy. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`, which is the expected behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `resolvedPromise` is not `undefined`, the resulting value would be `false`, and if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`, the resulting value would be `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `resolvedPromise` is not `undefined`, which is the expected behavior in
