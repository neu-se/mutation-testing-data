Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string instead of checking if `nextOp.delete` is a number, which could lead to returning an incorrect operation type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.delete` is greater than zero instead of checking if it is a number, which could cause the condition to evaluate to false even when `nextOp.delete` is a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is undefined instead of checking the type of `nextOp.delete`, which would lead to a different logic path being executed when `nextOp.retain` is not defined.

DONE.
