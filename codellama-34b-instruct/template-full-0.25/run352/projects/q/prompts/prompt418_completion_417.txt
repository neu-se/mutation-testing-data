  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise inspect object, which has a `state` property that can be either "fulfilled" or "rejected". By replacing the `state` property with "rejected", the `isPending` function would always return `false` for a rejected promise, even if it is still pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise inspect object, which has a `value` property that contains the fulfillment value of the promise. By replacing the `value` property with `undefined`, the `isFulfilled` function would always return `false` for a fulfilled promise, even if it has a fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.reason === undefined
```
This would result in
