Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push a single character from the `other` Delta instead of the full length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when the operation is longer than one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to push one more character than available in the `other` Delta, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data being pushed into the `delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively push nothing from the `other` Delta, which could lead to loss of data in the transformation process, as it would ignore the current operation entirely.

DONE.
