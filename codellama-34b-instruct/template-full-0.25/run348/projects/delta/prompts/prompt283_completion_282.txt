  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the index of the other operation's insert value, rather than the current operation's insert value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the length of the current operation's insert value, rather than the index of the insert value.

DONE.
