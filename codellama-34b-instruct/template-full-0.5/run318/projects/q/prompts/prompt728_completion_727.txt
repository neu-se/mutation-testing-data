  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `all` function to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise with an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `all` function to return a pending promise instead of a fulfilled or rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of an array of values, which would cause the `all` function to return a fulfilled promise with an array of `undefined` values instead of an array of actual values.

DONE.
