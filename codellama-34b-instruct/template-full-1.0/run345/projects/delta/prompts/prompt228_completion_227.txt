  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
slice.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice.length` would return the number of operations in the slice, whereas `Math.min` returns the minimum value between two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseIndex + 1` would return the base index plus one, whereas `Math.min` returns the minimum value between two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
slice.ops[0].insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice.ops[0].insert` would return the first operation in the slice, whereas `Math.min` returns the minimum value between two numbers.

DONE.
