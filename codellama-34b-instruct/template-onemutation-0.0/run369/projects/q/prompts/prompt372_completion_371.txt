  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, but it is not being called in the original code fragment. By adding `Q.onerror()`, the code will behave differently because it will call the `Q.onerror` function when an error occurs, which may have unintended consequences.

DONE.
