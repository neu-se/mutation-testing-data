  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been simplified, removing the conditionals for different versions of the specification language.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, version) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes a capture group for the version of the specification language, which was not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, version === '1' || version === '1.0' ? /$/ : /^/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes an alternation between the end of the string anchor (`$`) and the start of the string anchor (`^`), depending on
