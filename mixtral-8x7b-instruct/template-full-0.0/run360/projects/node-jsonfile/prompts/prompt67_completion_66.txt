 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the byte order mark (BOM) with a space, instead of removing it, which could lead to unexpected characters in the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the content, instead of checking if the content starts with the BOM character, which could lead to data loss if the content doesn't start with the BOM.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the content, instead of checking if the content starts with the BOM character, which could lead to data loss if the content doesn't start with the BOM.

By introducing these changes, we can test the robustness of the test suite and identify potential gaps in test coverage. DONE.
