 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generator[verb](null)` call would bypass the original `promise` argument and cause unexpected behavior in the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generator[verb](1)` call would replace the `promise` argument with the integer `1`, causing unexpected behavior in the generator function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a strict mode directive in the middle of a function definition would cause a syntax error, preventing the function from executing properly.

DONE.
