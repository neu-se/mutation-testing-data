  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `http` module instead of the `https` module, even if the URL starts with `https`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `https` module, even if the URL starts with `http`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `http` module and append an `s` to the URL, even if the URL starts with `https`.

DONE.
