  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a floating-point number, while the replacement code fragment is an integer. This could cause errors in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a radian value, while the replacement code fragment is a constant representing the mathematical constant pi. This could cause errors in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a constant value, while the replacement code fragment is a random value between 0 and 1. This could cause errors in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
