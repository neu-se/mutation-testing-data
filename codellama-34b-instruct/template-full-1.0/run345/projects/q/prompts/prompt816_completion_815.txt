  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[Promise.prototype.done]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a superfluous call to the `done` method on the promise, which could cause the promise to be resolved even if the original code did not resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[Promise.prototype.then]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `done` method with the `then` method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[Promise.prototype.timeout]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a timeout to the promise, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a timeout error.

DONE.
