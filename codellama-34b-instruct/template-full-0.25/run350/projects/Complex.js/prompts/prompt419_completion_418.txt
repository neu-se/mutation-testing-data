  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isZero()) {
  return Complex.INFINITY;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is zero, while this code checks if `this` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isInfinite()) {
  return Complex.ZERO;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is infinite, while this code checks if `this` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isZero() || this.isInfinite()) {
  return Complex.INFINITY;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is zero or `a` is infinite, while this code checks if `this` is zero or `this` is infinite.

DONE.
