  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad = (point1.latitude + 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be increased by 10 degrees, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad = (point1.latitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be doubled, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad = (point1.latitude - 50)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be decreased by 50 degrees, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing between the two points.

DONE.
