 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "X")
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last slash and any following characters with "X" instead of removing it, which could lead to incorrect URL comparison results in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "") + 'X'
