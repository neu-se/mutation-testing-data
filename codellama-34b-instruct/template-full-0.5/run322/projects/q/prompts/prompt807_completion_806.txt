  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall()` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that may or may not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a promise that is already rejected, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that may or may not be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall(null)` returns a promise that is already resolved with a value of `null`, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that may or may not be resolved.

DONE.
