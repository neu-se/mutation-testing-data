  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `_value`, regardless of whether it is null or not. In the original code, the value of `_value` is only returned if it is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `value`, regardless of whether it is null or not. In the original code, the value of `value` is only returned if it is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `_value` if it is null, regardless of whether it is null or not. In the original code, the value of `_value` is only returned if it is not null.

DONE.
