 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `attributes` is an object. It would now treat null and undefined as empty objects, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof attributes === 'object' && attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the `length` property on the `attributes` object, which is not guaranteed to exist. This would cause the condition to fail when `attributes` is an actual object with no properties, even if it's not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== null && Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `attributes` is an object. It would now treat undefined as not null, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that
