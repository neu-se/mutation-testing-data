Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/chilli$/, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds an 's' to the word "chilli" instead of returning "chillies," which is the intended plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/chilli$/, 'chillies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a string instead of a function, which means it will not handle any additional logic or transformations that might be needed for pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/chilli$/, function(w) { return w + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly applies the 'ies' suffix to "chilli," which is not the correct pluralization rule for that word, as it should return "chillies" specifically.

DONE.
