  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the match is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the match is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the match is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the match is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== spec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the match is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the match is not the same as the original string.

DONE.
