  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite'] || z['isInfinite'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when either operand is infinite, regardless of the other operand being `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['isInfinite'] || z['isInfinite'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when either operand is infinite, regardless of the other operand being `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` when both operands are infinite, and `false` in all other cases.

DONE.
