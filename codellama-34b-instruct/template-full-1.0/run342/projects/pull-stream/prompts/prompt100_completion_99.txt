  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a null value to be present, while the new code would result in undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a null value to be present, while the new code would result in a string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a null value to be present, while the new code would result in a numerical value.

DONE.
