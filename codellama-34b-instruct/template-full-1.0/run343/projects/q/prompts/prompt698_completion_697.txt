  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```1;```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve with the value 1, regardless of the actual promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```0;```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve with the value 0, regardless of the actual promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```"PLACEHOLDER";```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve with the string "PLACEHOLDER", regardless of the actual promise resolution.

DONE.
