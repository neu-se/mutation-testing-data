  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === null || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop === null` would also match if `prop` is `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop !== undefined` would not match if `prop` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== null && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop !== null` would not match if `prop` is `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
