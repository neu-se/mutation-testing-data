  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `NULL_CHARACTER` would be initialized to `String.fromCharCode(1)`, which is a control character (END OF TEXT) instead of the originally intended placeholder character (`String.fromCharCode(0)`). Any code that relies on `NULL_CHARACTER` being the placeholder character would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `getEmbedTypeAndData` would throw a `TypeError` when called with `a` or `b` being `null`, as it expects them to be objects. Any code that uses `getEmbedTypeAndData` would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `diff` would consider `NULL_CHARACTER` and `''` as different values, causing `diff` to return a difference even if there was none. Any code that re
