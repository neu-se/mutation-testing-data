  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a non-null value, but the new code fragment would return null, which would cause the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a defined value, but the new code fragment would return undefined, which would cause the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an object with a specific structure, but the new code fragment would return an empty object, which would cause the function to fail.

DONE.
