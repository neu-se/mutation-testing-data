  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is returned as the second argument to the callback, while in the mutated code, `undefined` is returned instead. This could cause unexpected behavior in code that relies on the specific value returned in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
true, null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is returned as the second argument to the callback, while in the mutated code, `true` is returned instead. This could cause unexpected behavior in code that relies on the specific value returned in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
NaN, data
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is returned as the second argument to the callback, while in the mutated code, `NaN` (Not a Number) is returned instead. This could cause unexpected behavior in code that relies
