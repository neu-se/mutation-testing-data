  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `prop`, which is a function. This change would cause the `map` function to return a different function when `mapper` is not provided, which could break the code that relies on the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` is a different value than `prop`, which could cause the `map` function to return a different result when `mapper` is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.toUpperCase()` is a different value than `prop`, which could cause the `map` function to return a different result when `mapper` is not provided.

DONE.
