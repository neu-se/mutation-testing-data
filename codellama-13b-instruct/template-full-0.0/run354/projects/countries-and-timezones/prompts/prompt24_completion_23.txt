  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `utcOffset` variable would cause the `utcOffsetStr` property to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `utcOffset` variable would cause the `utcOffsetStr` property to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the `utcOffset` variable would cause the `utcOffsetStr` property to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
