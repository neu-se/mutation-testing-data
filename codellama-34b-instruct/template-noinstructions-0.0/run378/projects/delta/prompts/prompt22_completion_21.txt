  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would invert the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `diff` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is not a valid function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual(a, b)` would compare the values of `a` and `b` directly, rather than using the `isEqual` function, which could result in different behavior if the values are not equal.

DONE.
