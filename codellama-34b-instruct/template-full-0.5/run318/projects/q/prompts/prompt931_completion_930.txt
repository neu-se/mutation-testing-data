  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nodeify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nodeify` and `Q.denodeify` are different functions, and using the wrong one could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` and `Q.denodeify` are different functions, and using the wrong one could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfbind` and `Q.denodeify` are different functions, and using the wrong one could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
