  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `1 + b * b`, which would result in a positive value, while the new code fragment uses `1 - b * b`, which would result in a negative value. This change would cause the `hypot` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
