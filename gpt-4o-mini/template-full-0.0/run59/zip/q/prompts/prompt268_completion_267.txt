Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill the promise with the reason instead of rejecting it, leading to a successful resolution instead of an error state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a null value instead of rejecting it, which could lead to unexpected behavior in promise chains that expect a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject("Error occurred"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a static error message instead of the dynamic `reason` provided, potentially obscuring the actual error that occurred.

DONE.
