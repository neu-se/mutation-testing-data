  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 3.14
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of λ2 is used twice in the formula, but adding 3.14 to it would change the second usage of λ2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of λ2 is used twice in the formula, but negating it would change the second usage of λ2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of λ2 is used twice in the formula, but multiplying it by 2 would change the second usage of λ2.

DONE.
