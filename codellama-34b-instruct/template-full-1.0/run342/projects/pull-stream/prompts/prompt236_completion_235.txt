  Sure, here are three mutations for the provided code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the test function would never be called if the loop variable is set to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the test function would try to call a null object, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the test function would be called with argument 2 instead of the expected argument 1.

DONE.
