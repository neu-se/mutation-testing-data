  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value of the "head" property from the promise returned by `ends.promise.get("head")`, while the modified code fragment retrieves the value of the "tail" property from the promise returned by `ends.promise.get("tail")`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").then(function(value) {
  return value.tail;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value of the "head" property from the promise returned by `ends.promise.get("head")`, while the modified code fragment retrieves the value of the "tail" property from the promise returned by `ends.promise.get("head").then(function(value) { return value.tail; })`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.
