  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` is a function that removes the key and value from the database, whereas `delete` is a JavaScript operator that removes a property from an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the key to `undefined` instead of deleting the key and value from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._data[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the key and value from the `this._data` object, whereas `rm` is a function that removes the key and value from the database.

DONE.
