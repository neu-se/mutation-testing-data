  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(1, 0).divide(this['re']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `divide()` method is being called on a `Complex` instance with the argument `this['re']`, which is an `number`, so it would be equivalent to calling `1 / this['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(1, 0).multiply(this['re']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `multiply()` method is being called on a `Complex` instance with the argument `this['re']`, which is an `number`, so it would be equivalent to calling `1 * this['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['im'], 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor is being called with the arguments `this['im']` and `0`, so it would create
