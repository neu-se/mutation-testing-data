  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "goose" is also "goose", so the rule would return the same word instead of "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "goose" is "gooses", so the rule would return a different word instead of "geese".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule would return the same word instead of "geese".

DONE.
