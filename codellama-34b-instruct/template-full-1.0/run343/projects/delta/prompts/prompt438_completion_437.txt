  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would mistakenly consider a non-null object as a valid "retain" operation, when it should be considered an invalid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(nextOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a string that can be parsed as a number as a valid "retain" operation, when it should be considered an invalid operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a string as a valid "retain" operation, when it should be considered an invalid operation.

DONE.
