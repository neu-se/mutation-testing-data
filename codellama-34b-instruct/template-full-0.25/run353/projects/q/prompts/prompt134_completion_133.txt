  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while the modified code fragment is checking for equality with an incremented value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while the modified code fragment is checking for equality with a decremented value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while the modified code fragment is checking for equality with a doubled value.

DONE.
