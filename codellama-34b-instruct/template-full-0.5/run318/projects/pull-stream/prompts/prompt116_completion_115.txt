  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is a different value than `acc`, and it would not be passed as an argument to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` is a different value than `err`, and it would not be passed as an argument to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `err` and `acc`, and it would not be passed as an argument to the callback function.

DONE.
