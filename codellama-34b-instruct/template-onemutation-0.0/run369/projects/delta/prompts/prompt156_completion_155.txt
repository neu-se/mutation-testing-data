  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator, which may not be the same as the length of the current operation in the `this` iterator.

DONE.
