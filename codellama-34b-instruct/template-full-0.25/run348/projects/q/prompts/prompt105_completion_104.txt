  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array and also cause the loop to iterate twice as fast.

DONE.
