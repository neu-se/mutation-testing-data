  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the delta, potentially changing the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first operation from the delta, potentially changing the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the delta and reverse the order of the remaining operations, potentially changing the resulting delta.

DONE.
