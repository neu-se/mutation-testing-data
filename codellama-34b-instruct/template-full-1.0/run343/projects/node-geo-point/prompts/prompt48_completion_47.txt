  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = Math.tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the inverse tangent function to calculate φ2, while the new code uses the tangent function to calculate φ2. This would cause the calculation of φ2 to be incorrect, leading to errors in the subsequent calculations of y and x.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the sine function to calculate φ2, while the new code uses the cosine function to calculate φ2. This would cause the calculation of φ2 to be incorrect, leading to errors in the subsequent calculations of y and x.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = φ1 + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the inverse tangent function to calculate φ2, while the new code adds π
