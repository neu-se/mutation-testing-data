  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `loop` variable, causing the loop to run indefinitely even if `read` returns `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the `loop` variable, causing the loop to run one extra iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator subtracts 1 from the `loop` variable, causing the loop to run one fewer iteration.

DONE.
