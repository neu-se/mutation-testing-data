  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `thisIter` iterator onto the `delta` object, rather than the next operation from the `otherIter` iterator as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `otherIter` iterator onto the `delta` object, rather than the next operation from the `thisIter` iterator as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the `delta` object, rather than an operation as in the original code.

DONE.
