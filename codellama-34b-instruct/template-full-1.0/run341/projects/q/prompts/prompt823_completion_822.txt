  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 console.log("Error!")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error message would be logged to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 throw new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message would be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved.

DONE.
