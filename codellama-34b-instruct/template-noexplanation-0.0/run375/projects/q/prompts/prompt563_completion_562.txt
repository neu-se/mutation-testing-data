  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This will cause the `Q.return` function to return the exception object itself, rather than the `value` property of the exception. This may cause the code to behave differently, as the exception object may have different properties and methods than the `value` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This will cause the `Q.return` function to return the message property of the exception object, rather than the `value` property. This may cause the code to behave differently, as the message property may have different values and meanings than the `value` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This will cause the `Q.return` function to return the stack property of the exception object, rather than the `value` property. This may cause the code to behave differently, as the stack property may have different values and meanings than the `value` property.

DONE.
