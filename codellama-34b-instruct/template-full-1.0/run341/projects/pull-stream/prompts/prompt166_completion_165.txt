  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the existence of a variable called `cb` in the enclosing scope, whereas `null` is a primitive value that is not a function and does not have a `cb` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function and does not have a `cb` property, whereas the original code fragment is checking for the existence of a variable called `cb` in the enclosing scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'foo'` is a string primitive value and does not have a `cb` property, whereas the original code fragment is checking for the existence of a variable called `cb` in the enclosing scope.

DONE.
