  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack counter to be initialized to a maximum value instead of a minimum value, which could lead to incorrect stack trace filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack counter to be initialized to a random value instead of a minimum value, which could lead to incorrect stack trace filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack counter to be initialized to a value that is one greater than the minimum value, which could lead to incorrect stack trace filtering.

DONE.
