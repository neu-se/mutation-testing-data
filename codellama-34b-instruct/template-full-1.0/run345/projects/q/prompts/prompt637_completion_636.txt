  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because "remove" is not a valid property name for a promise object, and it will throw an error when the dispatch method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"_"
```
This would result in different behavior because "+" is a valid property name for a promise object, but it refers to the concatenation method, not the delete method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del" + "ete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "del" is not a valid keyword in JavaScript, and "delete" is a reserved word that cannot be used as a property name.

DONE.
