  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `newException` object would be used as the rejection reason, rather than the `newException` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `newException` object would be used as the rejection reason, rather than the `newException` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `newException` object would be used to generate a string representation of the rejection reason, rather than using the `newException` object itself.

DONE.
