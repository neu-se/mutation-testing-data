  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` returns the hostname without the port number, while `ret.host` returns the hostname with the port number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.protocol` returns the protocol used for the URL, while `ret.host` returns the hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.pathname` returns the pathname of the URL, while `ret.host` returns the hostname.

DONE.
