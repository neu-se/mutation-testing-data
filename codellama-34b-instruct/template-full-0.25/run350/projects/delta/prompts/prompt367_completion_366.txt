  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be
