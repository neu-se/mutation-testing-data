  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.allResolved = Promise.prototype.allSettled;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of promises instead of a promise for an array of promises that are all fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.allResolved = function () {
    return this.then(function() {

This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of promises that are all fulfilled or rejected instead of a promise for an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.allResolved = function () {
    return this.all().then(function() {
        return promises;
