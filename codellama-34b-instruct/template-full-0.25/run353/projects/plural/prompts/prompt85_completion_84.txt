  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "mouse" to the list of exceptions, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "mouse" to the list of exceptions, while this new code fragment would add the plural form "mouses" to the list of exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "mouse" to the list of exceptions, while this new code fragment would add the plural form "mouses" to the list of exceptions.

DONE.
