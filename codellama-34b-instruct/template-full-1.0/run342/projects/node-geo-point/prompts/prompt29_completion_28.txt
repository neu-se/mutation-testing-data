  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the bearing to be based on the longitude instead of the latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the bearing to be based on the longitude of the starting point instead of the ending point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random() > 0.5 ? point2.latitude : point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose the latitude or longitude of the ending point when calculating the bearing.

DONE.
