  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the matched string with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces it with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the matched string with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces it with the string "default".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default\.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the matched string with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces it with the string "default\.[a-z]+$".

DONE.
