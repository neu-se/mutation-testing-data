  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if the `try` block did not throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `!threw` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, even if the `try` block did throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw === true` is only true if `threw` is true, but not if it's false or undefined.

DONE.
