 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "remove" does not have the same meaning as "delete" and might not be recognized by the dispatch method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.del
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the Q.del function directly, instead of using the property accessor syntax.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.del
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the del method on the current object, rather than passing "delete" as a string to the dispatch method.

DONE.
