  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passed as an argument to the `buildTimezone` function, which expects a valid object. If `null` is passed instead, the function will likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passed as an argument to the `buildTimezone` function, which expects a valid object. If an empty object is passed instead, the function may not generate the expected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ country: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passed as an argument to the `buildTimezone` function, which expects a valid object. If an object with a `null` property is passed instead, the function may not generate the expected results.

DONE.
