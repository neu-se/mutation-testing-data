  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this code checks if `mapper` is null. If `mapper` is null, the original code would return `id`, while this code would return `mapper(data)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this code checks if `mapper` is undefined. If `mapper` is undefined, the original code would return `id`, while this code would return `mapper(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this code checks if `mapper` has a length of 0. If `mapper` has a length of 0,
