  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.return(foo + bar);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.return` function is not defined in the original code, and would cause a runtime error if it were used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return foo + bar;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the generator function to return immediately, rather than waiting for the promises to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread([foo, bar], function (foo, bar) {
    return foo + bar;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.spread` function is not defined in the original code, and would cause a runtime error if it were used.

DONE.
