  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<UNPREDICTABLE>"
```
This would result in different behavior because `<UNPREDICTABLE>` is a random string that is not a valid file path, and therefore would cause the `access()` function to fail with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<INVALID_PATH>"
```
This would result in different behavior because `<INVALID_PATH>` is a path that is not a valid file path, and therefore would cause the `access()` function to fail with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<customWriteStream(targetFilePath)>"
```
This would result in different behavior because `<customWriteStream(targetFilePath)>` is a function call that returns a custom write stream, which may have different behavior than the original `fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath)` call.

DONE.
