 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat.apply([], ref.slice(0, 4))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array using `concat` and `slice` instead of directly passing the first four elements of the `ref` array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the original array reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(0, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new array with the first four elements of the `ref` array, but does not pass it as arguments to the `pull` function. This would cause the `pull` function to behave differently as it would not receive the arguments as separate parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.map(function(e) { return e; }).slice(0, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array using `map` and then slices the first
