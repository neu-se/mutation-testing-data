  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been removed, causing the condition to be inverted. If `end` is truthy, the `test(data)` function will be called, even if `data` does not match the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been removed from `end`, causing the condition to be inverted. If `end` is falsy, the `test(data)` function will be called, even if `data` does not match the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been added to `test(data)`, causing the condition to be inverted. If `end` is truthy and `data` does not match the expected value, the
