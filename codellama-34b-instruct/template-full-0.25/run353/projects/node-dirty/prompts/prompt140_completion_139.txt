  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an `'error'` event only if the callback function has no arguments, while the new code fragment would emit an `'error'` event regardless of the number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Custom error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an `'error'` event with a custom error message, while the new code fragment would emit an `'error'` event with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an `'error'` event with the original error object, while the new code fragment would emit an `'error'` event with a different error object.

DONE.
