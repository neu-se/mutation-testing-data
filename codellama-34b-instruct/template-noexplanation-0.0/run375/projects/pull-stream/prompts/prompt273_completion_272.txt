  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to always return `true`, even if `stream` is not a function, which will result in the `nextChunk` function being called with an invalid `stream` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream !== null
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to always return `true`, even if `stream` is `null`, which will result in the `nextChunk` function being called with an invalid `stream` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream !== 'function'
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to always return `true`, even if `stream` is not a function, which will result in the `nextChunk` function being called with an invalid `stream` argument.

DONE.
