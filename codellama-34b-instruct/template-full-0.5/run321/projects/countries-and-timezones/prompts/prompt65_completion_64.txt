  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `null` to the `countries` object at key `id`, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign an empty object to the `countries` object at key `id`, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { id: 'invalid' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign an object with a different `id` property to the `countries` object at key `id`, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object instead of the expected one.

DONE.
