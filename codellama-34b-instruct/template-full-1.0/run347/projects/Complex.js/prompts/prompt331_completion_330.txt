  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a > 0` will only return `true` if `a` is greater than zero, whereas `a === 0` will return `true` if `a` is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== 0` will only return `true` if `b` is not equal to zero, whereas `a === 0` will return `true` if `a` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== 0 && b !== 0` will only return `true` if both `a` and `b` are not equal to zero, whereas `a === 0` will return `true` if `a` is equal to zero, regardless of the value of `
