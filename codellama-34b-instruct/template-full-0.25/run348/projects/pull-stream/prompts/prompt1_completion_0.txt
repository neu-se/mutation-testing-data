  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, but the loop would never execute because the loop condition `k in sources` would always be false since `k` is initialized to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, but the loop would never execute because the loop condition `k in sources` would always be false since `k` is a string and not a key in the `sources` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, but the loop would never execute because the loop condition `k in sources` would always be false since `k` is null
