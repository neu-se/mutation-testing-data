  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes()`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.includes()` method checks if a value is contained within a string, while the original code fragment uses the `.test()` method to check if a regular expression matches a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.match()` method checks if a regular expression matches a string, while the original code fragment uses the `.test()` method to check if a regular expression matches a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.indexOf()` method returns the index within a string of the first occurrence of a specified value, while the original code fragment uses the `.test()` method to check if a regular expression matches a string.

DONE.
