 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval(Object.keys)
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` can execute arbitrary code, which can lead to unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` returns a string representation of the function, not the actual function, which will cause a TypeError when executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.valueOf(Object.keys)
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` returns the primitive value of the object, which is not a function, causing a TypeError when executed.

DONE.
