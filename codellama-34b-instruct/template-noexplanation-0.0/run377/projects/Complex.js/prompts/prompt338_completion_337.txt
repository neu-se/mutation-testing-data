  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, a
```
This change will cause the `atan` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, 0
```
This change will cause the `acot` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This change will cause the `asec` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

DONE.
