  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would not be added to the `String` prototype if the condition is not met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would not be added to the `String` prototype if the condition is not met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === 'plural'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would not be added to the `String` prototype if the condition is not met.

DONE.
