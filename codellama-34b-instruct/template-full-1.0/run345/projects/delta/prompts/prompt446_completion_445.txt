  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 100` would change the return value of `Op.length` by adding 100 to it, which could cause the `if` statement that uses the result of `Op.length` to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 100` would change the return value of `Op.length` by subtracting 100 from it, which could cause the `if` statement that uses the result of `Op.length` to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the return value of `Op.length` by multiplying it by 2, which could cause the `if` statement that uses the result of `
