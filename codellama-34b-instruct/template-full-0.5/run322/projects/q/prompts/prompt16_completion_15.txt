  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the existence of `window` or `self`, but this new code fragment also checks for the existence of `global`, which may not exist in some environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of `window` or `self`, but this new code fragment checks for the existence of both `window` and `self`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || typeof document !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the existence of `window` or `self`, but this new code fragment also checks for the existence
