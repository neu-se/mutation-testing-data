  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if the number is positive or negative infinity, while the `isZero` method checks if the number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the number is not a number, while the `isZero` method checks if the number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property returns the imaginary part of the number, while the `isZero` method checks if the number is zero.

DONE.
