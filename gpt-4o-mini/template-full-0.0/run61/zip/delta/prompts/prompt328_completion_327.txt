Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being pushed to the inverted Delta from the original operation to its attributes, which may not represent the intended operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the operation with a null value, effectively discarding the operation instead of inverting it, which could lead to loss of data in the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert + ' modified'
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the inserted content by appending a string, which changes the actual data being represented in the Delta, potentially leading to incorrect results in subsequent operations.

DONE.
