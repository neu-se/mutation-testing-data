  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the string has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the string has no non-whitespace characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the string contains an empty string.

DONE.
