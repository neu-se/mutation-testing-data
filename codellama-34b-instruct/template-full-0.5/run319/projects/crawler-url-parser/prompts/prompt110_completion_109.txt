  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear()` method removes all elements from the map, whereas the `delete()` method removes a specific key-value pair from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set()` method adds a new key-value pair to the map, whereas the `delete()` method removes a specific key-value pair from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete()` method removes a specific key-value pair from the map, whereas the `set()` method adds a new key-value pair to the map.

DONE.
