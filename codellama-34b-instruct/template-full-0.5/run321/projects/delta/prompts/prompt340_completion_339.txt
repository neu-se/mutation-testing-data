  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` in the original code would return the index of the next operation, while `baseIndex + 2` would return the index of the operation after that. This could cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the delta's operations, leading to different behavior in the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` in the original code would return the index of the next operation, while `baseIndex + 0` would return the current index. This could cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the delta's operations, leading to different behavior in the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior
