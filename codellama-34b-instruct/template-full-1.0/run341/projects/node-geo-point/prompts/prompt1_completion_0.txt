  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the variables are not numbers, while this code checks if the variables are null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 isNaN(latitude) || isNaN(longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the variables are not numbers, while this code checks if the variables are not a number or a string that can be converted to a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 !isFinite(latitude) || !isFinite(longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the variables are not numbers, while this code checks if the variables are not finite numbers.

DONE.
