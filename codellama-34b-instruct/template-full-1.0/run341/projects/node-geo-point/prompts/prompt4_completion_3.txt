  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property, whereas the original code checks if the property is present in the object's prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!point.coordinates` check would return `true` if the `coordinates` property is not defined, or if it is defined but has a falsy value (such as `null`, `undefined`, or `false`). In contrast, the original code would only return `true` if the `coordinates` property is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `coordinates` property is an array and has a length of 2, whereas this new code
