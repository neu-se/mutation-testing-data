  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different operation than "delete", and would cause the promise to resolve with the new value instead of deleting the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different operation than "delete", and would cause the promise to resolve with the current value of the property instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is a different operation than "delete", and would cause the promise to resolve with the return value of the method call instead of deleting the property.

DONE.
