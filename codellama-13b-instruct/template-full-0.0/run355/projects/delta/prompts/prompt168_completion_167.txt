  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 1 operation, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 2 operations, rather than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 3 operations, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
