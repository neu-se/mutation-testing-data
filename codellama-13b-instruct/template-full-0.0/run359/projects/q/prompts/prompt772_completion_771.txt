  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled(promises).then(function (results) {
    return results.filter(function (result) {
        return result.state === "fulfilled";
    }).map(function (result) {
        return result.value;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Q.allSettled` method to wait for all promises to settle, and then filters out the rejected promises and maps the fulfilled promises to their values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(promises).then(function (results) {
    return results.filter(function (result) {
        return result.state === "fulfilled";
    }).map(function (result) {
        return result.value;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Q.all` method to wait for all promises to be fulfilled, and then filters out the rejected promises and maps the fulfilled promises
