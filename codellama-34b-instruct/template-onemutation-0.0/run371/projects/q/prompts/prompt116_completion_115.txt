  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `index` variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code fragment uses `index + 1` to access the next element in the array. This would cause the `array_map` function to skip the first element in the array and process the remaining elements, potentially resulting in incorrect output.

DONE.
