  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peek length is less than or equal to `firstLeft`, while this replacement checks if it is strictly less than `firstLeft`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where the peek length is equal to `firstLeft`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peek length is less than or equal to `firstLeft`, while this replacement checks if it is greater than or equal to `firstLeft`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where the peek length is equal to `firstLeft`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
