  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that is used to indicate an "empty" or "undefined" value. In the context of the `then` method, `void 0` is used to indicate that the promise should be resolved with an "undefined" value, whereas `null` would be a valid value that could be used in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is used to indicate that a variable or property has not been assigned a value. In the context of the `then` method, `undefined` would be a valid value that could be used in the promise chain, whereas `void 0` is a special value that is used to indicate an "empty" or "undefined" value.
