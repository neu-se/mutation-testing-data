  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `atanh` is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, which has a different range and behavior than `cos`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, which has a different range and behavior than `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which has a different range and behavior than `cos`.

DONE.
