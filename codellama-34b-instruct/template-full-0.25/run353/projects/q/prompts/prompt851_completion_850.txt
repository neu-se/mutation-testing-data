  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, instead of rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would create a new rejected promise with the error object, instead of using the existing `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw error` would throw the error object as an exception, instead of rejecting the promise.

DONE.
