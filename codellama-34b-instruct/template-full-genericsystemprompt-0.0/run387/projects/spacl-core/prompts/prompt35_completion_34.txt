  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is removed, causing the parts to be processed in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called with a different argument, causing the wrong parts to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join()` method is called with a different argument, causing the parts to be joined in the wrong order.

DONE.
