  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the compute-distance formula would be calculating the distance between the longitude values instead of the latitude values, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula would be using the value of Math.PI as the latitude value, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula would be using the value of Math.atan(1) as the latitude value, which would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
