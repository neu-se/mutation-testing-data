  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush()()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_flush()` method is being called twice, which could lead to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush('random')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new string argument is being passed to the `_flush()` method, which may not be handled properly in the implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because a new arrow function is being passed as an argument to the `_flush()` method, which may not be handled properly in the implementation.

DONE.
