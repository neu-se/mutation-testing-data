  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is truthy or falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if the `deprecated` property of the `options` object is falsy, rather than returning the `options` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options : {...options, deprecated: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, rather than returning the original `options` object.

DONE.
