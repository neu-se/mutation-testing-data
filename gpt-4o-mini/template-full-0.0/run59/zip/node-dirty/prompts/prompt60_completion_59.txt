Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to destroy the write stream instead of the read stream, potentially leading to errors when trying to read from the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pause the read stream instead of destroying it, which would prevent any further data from being read, potentially causing data loss or incomplete loading of the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroySoon()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySoon()` is not a valid method for a readable stream, leading to a runtime error when trying to close the stream, instead of properly closing it.

DONE.
