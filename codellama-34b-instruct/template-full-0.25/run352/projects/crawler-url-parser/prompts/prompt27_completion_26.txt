  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes('://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with a protocol, while this replacement checks if the string contains a protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with a protocol, while this replacement checks if the string starts with the HTTP protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.endsWith('://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with a protocol, while this replacement checks if the string ends with a protocol.

DONE.
