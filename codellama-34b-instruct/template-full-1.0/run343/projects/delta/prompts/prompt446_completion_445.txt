  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length()` is a method that returns the length of an `Op` object, while `Op.length` is a property that contains the length of an `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.size` is a property that contains the size of an `Op` object, while `Op.length` is a property that contains the length of an `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length - 1` would always return `0` if the `Op` object has a length of `1`, while `Op.length` would return the actual length of the `Op` object.

DONE.
