  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `message` property, unlike the original `exception` object which is an instance of the `Error` class and has a `message` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `message` property, unlike the original `exception` object which is an instance of the `Error` class and has a `message` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new instance of the `Error` class, which has a `message` property, unlike the original `exception` object which is an instance of the `Error` class and has a `message` property.

DONE.
