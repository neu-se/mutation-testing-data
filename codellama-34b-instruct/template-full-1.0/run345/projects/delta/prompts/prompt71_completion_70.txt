  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(attributes as PLACEHOLDER).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `attributes` object as an array, while the original code fragment returns the length of the `attributes` object as a plain object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(attributes as PLACEHOLDER).size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the size of the `attributes` object as a map, while the original code fragment returns the length of the `attributes` object as a plain object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(attributes as PLACEHOLDER).count
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of items in the `attributes` object as a list, while the original code fragment returns the length of the `attributes` object as a plain object.

DONE.
