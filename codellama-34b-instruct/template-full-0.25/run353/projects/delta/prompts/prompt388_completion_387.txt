  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `length` is an object. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `otherIter.peekLength()` returns a different number each time it is called. This would cause the function to behave differently each time it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `thisIter.peekLength()` returns a different number each time it is called. This would cause the function to behave differently each time it is called.
