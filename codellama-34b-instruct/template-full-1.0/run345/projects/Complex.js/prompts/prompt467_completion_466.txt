  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to zero, whereas this modified code fragment checks whether `a` is falsey. If `a` is a boolean value, then this modification would cause the `toString()` method to output a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to zero using the strict equality operator `!==`, whereas this modified code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to zero using the non-strict equality operator `!=`. If `a` is a complex number with an imaginary part that is not zero, then this modification would cause the `toString()` method to output a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a--
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to zero, whereas
