Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pathToFilename(path) + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a trailing slash to the filename could potentially change how the file is opened or interpreted, especially if the file system or underlying operating system treats directories and files differently based on the presence of a trailing slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + pathToFilename(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a relative path prefix could change the directory from which the file is being accessed, potentially affecting the file's resolution or accessibility, especially in cases where the current working directory is not what the code expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.getResolvedLink(pathToFilename(path)).getNode().getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the original filename, it resolves the link to the actual file node and then uses the name of that node, which could be different in cases of symbolic links or other file system aliases, potentially affecting the file that gets opened.

DONE.
