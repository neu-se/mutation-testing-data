  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, args, op
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.concat(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being concatenated with the `object` value, which could cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `args` array is being removed, which could cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
