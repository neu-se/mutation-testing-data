  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++i < length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2 < length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would skip over every other element in the array, potentially skipping some intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would continue looping until the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array, potentially leading to infinite looping.

DONE.
