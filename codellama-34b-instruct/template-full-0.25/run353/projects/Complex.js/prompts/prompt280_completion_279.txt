  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the values of `a` and `b`, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` together, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` and `b` together, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
