  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the entry from the map, whereas `set` would update the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the first callback in the list, whereas the original code sets all callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the map, whereas the original code updates the values.

DONE.
