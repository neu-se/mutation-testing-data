  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not take any arguments, while this new code fragment takes an argument of 1. This would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with an argument, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not take any arguments, while this new code fragment takes an argument of `null`. This would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with an argument, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not take any arguments, while this new code fragment takes an argument of `undefined`. This would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with an argument, which could potentially cause it to behave differently
