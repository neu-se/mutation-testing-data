  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the + 1 would cause the result of the query method to always be truthy, even if the query method returned a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the - 1 would cause the result of the query method to always be falsy, even if the query method returned a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the * 2 would cause the result of the query method to always be multiplied by 2, potentially causing different behavior for certain inputs.

DONE.
