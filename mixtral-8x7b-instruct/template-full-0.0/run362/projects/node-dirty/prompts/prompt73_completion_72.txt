 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a different error code, which would not be equivalent to the original condition checking for 'ENOENT'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message.includes('ENOENT')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the error message contains the string 'ENOENT', rather than checking if the error code is equal to 'ENOENT'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Error && err.code === 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if err is an instance of Error and if its code is equal to 'ENOENT', which is more specific than the original condition.

DONE.
