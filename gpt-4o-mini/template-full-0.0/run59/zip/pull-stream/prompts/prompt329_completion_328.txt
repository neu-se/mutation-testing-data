Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of applying the operation `op` to the data, it logs the data to the console, which does not modify or process the data as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the data by adding 1 to it before passing it to `op`, which changes the output of the operation and may lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` to `op` instead of the actual `data`, which could lead to errors or unintended behavior if `op` is not designed to handle `null` values.

DONE.
