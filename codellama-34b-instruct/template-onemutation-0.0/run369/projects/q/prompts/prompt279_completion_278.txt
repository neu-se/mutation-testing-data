  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which will include the second argument of the `makeNodeResolver` function in the resulting array, whereas the original code fragment did not include the second argument.
