  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` and `getCountry` have different parameters and return types, so the mutated code would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountriesForTimezone` takes a timezone name as its parameter, whereas `getCountry` takes a country ID as its parameter. The mutated code would not be able to handle the same input as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is a completely different function from `getCountry`. The mutated code would not be equivalent to the original code and would not be able to handle the same input.

DONE.
