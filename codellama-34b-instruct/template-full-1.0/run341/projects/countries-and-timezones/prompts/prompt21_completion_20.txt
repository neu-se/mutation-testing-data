  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Number.isInteger` to check if `tz.d` is an integer, while the replaced code uses `1 - tz.d` which would always result in a number that is not an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Number.isInteger` to check if `tz.d` is an integer, while the replaced code uses `tz.d + 1` which would always result in a number that is not an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Number.isInteger` to check if `tz.d` is an integer, while the replaced code uses `tz.d * 2` which would always result in a number that is not an integer
