  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This code fragment sets the `Q.onerror` property to `null`, which will cause any errors that are thrown to be unhandled and propagate up the call stack. This behavior is different from the original code, which called the `Q.onerror` function if it existed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This code fragment sets the `Q.onerror` property to an empty function, which will cause any errors that are thrown to be silently ignored. This behavior is different from the original code, which called the `Q.onerror` function if it existed.

```
Q.onerror = function (error) { throw error; };
```
This code fragment sets the `Q.onerror` property to a function that throws the error that is passed to it. This behavior is different from the original code, which called the `Q
