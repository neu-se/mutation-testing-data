 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be overwritten, and the original error handling behavior would be lost.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nextTick.bind(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be replaced with the `nextTick` method bound to the `Q` object, causing the error to be forwarded to the next tick in a different manner.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (error) { throw error; }
