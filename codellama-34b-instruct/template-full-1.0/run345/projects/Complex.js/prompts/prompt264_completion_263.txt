  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not a valid argument for the `Math.atan2()` function, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a variable that is not used in the original code, and would not affect the outcome of the `atan` calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the `a` argument, which would change the result of the `atan` calculation.

DONE.
