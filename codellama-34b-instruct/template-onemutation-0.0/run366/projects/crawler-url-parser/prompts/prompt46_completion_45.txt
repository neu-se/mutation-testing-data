  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, while `URL.format` returns a string. In the original code, the `parsedUrl` variable is assigned the result of `URL.parse`, and then `URL.format` is called on `parsedUrl`. If `URL.parse` is replaced with `URL.format`, the `parsedUrl` variable would be assigned a string, which would cause an error when `URL.format` is called on it.
