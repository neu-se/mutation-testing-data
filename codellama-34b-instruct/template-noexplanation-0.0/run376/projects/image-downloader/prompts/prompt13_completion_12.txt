  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This code fragment is similar to the original `decodeURIComponent` but it only decodes the URI and does not decode the component. This could cause issues if the URI contains encoded characters that are not decoded properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This code fragment is the opposite of `decodeURIComponent` and it encodes the URI component instead of decoding it. This could cause issues if the URI component is not properly encoded before being sent to the server.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This code fragment first decodes the URI component using `decodeURIComponent` and then converts the result to lowercase using `toLowerCase()`. This could cause issues if the URI component contains uppercase characters that are not properly decoded or if the lowercase conversion is not properly handled by the server.

DONE.
