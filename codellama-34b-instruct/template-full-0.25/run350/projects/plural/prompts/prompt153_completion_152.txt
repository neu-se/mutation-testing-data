  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length, num
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` would return the length of the string, whereas `this` would return the string itself, which could lead to different results when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `num` and `this` are swapped, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `num + 1` would increase the value of `num` by 1, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
