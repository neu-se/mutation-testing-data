  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` being `false` would prevent the `rejected` callback from being called, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` being `true` would cause the `rejected` callback to be called immediately, regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` being not equal to `true` would cause the `rejected` callback to be called if the promise is resolved, but not if it is rejected.

DONE.
