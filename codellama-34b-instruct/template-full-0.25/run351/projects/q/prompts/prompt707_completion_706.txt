  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to slice the `arguments` object from the first element to the end, while this replacement code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the second element to the end, which would result in a different array of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to slice the `arguments` object from the first element to the end, while this replacement code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the first element to the second element, which would result in a different array of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in
