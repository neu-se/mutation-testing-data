  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("This is a bug");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return "This is a bug";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the string "This is a bug", whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("This is a bug");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the string "This is a bug", whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.
