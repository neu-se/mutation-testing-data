  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call(newPromise, ...message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `newPromise` object as the `this` value for the `promiseDispatch` method, which may not be the intended behavior if the method is not designed to be called in that way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.forEach(function(arg) {
    newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, arg);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the `message` array and apply each element to the `promiseDispatch` method, which may not be the desired behavior if the method is not designed to be called multiple times with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, message.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `prom
