  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because `busy` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if `busy` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because `!busy` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, even if `busy` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `busy === true` is only `true` if `busy` is `true`, so the `if` statement would only be executed if `busy` is `true`.

DONE.
