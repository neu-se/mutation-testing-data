 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method would not be called, and instead, `null` would be passed to the `if` statement. This would cause a runtime error when attempting to access properties or methods on the `null` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<any_invalid_variable_name>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw a `ReferenceError` as the variable `<any_invalid_variable_name>` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed instead of the `Delta.getHandler` method. The `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, and the code inside the block would not be executed.

DONE.
