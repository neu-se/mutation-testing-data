  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key++` operation would increment the key value, which would not be present in the original `object_keys` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.nonExistent, key
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.nonExistent` is not a valid object property, so the return value of the `object_keys` method would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key - 1], key
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[key - 1]` would reference a different property than the original `object[key]` reference.

DONE.
