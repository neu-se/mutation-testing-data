  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`num * num`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square of the input number, instead of the input number itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`num + 1`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the input number plus 1, instead of the input number itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Math.random()`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number, instead of the input number itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
