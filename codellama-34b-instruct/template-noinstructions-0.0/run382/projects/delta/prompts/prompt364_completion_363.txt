  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert, while this replacement checks if the next operation is not an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation has a length greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the next operation has a length greater than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation has a length greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the next operation has a length less than 0.

DONE.
