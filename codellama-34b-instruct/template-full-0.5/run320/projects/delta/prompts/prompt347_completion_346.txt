  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation changes the value of the `baseOpData` variable, which is used to determine the length of the `slice` in the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation changes the value of the `baseOpData` variable, which is used to determine the length of the `slice` in the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation changes the value of the `baseOpData` variable, which is used to determine the length of the `slice` in the `invert` method.

DONE.
