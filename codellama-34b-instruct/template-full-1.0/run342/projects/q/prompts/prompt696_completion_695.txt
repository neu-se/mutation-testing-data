  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_reverse` function returns the array in reverse order, which could cause unexpected results in the `dispatch` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_length` function returns the length of the array, which could cause the `dispatch` function to access memory outside of the bounds of the array, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_sort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_sort` function returns a sorted copy of the array, which could cause the `dispatch` function to access the wrong elements in the array, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
