  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while the new code fragment only checks if `num` is not equal to 1. This means that if `num` is undefined, the original code fragment would return the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment would return the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while the new code fragment only checks if `num` is undefined. This means that if `num` is not equal to 1, the original code fragment would return the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment would return the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num !== undefined
```
This would result in different
