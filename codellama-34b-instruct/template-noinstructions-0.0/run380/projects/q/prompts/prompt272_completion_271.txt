  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressListener` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressListener` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressListener` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.nextTick`.

DONE.
