  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation, which may not be the same as the length of the next operation that would be returned by `next()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the same as the operation that would be returned by `next()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(1)` advances the iterator by one operation, which may not be the same as the operation that would be returned by `next()` without any arguments.

DONE.
