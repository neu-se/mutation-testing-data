 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would cause a division by zero error when b is 0, while the original code fragment would return Infinity for the 'im' property in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would negate the value of 'b', while the original code fragment simply uses its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would apply the sine function to 'b', while the original code fragment simply uses its value.

DONE.
