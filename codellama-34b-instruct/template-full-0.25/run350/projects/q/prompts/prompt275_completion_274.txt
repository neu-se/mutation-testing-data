  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `error` parameter, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `new Error()` constructor, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `reason` parameter, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

DONE.
