  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error event would trigger a warning event instead, which may not be handled by the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'otherError'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error event would trigger a different event, which may not be handled by the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error event would trigger the end event instead, which may not be handled by the application.

DONE.
