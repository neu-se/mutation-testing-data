  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the characters in the string.

DONE.
