  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This change will cause the `query` method to return `false` instead of `true` when the action is explicitly denied, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This change will cause the `query` method to return `true` instead of `false` when the action is explicitly denied, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This change will cause the `query` method to return `true` instead of `false` when the action is explicitly denied, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

DONE.
