  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `messages` array instead of checking if it's defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the first element of the `messages` array instead of checking if it's defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is resolved instead of checking if the `messages` array is defined.

DONE.
