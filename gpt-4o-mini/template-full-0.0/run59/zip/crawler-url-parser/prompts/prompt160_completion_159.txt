Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `g` (global) flag would cause the replacement to occur for all matches in the string, rather than just the last match, potentially altering the path in unexpected ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the matched substring with a space instead of an empty string would leave a space at the end of the path, which could affect subsequent URL processing and comparisons.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/index.html"
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the matched substring with "/index.html" would change the path to always end with "index.html", which could lead to incorrect URL type classifications and misinterpretations of the URL structure.

DONE.
