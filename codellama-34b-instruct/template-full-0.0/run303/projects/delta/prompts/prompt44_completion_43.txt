  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `null` and `undefined`, while this new code fragment only checks for `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `null` and `undefined`, while this new code fragment only checks for `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `null` and `undefined`, while this new code fragment only checks for `undefined`.

DONE.
