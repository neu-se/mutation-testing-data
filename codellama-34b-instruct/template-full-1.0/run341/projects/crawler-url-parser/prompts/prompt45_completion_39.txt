  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would be resolved using the `URL.resolve()` method with the `parsedBaseUrl` object, but without the `parsedUrl.search` property (as the second argument is set to `false`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would be resolved using the `URL.resolve()` method with the `parsedBaseUrl` object, but without the `parsedUrl.hash` property (as the third argument is set to `false`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called on the `baseUrlStr` string directly, which may produce different results than resolving the `baseUrlStr` using the `
