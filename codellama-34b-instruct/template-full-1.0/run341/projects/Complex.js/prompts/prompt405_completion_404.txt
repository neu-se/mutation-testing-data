  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'], x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `x['im']` and `x['re']` are backwards from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would return the sum of `x['re']` and `x['im']`, which could be a different value than `x['re']` and `x['im']` separated by a comma.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] * x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would return the product of `x['re']` and `x['im']`, which could be a different value than `x['re']` and `x['im']` separated by a comma.

DONE.
