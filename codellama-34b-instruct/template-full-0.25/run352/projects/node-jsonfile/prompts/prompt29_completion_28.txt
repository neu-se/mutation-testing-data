  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'buggy'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional string `'buggy'` would be included in the output, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the number `1` would be added to the output, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'null'` would be included in the output, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
