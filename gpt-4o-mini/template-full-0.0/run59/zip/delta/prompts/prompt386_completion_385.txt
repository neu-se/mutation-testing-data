Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always take the maximum length between the two operations instead of the minimum, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when one operation is longer than the other.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the length of the current operation, which could cause an out-of-bounds error or incorrect handling of the operations if the length exceeds the actual available length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length by 1, which could lead to incorrect transformations or loss of data if the length is already 1, resulting in an attempt to process an operation that doesn't exist.

DONE.
