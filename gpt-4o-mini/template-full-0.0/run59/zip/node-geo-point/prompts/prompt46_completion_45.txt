Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly converts radians to degrees instead of degrees to radians, leading to incorrect calculations for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the longitude of `point1` instead of the latitude, which would yield an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the latitude conversion with a constant value of 0, effectively ignoring the actual latitude of `point1` and resulting in an incorrect bearing calculation.

DONE.
