 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would no longer close file streams, causing potential resource leaks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = this._load;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would now call the `_load` method, which is not its intended purpose. This could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to close the connection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = (x) => this.close(x, () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would now expect an additional argument, which is not how it was designed to be used. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior when attempting to close the connection.

DONE.
