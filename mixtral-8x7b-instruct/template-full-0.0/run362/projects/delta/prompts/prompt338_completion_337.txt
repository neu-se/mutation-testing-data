 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the current iterator instead of the base index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start from the beginning of the delta, potentially causing incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' ? thisIter.peekLength() : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next insert operation or 0 if the next operation is not an insert, which could lead to incorrect transformations.

DONE.
