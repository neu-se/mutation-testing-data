  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message = ("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all " +
    "promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be overwritten with a new message that includes the previous error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message = ("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all " +
    "promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message + " " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be overwritten with a new message that includes the previous error message twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message = ("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all " +
    "promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message + " " +
