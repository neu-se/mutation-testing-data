Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([*+])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the `*` and `+` characters instead of the `.` and `$`, which are not the intended characters to be escaped in the regex, potentially leading to incorrect path matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([a-zA-Z])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape all alphabetic characters instead of just the special characters `.` and `$`, which would alter the intended functionality of the regex and could lead to unexpected matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([0-9])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape numeric characters instead of the special characters `.` and `$`, which would not only change the regex's purpose but also likely cause it to fail to match valid paths that include those special characters.

DONE.
