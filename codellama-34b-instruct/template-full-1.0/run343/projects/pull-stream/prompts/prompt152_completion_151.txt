  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function with one argument, but this replacement code fragment calls it with two arguments, which could cause the `cb` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function with one argument, but this replacement code fragment calls it with two arguments, and the first argument is a boolean value, which could cause the `cb` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function with one argument, but this replacement code fragment calls it with two arguments, and the first argument is the `abort` variable, which could cause the `cb` function to behave
