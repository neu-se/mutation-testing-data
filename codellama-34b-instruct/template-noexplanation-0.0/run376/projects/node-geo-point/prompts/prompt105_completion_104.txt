  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) + 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds 1 to the result, which will cause the `x` coordinate to be off by 1 tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) - 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it subtracts 1 from the result, which will cause the `x` coordinate to be off by -1 tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it multiplies the result by 2, which will cause the `x` coordinate to be
