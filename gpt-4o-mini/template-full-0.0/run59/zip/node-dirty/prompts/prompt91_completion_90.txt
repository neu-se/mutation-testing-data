Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event type emitted from an 'error' to a 'warning', which may not trigger the same error handling logic in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an 'info' event instead of an 'error', potentially leading to the application ignoring critical issues related to empty lines in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'critical'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the severity of the emitted event, which may alter how the application responds to the situation, possibly leading to inadequate error handling.

DONE.
