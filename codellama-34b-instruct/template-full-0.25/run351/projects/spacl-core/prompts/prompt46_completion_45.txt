  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string instead of just the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string and returning the first match, which may not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string and returning the length of the match, which may not be the same as the original behavior.

DONE.
