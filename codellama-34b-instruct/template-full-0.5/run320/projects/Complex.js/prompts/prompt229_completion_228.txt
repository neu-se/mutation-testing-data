  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of the hypotenuse, while this code calculates the square of the difference between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of the hypotenuse, while this code calculates the square of the ratio of the hypotenuse to the adjacent side.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of the hypotenuse, while this code calculates the square of the product of the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.

DONE.
