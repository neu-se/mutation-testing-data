Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + op + args
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from a dispatch call to a concatenation of the object, operation, and arguments, which is not a valid operation in this context and would likely lead to a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.op(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a method `op` on the `object`, which may not exist, leading to a TypeError if `op` is not a valid method of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `op` parameter entirely, which could lead to incorrect dispatching logic, potentially causing the wrong operation to be executed or resulting in an error due to missing parameters.

DONE.
