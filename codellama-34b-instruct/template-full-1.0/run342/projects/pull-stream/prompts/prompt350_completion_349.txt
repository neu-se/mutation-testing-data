  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a variable, and `prop.test` is a function that checks if `prop` is a JavaScript function. In the original code, the `prop` variable is not used, and the `id` function is returned instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id
```
This would result in different behavior because `id` is a function that always returns the argument it was given, whereas the original code uses the `prop` variable to determine the return value of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a variable, and `prop` is not a function that checks if `prop` is a JavaScript function. In the original code, the `prop` variable
