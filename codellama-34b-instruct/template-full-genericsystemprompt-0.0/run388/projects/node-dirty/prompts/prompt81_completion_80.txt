  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Buggy error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different from the original error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would be null instead of an instance of the Error class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would be undefined instead of an instance of the Error class.

DONE.
