  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not case-insensitive. The original code used the "i" flag to make the regular expression case-insensitive. Without this flag, the regular expression would only match words that end with "ics" in their original case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not case-insensitive. The original code used the "i" flag to make the regular expression case-insensitive. Without this flag, the regular expression would only match words that end with "ics" in their original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression includes the "i" flag, which makes it case-insensitive. The original code did not include this flag, which would cause the regular expression to only match words that end with
