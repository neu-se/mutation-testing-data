  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, but it is not a property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, but `call` is a method that calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, but `apply` is a method that calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

DONE.
