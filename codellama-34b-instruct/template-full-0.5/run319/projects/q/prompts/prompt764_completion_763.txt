  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` is a different method than `when()`, and it would not call the `when()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(null, null)` is a different method than `when()`, and it would not call the `when()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(function () {})` is a different method than `when()`, and it would not call the `when()` function.

DONE.
