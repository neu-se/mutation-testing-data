  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `array` is an array. This will result in the `array` being iterated over, even if it is not an array, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `array` is an empty array, which is not the intended behavior. This could cause the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `array` is not an empty array, which is not the intended behavior. This could cause the function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
