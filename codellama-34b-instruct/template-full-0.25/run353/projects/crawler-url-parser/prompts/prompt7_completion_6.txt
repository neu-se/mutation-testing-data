  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the code to behave as if the `baseUrlStr` did not have any illegal characters, even if it did.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value would be returned regardless of the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the code to behave as if the `baseUrlStr` did not have any illegal characters, even if it did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value would be
