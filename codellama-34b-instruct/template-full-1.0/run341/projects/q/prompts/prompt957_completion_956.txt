  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is not a function, and it would throw an error if it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is not a function, and it would throw an error if it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error('Failed to resolve'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the specified error message, which would trigger the promise's error handling logic.

DONE.
