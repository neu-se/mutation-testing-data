 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not called, and the `inspected` variable will be assigned `null`. The `inspected.state` check will throw a `TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
