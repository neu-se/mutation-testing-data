  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not return anything, which may cause errors in the code that uses the drain function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null instead of the expected done callback, which may cause errors or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the err argument instead of the expected done callback, which may cause errors or incorrect behavior.

DONE.
