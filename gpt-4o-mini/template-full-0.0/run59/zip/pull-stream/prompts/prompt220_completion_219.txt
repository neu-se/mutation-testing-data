Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `null` may lead to different handling of the result in the calling code, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the caller is checking for `null` specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning the `data` directly instead of `null` would change the output of the function, potentially leading to incorrect results if the caller expects a `null` value when there is no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because returning the `err` object instead of `null` would indicate an error condition to the caller, which may not be the intended behavior if the mapping operation was successful and there was no error.

DONE.
