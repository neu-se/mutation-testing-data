  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function used to explicitly resolve a promise with a value, whereas `reject` is used to explicitly reject a promise with a reason. Using `fulfill` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to resolve, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is used to create a new promise that resolves with a given value, while `error` is an object that is used to represent an error that occurs during the execution of a promise. Using `Q(error)` instead of `reject(error)` would cause the promise to resolve with the error object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return error
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is an object that is used to represent an error that
