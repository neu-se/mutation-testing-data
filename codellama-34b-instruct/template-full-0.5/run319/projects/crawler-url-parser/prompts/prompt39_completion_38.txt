  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'ftp:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also exclude URLs with the "ftp" protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also exclude URLs with a null host.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.pathname == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also exclude URLs with a null pathname.

DONE.
