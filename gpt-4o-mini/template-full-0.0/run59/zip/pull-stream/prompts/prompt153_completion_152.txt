Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the callback to be executed when `abort` is false instead of true, which changes the intended flow of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `abort` means that the callback will not be executed based on the abort condition, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the abort flag is intended to control the flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the abort condition to always be true, which would cause the abort callback to be executed regardless of the actual value of `abort`, effectively bypassing the normal logic of the function.

DONE.
