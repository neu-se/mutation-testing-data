  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the subtraction operator, while this replacement uses the addition operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the subtraction operator, while this replacement uses the multiplication operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start / index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the subtraction operator, while this replacement uses the division operator.

DONE.
