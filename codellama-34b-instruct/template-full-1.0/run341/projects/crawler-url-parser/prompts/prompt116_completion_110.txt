  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrlStr);
let urlMap = new Map();
urlMap.set(0, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` method is used to set a new entry in the map with the key `0` and the value `currentUrl`, which is an object containing information about the URL. However, the `forEach` method is used to iterate over the entries in the map, which would not work with this new entry because it has a key of `0`, which is not a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrlStr);
let urlMap = new Map();
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` method is used to set a new entry in the map with the key `currentUrl.url` and the value `currentUrl`, which is an object containing information about the URL. However, the `forEach
