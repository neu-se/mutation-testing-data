  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `deferred.dispatch()` instead of `this.dispatch()`, which would cause the function to call a different method that could have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `deferred.reject` as the failure callback instead of `this.reject`, which could cause the function to behave differently when a failure occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `deferred.resolve` as the failure callback instead of `this.reject`, which could cause the function to behave differently when a failure occurs.
