  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be assigned a value of `null` instead of the expected object with URL parts. This could cause errors in the code that relies on the `currentUrl` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = getdom();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getdom()` function is not defined in the code and would cause an error when called. This would cause the code to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(baseUrlStr).url;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function is not defined in the code and would cause an error when called. This would cause the code to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
