  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `0` as the first argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
