 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the length of the array is 0, it will throw a TypeError when trying to access the first value in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always use the first value in the array as the basis for reduction, even if the array is empty or contains null/undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_indexOf(value, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will use the indexOf method to find the value in the array, which may not work correctly if the array contains duplicate values.

DONE.
