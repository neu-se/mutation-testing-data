  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` quantifier matches zero or more characters, whereas the `+` quantifier matches one or more characters. This change would cause the regex to match zero or more characters after the colon, rather than one or more.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` character inside the character class negates the character class, so this regex would match any character except for a forward slash. This change would cause the regex to match any character except for a forward slash after the colon, rather than any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` quantifier matches one or more characters, whereas the `*` quantifier matches zero or more characters. This change would cause the regex to match one or more characters after the colon, rather than zero or more.
