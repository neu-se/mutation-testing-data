  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` would start from the second argument, which is the first argument passed to `Q.nfcall`. This would ignore the first argument and give different results in the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(object)
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, so the function would be called with `object` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result inifferent behavior because `undefined` is a valid value, and so the function would be called with a null argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
