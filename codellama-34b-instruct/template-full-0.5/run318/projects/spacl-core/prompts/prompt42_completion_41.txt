  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `part` refers to a string, and `part.slice(0, -1)` would return a substring of that string, excluding the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `part` refers to a string, and `part.length` would return the length of that string, which would be a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `part` refers to a string, and `part.charAt(0)` would return the first character of that string.

DONE.
