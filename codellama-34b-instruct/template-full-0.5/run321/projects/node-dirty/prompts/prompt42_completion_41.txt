  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid JSON value, so the `JSON.parse` method would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JSON value, but it would not be a valid key in the database, so the `this._data.set(key, val)` method would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid JSON value, so the `JSON.parse` method would throw an error.

DONE.
