  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not have the same side effects as the original `progressed` function.

DONE.
