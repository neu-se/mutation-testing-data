Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the input word to uppercase, which would not match any of the defined rules that are case-sensitive, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the function to always return the plural form by appending 's' to the word, regardless of the rules defined, thus ignoring any specific pluralization logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substring(0, word.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the word, which could lead to incorrect pluralization results, especially for words that require specific transformations based on their endings.

DONE.
