  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, beyond the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(index >= length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to not iterate at all.

DONE.
