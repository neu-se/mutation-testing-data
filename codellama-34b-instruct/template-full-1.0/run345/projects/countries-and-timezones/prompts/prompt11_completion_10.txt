  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of an object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of strings representing the keys of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object, whereas `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs of an object, whereas `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of an object.

DONE.
