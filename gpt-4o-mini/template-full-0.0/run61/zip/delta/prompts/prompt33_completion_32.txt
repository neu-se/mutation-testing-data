Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] || base[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow attributes to be set to `null` when they are equal to the base, which is not the intended logic of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude cases where the base attribute is `null`, leading to potential loss of attributes that should be retained when they are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === undefined || base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow attributes to be set to `null` if they are `undefined` in `attr`, which changes the logic of how attributes are inverted compared to the original implementation.

DONE.
