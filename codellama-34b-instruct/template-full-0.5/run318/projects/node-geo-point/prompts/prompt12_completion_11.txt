  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true when the type is 'Point', instead of false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.type !== 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also return false when the type is 'LineString', instead of only when it's 'Point'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check the length of the coordinates array, instead of only the type.

DONE.
