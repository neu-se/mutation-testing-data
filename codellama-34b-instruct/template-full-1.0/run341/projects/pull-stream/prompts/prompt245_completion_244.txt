  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err && !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the truthiness of the `err` and `abort` variables, causing the conditional to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `||` operator would short-circuit and return `abort`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `? :` ternary operator would evaluate `err` and return `abort` if it is truthy, or `null` if it is falsy. This would cause the code to behave differently in the event that `err` is not a boolean value.

DONE.
