  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.cos()` function, but this replacement would use the `Math.cosh()` function instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `b` variable, but this replacement would add the `a` variable to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.cos()` function, but this replacement would use the `Math.sin()` function instead.

DONE.
