  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` refers to the first argument of the `nextChunk` function, which is the error object or null, whereas `err === true` tests whether the error object is equal to true, which is a different condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the `err` condition, i.e., if `err` is truthy, then `!err` is falsy, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it tests whether the `err` object has a `message` property and is truthy, whereas `err === true` tests whether the `err` object is equal to true.

DONE.
