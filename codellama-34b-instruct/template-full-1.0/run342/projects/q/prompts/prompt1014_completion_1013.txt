  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function call that returns a node resolver object, whereas `null` is a null value that would not resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function call that returns a node resolver object, whereas `undefined` is an undefined value that would not resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function call that returns a node resolver object, whereas `function () {}` is an empty function that would not resolve the promise.

DONE.
