  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with different code fragments that could result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because !end would always return the opposite of end, so the data would be transformed even if the stream was closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the data would always be transformed to 1, regardless of the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because mapper would always be called with the data, regardless of whether the stream was closed.

DONE.
