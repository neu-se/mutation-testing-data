  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `stringify` function called on `obj` would produce a JSON string, but calling it on `null` would produce the string `"null"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value. The `stringify` function called on `obj` would produce a JSON string, but calling it on `undefined` would produce the string `"undefined"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object. The `stringify` function called on `obj` would produce a JSON string, but calling it on `{}` would produce an empty JSON object.

DONE.
