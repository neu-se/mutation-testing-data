  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be off by 1, leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result to be off by 1, leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be double the original value, leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
