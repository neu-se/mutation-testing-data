  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.field
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object instead of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof key
```
This would result in different behavior because this would return the type of the `key` variable instead of the `key` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this would add 1 to the `key` variable instead of passing it directly.

DONE.
