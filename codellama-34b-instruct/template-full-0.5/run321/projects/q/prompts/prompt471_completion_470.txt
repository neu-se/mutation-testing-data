  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at + 1], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` variable would be offset by 1, leading to a different reason being reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at - 1], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` variable would be offset by -1, leading to a different reason being reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at + 2], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` variable would be offset by 2, leading to a different reason being reported.

DONE.
