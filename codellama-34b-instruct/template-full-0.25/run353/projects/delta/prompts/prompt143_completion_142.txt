  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the current op, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the current op, which could cause the iterator to include the next op in the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the current op, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next op or include it twice.

DONE.
