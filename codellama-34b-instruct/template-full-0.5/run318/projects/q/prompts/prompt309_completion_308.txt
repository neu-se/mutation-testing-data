  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y));
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
