  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `cb` argument, which is not the case in the original code. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to the `abortCb` function is changed. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument is passed to the `abortCb` function. This could cause the `cb` function to be called with a
