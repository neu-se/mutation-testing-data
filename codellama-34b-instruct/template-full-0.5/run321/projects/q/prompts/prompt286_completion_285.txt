  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `resolver` is not a function, while this code checks if `resolver` is null. If `resolver` is null, the code would still try to call it as a function, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `resolver` is not a function, while this code checks if `resolver` is not an object. If `resolver` is an object, the code would still try to call it as a function, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `resolver` is not a function, while this code checks if `resolver` is not an instance of the `Function` constructor. If
