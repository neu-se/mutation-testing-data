  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of the value returned by `Buffer.isBuffer(content)`, potentially causing the `content.toString('utf8')` call to be skipped even when it should be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.isBuffer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `content` value is a buffer, whereas the original code uses the `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` function to check if the `content` value is a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first character of the `content` value is a UTF-8 character, whereas the original code uses the `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` function to check if the `content` value is a buffer.

DONE.
