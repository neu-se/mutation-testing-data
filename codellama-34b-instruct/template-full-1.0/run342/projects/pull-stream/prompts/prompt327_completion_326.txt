  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `end` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the negation of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `end` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the `end` variable minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `end` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the `end` variable multiplied by two.

DONE.
