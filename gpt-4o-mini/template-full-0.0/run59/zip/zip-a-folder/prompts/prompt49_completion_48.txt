Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize('error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `finalize` method to be called with a string argument instead of no argument, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors during the zipping process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument to `finalize` may cause the method to behave differently than expected, potentially leading to issues with the completion of the zipping process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` may not trigger the finalization process correctly, leading to incomplete or corrupted zip files.

DONE.
