  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new array to the `dispatch` method, containing all elements of the `args` array except the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat([42])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new array to the `dispatch` method, containing all elements of the `args` array followed by the value `42`.

DONE.
