  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the "delete" operation instead of "get". This could potentially cause the test to fail if the code being tested relies on the "get" operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the "set" operation instead of "get". This could potentially cause the test to fail if the code being tested relies on the "get" operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [key, value]);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the "post" operation instead of "get". This could potentially cause the test to fail if the code being tested relies on the "get" operation.

DONE.
