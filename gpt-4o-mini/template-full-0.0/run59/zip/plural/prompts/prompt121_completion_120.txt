Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds an 's' to words ending in 'ics', which is not the intended behavior for pluralization of such words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z]ics$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match only if there is a non-alphabetic character before 'ics', which would exclude valid words like 'mathematics' from being processed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms words ending in 'ics' to uppercase instead of returning them unchanged, which is not the expected pluralization behavior.

DONE.
