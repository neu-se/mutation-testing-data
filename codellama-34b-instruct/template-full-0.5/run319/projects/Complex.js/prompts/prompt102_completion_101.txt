  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is now 3 instead of 2, which would cause the negative sign to appear every 3rd iteration instead of every 2nd iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 1 is added to the result of the modulo operation, which would cause the negative sign to appear every 2nd iteration instead of every 1st iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the modulo operation is multiplied by 2, which would cause the negative sign to appear every 2nd iteration instead of every 1st iteration.

DONE.
