  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an event with the name "unhandledRejection" and the reason and promise as arguments, while the buggy code fragment emits an event with the name "unhandledRejection" and the reason and promise as arguments, but the reason is not passed as an argument.

DONE.
