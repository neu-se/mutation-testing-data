  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` parameter would be ignored, and the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of being rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be created and thrown, instead of using the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string would be thrown instead of an error object, and the promise would be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the original error.

DONE.
