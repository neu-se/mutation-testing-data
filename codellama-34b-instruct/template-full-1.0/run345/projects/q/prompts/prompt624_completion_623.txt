  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `Q(null)` would return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that the value is not a promise, whereas `Q` would return a resolved promise with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and `Q(undefined)` would return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that the value is not a promise, whereas `Q` would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and `Q(0)` would return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that the value is not a promise, whereas `Q` would return a resolved promise with the value `0`.

DONE.
