  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, url: 'https://example.com' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property would be overwritten with a hardcoded value, causing the method to always request the same URL, regardless of the actual options passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, extname: '.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extname` property would be overwritten with a hardcoded value, causing the method to always try to extract a file extension, regardless of the actual options passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, dest: path.join(__dirname, '../file.txt') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` property would be overwritten with a hardcoded value, causing the method to always try to write the file to a specific location, regardless of the actual options passed in.

DONE.
