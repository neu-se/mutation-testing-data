 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(value, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` accepts only one argument, passing an additional argument would not be handled by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Q.resolve` method instead of the `deferred.resolve` method, which might have different behavior or side-effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve(value);
