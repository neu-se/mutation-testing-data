  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `reverse()` function call.
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the array in place, whereas the original code fragment assigned the reversed array to a new variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `slice()` function call with negative argument.
```
props.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method with a negative argument would return a slice of the array from the end to the end, whereas the original code fragment returned the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with ternary operator.
```
min < 1 ? 1 : min 
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would evaluate to `1` if `min` is less than 1, and to `min` otherwise, whereas the original code fragment always returned `min`.

DONE.
