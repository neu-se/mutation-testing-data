  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return []; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of country objects, while this modified function always returns an empty array, causing the tests that rely on this function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of country objects, while this modified function always returns null, causing the tests that rely on this function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error('Test error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of country objects, while this modified function always throws an error, causing the tests that rely on this function to fail.

DONE.
