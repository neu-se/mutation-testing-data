  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the tangent, while `a` is used to calculate the cotangent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is used to calculate the tangent, while `b` is used to calculate the cotangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is used to calculate the tangent, while `a + b` is used to calculate the cotangent.

DONE.
