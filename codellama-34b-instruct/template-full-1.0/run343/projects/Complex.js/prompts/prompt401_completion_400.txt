  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(res['im'] <= 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the imaginary part of the result is less than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks whether it is not less than or equal to 0. This means that the new code fragment would only enter the if statement if the imaginary part of the result is greater than 0, while the original code fragment would enter the if statement if the imaginary part of the result is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the imaginary part of the result is less than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks whether it is greater than 0. This means that the new code fragment would only enter the if statement if the imaginary part of the result is strictly greater than 0, while the original code fragment would enter the if statement if the imaginary part of the
