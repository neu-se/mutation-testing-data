  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is a function that takes two arguments, but `null` is not a function and would cause an error if called with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is a function that takes two arguments, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error if called with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is a function that takes two arguments, but `{}` is an empty object and would not have the same behavior as a function.

DONE.
