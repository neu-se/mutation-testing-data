  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise, but it is not a property of the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is a property of the object returned by the `inspect` function, but it is not a property of the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect().state` is a property of the object returned by the `inspect` function, which is a property of the promise itself.

DONE.
