 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` condition in the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextStream()` function to be called even when an abort signal is received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Aborting...')
