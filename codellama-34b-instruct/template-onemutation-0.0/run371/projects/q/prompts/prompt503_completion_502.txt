  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the code, `null` would be treated as a value and passed as an argument to the `apply` method, while `void 0` would be treated as a keyword and would not be passed as an argument. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently and could lead to errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
