  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` function to always return `false`, as `this['re']` is always a number and will never be `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` function to always return `true`, as `this['im'] + 1` is always a number and will never be `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 0
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` function to always return `false`, as `this['im'] * 0` is always `0`, which is a number and will never be `NaN`.

DONE.
