Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.fulfill("This is a bug");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the string "This is a bug", whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of
