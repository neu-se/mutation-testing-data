  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with a specific message, while the modified code fragment emits an error event with a different message.

this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
