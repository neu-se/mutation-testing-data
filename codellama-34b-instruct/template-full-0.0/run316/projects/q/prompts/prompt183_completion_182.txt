  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `attempt1` is not an array or if `attempt1[1]` is not defined, even if `attempt1[0]` is a valid string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `attempt1` is not an array or if `attempt1[1]` is not `null`, even if `attempt1[0]` is a valid string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `attempt1` is not an array or if `attempt1[1]` is not an empty string, even if `attempt1[0]` is a valid string.
