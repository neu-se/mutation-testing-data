  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "samelevel", even if the link is not on the same level as the page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "internal", even if the link is external.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "sublevel", even if the link is on the same level as the page.

DONE.
