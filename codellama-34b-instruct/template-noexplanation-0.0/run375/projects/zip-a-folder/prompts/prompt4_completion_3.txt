  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `o.compression`. This will result in the `else` block being executed, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `o.compression`. This will result in the `else` block being executed, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `o.compression` is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium`, and `false` otherwise. This
