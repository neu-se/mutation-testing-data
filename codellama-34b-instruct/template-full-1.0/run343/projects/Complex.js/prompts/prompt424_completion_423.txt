  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is Not-a-Number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is neither Infinity nor Not-a-Number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function checks if a value is zero, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is Infinity.

DONE.
