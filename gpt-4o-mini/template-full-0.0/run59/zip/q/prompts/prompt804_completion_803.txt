Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, progressed, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is changed, causing the `progressed` callback to be invoked as a rejection handler instead of a progress handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` callback to be invoked as the fulfillment handler instead of being used for progress notifications, which would lead to incorrect handling of promise states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `progressed` callback would mean that no progress notifications would be handled, effectively ignoring any progress updates that occur.

DONE.
