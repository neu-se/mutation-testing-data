  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to the end of the word, while this replacement adds 's'. This would cause the plural function to produce incorrect results for words that should end with 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to the end of the word, while this replacement adds 'ies' to the end of the word. This would cause the plural function to produce incorrect results for words that should end with 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
