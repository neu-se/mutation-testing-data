  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key from a map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value associated with a key. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the `get` method to return `undefined` for all keys, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the `set` method.

DONE.
