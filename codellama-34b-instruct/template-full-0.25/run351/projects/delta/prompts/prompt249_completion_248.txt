  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.retain == null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `retain` property, while this code checks for its value to be `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.retain === 'number') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `retain` property, while this code checks for its value to be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.retain === 'object') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `retain` property, while this code checks for its value to be an object.

DONE.
