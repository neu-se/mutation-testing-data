  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `null` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with `null` as the argument, rather than the original `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with `undefined` as the argument, rather than the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with `0` as the argument, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with `0` as the argument, rather than the original `value`.

DONE.
