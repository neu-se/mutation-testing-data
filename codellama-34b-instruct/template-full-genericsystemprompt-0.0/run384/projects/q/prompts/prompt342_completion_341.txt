  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(new Error(exception));`, which creates a new Error object with the exception message as the error message. Replacing it with `return reject(exception)` would result in the exception object being rejected directly, which could lead to different behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(new Error(exception));`, which creates a new Error object with the exception message as the error message. Replacing it with `return resolve(exception)` would result in the exception object being resolved directly, which could lead to different behavior in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(new Error(exception));`, which creates
