  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `fallback` function is set to `null`, it would override the default behavior of the `Promise` constructor, which is to throw an error if the operation is not supported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback != null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `fallback` function is set to any value other than `null`, it would trigger the `else` block of the `if` statement in the `Promise` constructor, which would return the value of the `fallback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `fallback` function is set to `'foo'`, it would override the default behavior of the `Promise` constructor, which is to throw an error if the operation is not supported. However, the `Promise` constructor would not throw an error because
