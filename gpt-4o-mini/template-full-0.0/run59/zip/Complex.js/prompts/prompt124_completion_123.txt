Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `z` is infinite with a parameter, which is not how the `isInfinite` method is intended to be used, potentially leading to incorrect results when adding two complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for `this` being infinite, meaning that if `this` is infinite and `z` is not, the function would not return `Complex['INFINITY']`, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is infinite, which would lead to incorrect handling of the addition operation when one of the operands is infinite.

DONE.
