  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a method that adds a file to the archive, while `glob` is a method that adds a glob pattern to the archive. Using `file` instead of `glob` would result in a different set of files being included in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory
```
This would result in different behavior because `directory` is a method that adds a directory to the archive, while `glob` is a method that adds a glob pattern to the archive. Using `directory` instead of `glob` would result in a different set of files being included in the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` is a method that finalizes the archive, while `glob` is a method that adds a glob pattern to the archive. Using `finalize` instead of `glob`
