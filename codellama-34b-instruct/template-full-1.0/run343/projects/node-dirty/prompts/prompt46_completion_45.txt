  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + updater
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is not called with the correct argument. The `get` method returns the value associated with the key in the map, but it is not passed to the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key + updater))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with a different argument. The `get` method returns the value associated with the key in the map, but the `updater` function is called with the result of concatenating the key and the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with a different argument. The `get` method returns the value associated
