Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed with the read operation even when the mapper is busy, potentially leading to race conditions or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the read operation to continue if the operation was aborted, which contradicts the intended logic of stopping further processing when an abort signal is received.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, causing the read operation to always execute the first callback, regardless of whether the mapper is busy or not, leading to incorrect handling of the data flow.

DONE.
