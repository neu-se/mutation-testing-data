  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
  (a !== 0) ? a / 0 : 0,
  (b !== 0) ? -b / 0 : 0).atanh();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atanh` function to calculate the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the `atanh` function to calculate the inverse hyperbolic cotangent of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
  (a !== 0) ? a / 0 : 0,
  (b !== 0) ? -b / 0 : 0).acoth();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `acoth` function to calculate the inverse hyperbolic cotangent of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the `acoth` function to calculate the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the complex number.
