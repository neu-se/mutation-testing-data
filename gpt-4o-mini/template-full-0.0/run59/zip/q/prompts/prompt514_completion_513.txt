Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `deferred` to `null` would prevent any promise resolution or rejection from occurring, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred = Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing `deferred` with a resolved promise would cause the `then` method to be called immediately, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred = { resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} };
```
This would result in different behavior because creating a `deferred` object without proper promise functionality would mean that the promise would never resolve or reject, effectively making it a no-op.

DONE.
