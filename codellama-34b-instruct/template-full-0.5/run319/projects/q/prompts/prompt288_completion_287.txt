  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject = function (reason) {
    if (resolvedPromise) {
        return;
    }

    become(reject(reason));
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the code would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject = function (reason) {
    if (resolvedPromise) {
        return;
    }

    become(fulfill(reason));
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the code would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject = function (reason) {
    if (resolvedPromise) {
        return;
    }

    become(Q(reason));
};
```
