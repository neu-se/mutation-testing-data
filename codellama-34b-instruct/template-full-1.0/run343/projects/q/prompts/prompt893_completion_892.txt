  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with `null` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with `void 0` as the first argument.

DONE.
