  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track unhandled rejections differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
