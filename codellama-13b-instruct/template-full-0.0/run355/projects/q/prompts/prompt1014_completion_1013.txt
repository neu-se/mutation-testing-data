  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that resolves the deferred promise, while the buggy code fragment returns the deferred promise itself. This could cause issues if the code relies on the promise being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred promise, while the buggy code fragment resolves the deferred promise immediately. This could cause issues if the code relies on the promise being resolved asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred promise, while the buggy code fragment rejects the deferred promise. This could cause issues if the code relies on the promise being resolved successfully.

DONE.
