  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== null && otherData !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any values of `thisData` and `otherData`, regardless of their types or contents. In the original code, the condition `typeof thisData === 'object' && thisData !== null && typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null` checks that both `thisData` and `otherData` are objects that are not null, which is a more specific condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `thisData` is 0, regardless of the value of `otherData`. In the original code, the condition `typeof thisData === 'object' && thisData !== null && typeof otherData === 'object' && other
