  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0)
```
This code fragment creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array, which can be used to test the `allResolved` function's behavior when the input array is modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([])
```
This code fragment creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `promises` array and an empty array, which can be used to test the `allResolved` function's behavior when the input array is modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function(promise) { return promise; })
```
This code fragment creates a new array that contains the same elements as the `promises` array, but with each element wrapped in a new promise object. This can be used to test the `allResolved` function's behavior when the input array contains promises that are resolved with different values.

DONE.
