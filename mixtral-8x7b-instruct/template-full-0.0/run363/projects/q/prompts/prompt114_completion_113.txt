 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's `this` value would be set to the global object instead of `thisp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's second argument (the index) would be replaced with the number 42, causing the mapped array to contain different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's third argument (the array) would be replaced with a new empty function, causing the mapped array to contain functions instead of the original values.

DONE.
