  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the event emitter to emit an event with a different name, which would not be handled by any of the listeners.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the event emitter to emit an event with a different name, which would not be handled by any of the listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the event emitter to emit an event with a different name, which would not be handled by any of the listeners.

DONE.
