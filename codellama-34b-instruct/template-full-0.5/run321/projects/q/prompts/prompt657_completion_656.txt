  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a non-null value for the `arguments` parameter, but `null` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a non-null value for the `arguments` parameter, but `undefined` would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a non-empty array for the `arguments` parameter, but an empty array would result in an error.

DONE.
