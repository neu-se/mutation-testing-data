Option 1:  I replaced the PLACEHOLDER with:
```
"", fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in an error because the first argument of `access()` is expected to be a `path` but is instead the empty string. This would be a different error and failure than the intended behavior as it would cause the function to expect a path instead of receiving it.

Option 2: I replaced the PLACEHOLDER with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```

```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the
