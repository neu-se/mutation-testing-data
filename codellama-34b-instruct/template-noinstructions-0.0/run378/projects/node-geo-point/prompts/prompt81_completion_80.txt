  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects the longitude to be passed as the second argument, but passing the latitude would cause the method to use the wrong value, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects the longitude to be passed as the second argument, but passing the longitude plus 180 degrees would cause the method to use a different value, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects the longitude to be passed as the second argument, but passing the longitude multiplied by 2 would cause the method to use a different value, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results.
