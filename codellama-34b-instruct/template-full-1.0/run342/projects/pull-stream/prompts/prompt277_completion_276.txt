  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `_read` to `null` instead of the stream, which would cause the program to behave differently when trying to read from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `_read` to the string `'foo'`, which is not a stream, and would cause the program to behave differently when trying to read from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.isNotStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stream` is not a stream, which would cause the program to behave differently when trying to read from the stream.

DONE.
