  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `dest` property with an empty string, which would always return a string, even if the `dest` property is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `dest` property to uppercase, which would change the value of the property and potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `dest` property by `/` and return the last element of the resulting array, which could be different from the original `dest` property.

DONE.
