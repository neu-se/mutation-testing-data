  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `ops` being an object, which is the expected input for the `Delta` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for `ops` being an object, which is the expected input for the `Delta` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `ops` being an object, which is the expected input for the `Delta` constructor.

DONE.
