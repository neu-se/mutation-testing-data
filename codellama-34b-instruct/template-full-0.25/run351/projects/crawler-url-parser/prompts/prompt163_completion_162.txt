  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, whereas `includes` checks if the string contains the substring. In this case, `startsWith` would return `false` for the example input, whereas `includes` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, whereas `includes` checks if the substring is present in the string. In this case, `indexOf` would return `0` for the example input, whereas `includes` would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if the string matches the given regular expression, whereas
