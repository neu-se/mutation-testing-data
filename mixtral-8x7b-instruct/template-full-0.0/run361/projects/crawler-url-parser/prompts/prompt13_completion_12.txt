 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the 'http://' instead of replacing it, which could lead to incorrect protocol-less URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol to 'https://' instead of 'http://', which could cause issues if the URL does not support HTTPS.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//g, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'g' flag makes the regex global, replacing all occurrences of '//' in the string, not just the first one. This could lead to incorrect URLs if there are multiple '//' sequences in the URL.

DONE.
