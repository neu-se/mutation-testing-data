  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` and `isFinite` methods would return `false` instead of `true`, which could cause the `isInfinite` method to return the wrong result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': NaN }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` and `isFinite` methods would return `true` instead of `false`, which could cause the `isInfinite` method to return the wrong result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': Infinity }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` and `isFinite` methods would return `false` instead of `true`, which could cause the `isInfinite` method to return the wrong result.

DONE.
