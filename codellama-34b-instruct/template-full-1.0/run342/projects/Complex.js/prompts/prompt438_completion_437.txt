  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` and `Math.floor` have different rounding behavior for negative numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` and `Math.floor` have different rounding behavior for positive numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations and could produce a different result.

DONE.
