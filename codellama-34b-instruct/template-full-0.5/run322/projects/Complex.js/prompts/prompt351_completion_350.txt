  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the sign of the result, which would cause the complex cosh function to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of the input instead of the cosine, which would cause the complex cosh function to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the tangent of the input instead of the cosine, which would cause the complex cosh function to return incorrect values.

DONE.
