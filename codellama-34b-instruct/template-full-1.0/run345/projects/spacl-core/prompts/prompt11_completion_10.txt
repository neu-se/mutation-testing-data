  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the result of the `match()` method, causing the regex to match even if it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is a strict equality check, which would return `null` if the regex does not match, rather than returning a truthy value indicating a match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is a strict non-identity check, which would return a truthy value indicating a match if the regex does not match, rather than returning `null`.

DONE.
