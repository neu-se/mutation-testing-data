 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is used to parse JSON strings, not to match regular expressions. It would likely throw an error when called with the `tokens` variable, which is an array of matched substrings, not a JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` is used to evaluate JavaScript code represented as a string. It would likely execute arbitrary code, potentially causing unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
document.querySelector
```
This would result in different behavior because `document.querySelector` is used to select elements from a DOM tree. It would likely throw an error when called with the `tokens` variable, which is an array of matched substrings, not a DOM element.

DONE.
