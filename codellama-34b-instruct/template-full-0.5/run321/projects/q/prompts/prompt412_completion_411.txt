  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the promise is rejected, rather than fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the promise's value is undefined, rather than checking the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the promise is not fulfilled, rather than checking if it is fulfilled.

DONE.
