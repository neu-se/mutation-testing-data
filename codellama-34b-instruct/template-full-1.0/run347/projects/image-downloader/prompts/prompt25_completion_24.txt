  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__filename"
```
This would result in different behavior because when using `__filename`, the path returned would be relative to the current file, whereas `__dirname` returns the path relative to the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__dirname"
```
This would result in different behavior because when using `__dirname`, the path returned would be relative to the current directory, whereas `__filename` returns the path relative to the current file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"path.join(__dirname, '..', options.dest)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a path that is one level above the current directory, whereas `__dirname` returns the path relative to the current directory.

DONE.
