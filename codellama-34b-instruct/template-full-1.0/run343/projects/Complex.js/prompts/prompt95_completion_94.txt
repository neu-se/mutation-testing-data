  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable from `c`, which would cause the comparison to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"a"` is a string, which would cause the comparison to always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a".toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `"a".toLowerCase()` returns the string `"a"`, which would cause the comparison to always return `true`.

DONE.
