  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2]` element is different from the original `ref[1]` element, which could cause the function to produce different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `ref[1]` element, which could cause the function to produce different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of the `ref[1]` element, which could cause the function to produce different output.

DONE.
