  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` and `get` are different methods of the `Map` class, and they have different return values. `set` returns the map instance, while `get` returns the value associated with the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a property of the `Map` class that returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, while `get` is a method that returns the value associated with a given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `has` is a method of the `Map` class that returns a boolean indicating whether a given key exists in the map, while `get` is a method that returns the value associated with a given key.

DONE.
