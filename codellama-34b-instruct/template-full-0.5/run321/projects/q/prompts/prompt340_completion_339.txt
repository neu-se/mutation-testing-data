  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered resolved, even if it was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered resolved, even if it was pending or fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered resolved, even if it was rejected or fulfilled.

DONE.
