  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles rejected promises, whereas `then` is a method that handles fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that handles both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas `then` only handles fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, rejectionHandler)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would handle rejections differently than the original code, which only handles fulfillments.

DONE.
