  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being used in the original code, so the mutated code would behave differently when the `encoding` option is provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` property is not being used in the original code, so the mutated code would behave differently when the `flag` option is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.mode
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` property is not being used in the original code, so the mutated code would behave differently when the `mode` option is provided.

DONE.
