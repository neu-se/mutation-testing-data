  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Object.values(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values from an object, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of keys from an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Object.keys(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys from an object, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of values from an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  array.map(function (k) {
    return array[k]
  })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a function on each element in the original array, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of values from an object.

DONE.
