Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHead(this.statusCode + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the HTTP status code sent in the response would be incremented by 1, potentially changing the interpretation of the response by the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHeader
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeHeader` is a method that only writes the HTTP headers, but does not end the response, whereas `writeHead` is not a valid method, but `writeHeader` is not the same as `writeHead` which is the original method, this change would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.writeHead
```
This would result in different behavior because the context of `this` would be changed from the proxied `res` object to the original `res` object, potentially affecting the behavior of the `writeHead` method, although in this specific case it might not have a noticeable effect due to the way the proxy is implemented.

DONE.
