 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `bearing` to a number using the multiplication operator, which is less efficient and less clear than the original `Number()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat()` returns a floating point number, while `Number()` can return integers as well. This could lead to unexpected results if the input is an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds the input down to the nearest integer, while `Number()` converts the input to a number without changing its value. This could lead to unexpected results if the input is a float.

DONE.
