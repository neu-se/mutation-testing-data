  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which in this case is `this`. This means that the new function will always be called with `this` set to the promise object, regardless of how it is called. In the original code, `this` is not always the promise object, it depends on how the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function immediately with `this` set to the promise object. In the original code, the function is called later, when the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function immediately with `this` set to the promise object, and the arguments passed as an
