  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are different methods in the `inverted` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different methods in the `inverted` object, and `Op.length(op)` would return a different value than `op.insert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different methods in the `inverted` object, and `op.insert` would return a different value than `Op.length(op)`.

DONE.
