  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the value of the latitude in degrees, while this replacement uses the constant PI / 180, which is a value in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the value of the latitude in degrees, while this replacement uses the value of the latitude in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(longitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the value of the latitude in degrees, while this replacement uses the value of the longitude in radians.

DONE.
