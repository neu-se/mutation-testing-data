  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<currentUrl.url, currentUrl[0]>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the key as the first character of the URL, rather than the whole URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<currentUrl.url, Math.round(currentUrl.length/2)>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the key as the midpoint of the URL, rather than the whole URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<currentUrl.url, null>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the key altogether, making it difficult to access the URL object later.

DONE.
