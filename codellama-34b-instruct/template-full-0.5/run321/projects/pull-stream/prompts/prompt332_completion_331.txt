  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value for the `abort` parameter, which could lead to a different execution path in the `onEnd` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value for the `abort` parameter, which could lead to a different execution path in the `onEnd` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value for the `abort` parameter, which could lead to a different execution path in the `onEnd` function.

DONE.
