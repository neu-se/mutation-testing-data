  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two elements of the `other.ops` array, instead of just the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate the first two elements of the `other.ops` array, instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other.ops` array in reverse order, instead of the original order.

DONE.
