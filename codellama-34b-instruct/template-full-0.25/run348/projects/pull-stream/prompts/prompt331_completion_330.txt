  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes an argument, and passing `false` as an argument would cause the function to return without executing the code inside the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` as an argument would cause the function to execute the code inside the `if` statement, which would set `a` to `true` and call `onEnd` with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument would cause the function to execute the code inside the `if` statement, which would set `a` to `true` and call `onEnd` with `null`.

DONE.
