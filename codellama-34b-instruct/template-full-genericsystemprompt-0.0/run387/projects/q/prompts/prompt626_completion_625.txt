  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` simply references the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` calls the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` simply references the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` calls the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` simply references the `dispatch` method on the current `this` context.
