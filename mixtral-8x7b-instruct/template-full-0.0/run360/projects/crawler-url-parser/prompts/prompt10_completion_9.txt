 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'').concat(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally prepends an empty string to `currentUrlStr`, which may not be desired.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http:') || currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR (`||`) operator to return `currentUrlStr` if the replacement operation returns a falsy value (e.g., an empty string), which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https:')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the protocol with `https:` instead of `http:`, which may not be the desired behavior.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in catching potential issues that may arise due to
