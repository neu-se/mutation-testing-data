  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to be used instead of `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` to be used with an offset of 1, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` and `otherIter` to be used with the maximum length, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

DONE.
