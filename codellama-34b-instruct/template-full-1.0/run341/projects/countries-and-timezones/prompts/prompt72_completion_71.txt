  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an additional argument of `true`, which would cause it to return a different value than it would in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would be called instead of `buildTimezone`, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with a different argument, causing it to return a different value than it would in the original code.

DONE.
