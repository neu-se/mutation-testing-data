  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the real part.

DONE.
