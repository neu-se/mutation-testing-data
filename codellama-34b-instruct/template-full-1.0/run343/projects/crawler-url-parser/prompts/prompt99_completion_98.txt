  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the map has a property with the given name, rather than checking if the map has a property with the given value, which is the behavior of the original `has` method.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method of the map returns the value associated with the key provided as an argument, rather than returning a boolean indicating whether the map has a property with the given value.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!urlMap.has
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` is used, which would invert the boolean value returned by the `has` method. If the map has a property with the given value, the original code would return `true`, but this alternative would return `false`.

DONE.
