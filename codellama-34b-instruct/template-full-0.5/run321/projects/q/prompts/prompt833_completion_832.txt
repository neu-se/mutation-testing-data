  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not defined in the code, and it would cause a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is not defined in the code, and it would cause a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function is not defined in the code, and it would cause a ReferenceError.

DONE.
