  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.map.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.map.call` is a method that calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array with the results, whereas `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` is a method that returns an array of the values of an object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, whereas `Array.from` is a method that creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.filter.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.filter.call` is a method that calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array with the elements that pass the test, whereas
