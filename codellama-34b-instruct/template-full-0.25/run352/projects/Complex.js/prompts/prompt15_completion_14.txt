  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `x` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment is using the `x + 1` expression, which is a real number. This change would cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `x` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment is using the `x * 2` expression, which is a real number. This change would cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `x` variable
