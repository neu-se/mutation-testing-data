  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/s$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the 's' from the end of the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/es$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the 'es' from the end of the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/s$/, 'z')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the 's' at the end of the word with a 'z', resulting in a different plural form.

DONE.
