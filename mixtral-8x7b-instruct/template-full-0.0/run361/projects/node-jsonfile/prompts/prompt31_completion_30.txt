 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a replacer function as its second argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a replacer function as its second argument, and passing a boolean would not provide the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not replace any parts of the stringified object, whereas the original code fragment (`options`) might contain a custom replacer function that modifies the output.

DONE.
