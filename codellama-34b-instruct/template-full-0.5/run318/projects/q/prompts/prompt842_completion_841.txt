  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(ms).then(function() {
  throw new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with a custom error object, while this code fragment would reject the promise with a generic `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(ms, error).then(function() {
  throw new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the `error` object passed as an argument, while this code fragment would reject the promise with a generic `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(ms, error).then(function() {
  throw new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms");
