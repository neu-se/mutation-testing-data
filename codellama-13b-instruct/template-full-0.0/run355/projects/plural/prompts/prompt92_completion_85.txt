```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns "chillies" while the modified code fragment returns "chillis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns "chillis" while the modified code fragment returns "chillies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns "chillis" while the modified code fragment returns "chillies".

DONE.
