  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` argument is always `null`, which would cause the `nodeify` function to always return `undefined`, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` argument is always an empty function, which would cause the `nodeify` function to always return `undefined`, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` argument is always a function that throws an error, which would cause the `nodeify` function to always throw an error, even if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
