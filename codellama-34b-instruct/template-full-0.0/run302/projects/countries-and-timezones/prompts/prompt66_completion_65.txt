  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is truthy or falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is truthy or falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object if it is truthy, and the `options` object itself if it is falsy.

DONE.
