  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be called with the current value, index, and array, whereas the original code called the callback function with those arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.function(value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` would be used as the context for the function call, whereas the original code used the global context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + index + self
```
This would result in different behavior because the values would be added together, whereas the original code called the callback function with the values as arguments.

DONE.
