  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for `null`, causing the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for `undefined`, causing the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `true` for an empty object, causing the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a `GeoPoint` object with `latitude` and `longitude` set to `0`, instead of throwing a `RangeError` as the original code would.

DONE.
