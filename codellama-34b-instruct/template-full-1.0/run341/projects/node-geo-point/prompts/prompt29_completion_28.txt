  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `latitude` and `longitude` are swapped, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a wrong result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `latitude` of the first point instead of the second point, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a wrong result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, while `point2.latitude` is a variable representing the latitude of a point on the Earth's surface. Using `Math.PI` in this context could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a wrong result.

DONE.
