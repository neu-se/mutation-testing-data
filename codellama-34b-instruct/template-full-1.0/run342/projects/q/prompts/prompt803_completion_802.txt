  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function and `null` is not, so the code would crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function and `undefined` is not, so the code would crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function and this would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
