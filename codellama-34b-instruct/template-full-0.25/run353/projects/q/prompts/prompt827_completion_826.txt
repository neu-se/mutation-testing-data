  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and setting it to `null` would prevent it from being called when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` function with a new function that throws an error when called, causing the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` function with a new function that logs a message to the console when called, but does not actually handle the error.

DONE.
