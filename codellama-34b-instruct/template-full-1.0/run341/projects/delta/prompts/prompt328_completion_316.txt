  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the +1 would cause the iteration to start one position later, potentially skipping over the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp - 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the -100 would cause the iteration to start 100 positions earlier, potentially skipping over multiple elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.name` would cause an error, as `baseOp` is not an object and does not have a `name` property.

DONE.
