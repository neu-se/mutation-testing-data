  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not allowed in the `set` method, and the `null` value is a valid value that can be stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 0, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not allowed in the `set` method, and the `0` value is a valid value that can be stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, {}, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not allowed in the `set` method, and the `{}` value is a valid value that can be stored in the database.

DONE.
