  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.stack` property would be set to the stack trace of the error, but without the first line, which is always the same and not useful for debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.stack` property would be set to the stack trace of the error, but without the first two lines, which are always the same and not useful for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.stack` property would be set to the stack trace of the error,
