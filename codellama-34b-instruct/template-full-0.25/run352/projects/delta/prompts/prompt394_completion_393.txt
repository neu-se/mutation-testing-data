  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return the first element of the `other.ops` array, which may not be the same as the `length` of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return the second element of the `other.ops` array, which may not be the same as the `length` of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return the last element of the `other.ops` array, which may not be the same as the `length` of the array.

DONE.
