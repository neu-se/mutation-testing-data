  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flatten` is a function that expects a boolean argument, but `true` is not a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because `min` is a variable that represents the minimum number of times the wildcard should match, but `flatten` expects a boolean argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(max)
```
This would result in different behavior because `max` is a variable that represents the maximum number of times the wildcard should match, but `flatten` expects a boolean argument.

DONE.
