 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^/])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character except '/' instead of matching '.' or '$'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't have the global flag (g), so it only matches the first occurrence of '.' or '$' in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([\W])/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any non-word character, which includes '.' and '$', but also other characters like '\_', '+' and '-'.

DONE.
