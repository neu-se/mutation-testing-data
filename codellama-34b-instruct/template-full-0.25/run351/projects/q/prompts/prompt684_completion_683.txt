  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. Using `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` would result in a different value being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `arguments` is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Using `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would result in a different value being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
