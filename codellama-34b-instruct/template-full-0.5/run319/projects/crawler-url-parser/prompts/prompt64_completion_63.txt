  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host, {
  enableIDN: false
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable the parsing of internationalized domain names (IDNs), which could cause the function to return a different result for some URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host, {
  include_psl_private_domains: false
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude private domains from the parsing process, which could cause the function to return a different result for some URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host, {
  ignore_public_suffix_rules: true
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the public suffix rules, which could cause the function to return a different result for some URLs.

DONE.
