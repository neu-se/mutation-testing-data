 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would receive `null` as an argument instead of a resolver function. The resolver function is necessary for properly resolving or rejecting the deferred promise, so using `null` would cause the deferred promise to remain in a pending state indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return true; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would always return `true` instead of a resolver function. This would cause the deferred promise to be immediately resolved with the value `true`, regardless of the result of the `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method returns an object with `resolve` and `reject` properties, which are functions. By directly using
