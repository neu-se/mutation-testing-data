  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function to the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to the array. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the resolver function is not properly set up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
