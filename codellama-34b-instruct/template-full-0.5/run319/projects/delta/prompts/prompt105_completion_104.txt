  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(function(op) {
  op.attributes = null;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all attributes from the ops, which could cause the `retain` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(function(op) {
  op.insert = '';
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all `insert` operations with empty strings, which could cause the `retain` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(function(op) {
  op.delete = 0;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `delete` operation to 0, which could cause the `retain` method to behave differently.

DONE.
