  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners.length` would evaluate to `0` or `1`, and the `resolve` function would not be called in the `fulfill` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` in the `fulfill` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would create a copy of the `arguments` array, which would not have the same behavior as the original `fulfill` method.

DONE.
