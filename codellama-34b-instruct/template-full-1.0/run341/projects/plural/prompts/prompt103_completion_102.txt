  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cow|deer|fowl|halibut|mooose|sheep/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to use the operator `|` to match any of the words, instead of the constant `bison` and `sheep`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to include the word `cod` instead of `sheep`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|sheep|deer|fowl|halibut|moose/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to change the order of the words in the alternation.

DONE.
