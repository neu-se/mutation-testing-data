  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key)` would return the value associated with the `key` in the `_data` map, whereas `key` would return the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.size()` would return the number of key-value pairs in the `_data` map, whereas `key` would return the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.has(key)` would return a boolean indicating whether the `_data` map contains the key, whereas `key` would return the key itself.

DONE.
