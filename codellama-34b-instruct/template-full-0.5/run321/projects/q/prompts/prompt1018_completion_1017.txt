  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, while `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, while `deferred.notify` is used to notify the promise of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is used to create a new promise resolver.

DONE.
