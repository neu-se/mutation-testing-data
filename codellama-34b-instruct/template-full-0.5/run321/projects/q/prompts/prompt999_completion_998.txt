  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would not be called if the promise returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])` is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called even if the promise returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])` is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method would be called even if the promise returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs
