  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the last one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to be case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match across multiple lines, so it would match the last occurrence of the pattern on each line.

DONE.
