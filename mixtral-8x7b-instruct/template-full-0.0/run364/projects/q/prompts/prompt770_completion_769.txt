 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects an array of promises, and null is not an array. This would cause the function to throw a TypeError when trying to execute methods like `array_map` and `all` on a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would cause the `all` function to resolve immediately, while the original code would wait for all promises to settle before resolving. This would cause the `allResolved` function to return an empty array of promises instead of waiting for all promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{foo: 'bar'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function expects an array of promises, and an object is not an array. This would cause the function to throw a TypeError when trying to execute methods like `array_map`
