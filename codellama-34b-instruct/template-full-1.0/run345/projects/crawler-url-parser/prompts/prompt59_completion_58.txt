  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"false"
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would not be normalized correctly, potentially causing issues with the parsing and formatting of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would not be parsed correctly, potentially causing issues with the detection of illegal characters and the handling of base URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would not be parsed correctly, potentially causing issues with the detection of illegal characters and the handling of base URLs.

DONE.
