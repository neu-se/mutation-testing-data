  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment included the `*` and `+` operators in the regular expression, which were removed in this solution. The `*` operator matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character, and the `+` operator matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character. Without these operators, the regular expression would only match a single occurrence of the preceding character, rather than multiple occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d*\.\d\d+\.\d+|/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `\d` character class to match any digit, rather than just the `.` character. The regular expression in this solution only matches a dot `.` character, rather than any digit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\
