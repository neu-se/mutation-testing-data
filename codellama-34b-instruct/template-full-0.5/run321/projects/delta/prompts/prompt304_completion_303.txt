  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer be checking if the index is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the index is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the index is greater than 2.

DONE.
