  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function that returns the type of an object, but `type.toLowerCase()` is a string that is always lowercase, regardless of the type of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function that returns the type of an object, but `type.toUpperCase()` is a string that is always uppercase, regardless of the type of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function that returns the type of an object, but `type.charAt(0)` is a string that is the first character of the type of the object, regardless of the type of the object.

DONE.
