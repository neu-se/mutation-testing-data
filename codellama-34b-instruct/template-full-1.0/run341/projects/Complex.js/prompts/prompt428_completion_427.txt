  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the default value for `places` is 0 if it is `null` or `undefined`. However, if we replace `places || 0` with `places || 1`, the default value for `places` would be 1 instead of 0. This would cause the `Math.pow` function to behave differently, which would in turn affect the behavior of the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods.
DONE.
