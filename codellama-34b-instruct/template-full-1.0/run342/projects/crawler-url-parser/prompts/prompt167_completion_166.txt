  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the Boolean result of the `includes` method, so the returned value would be `true` if the `linkurl_path` does not contain the `pageurl_path`, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method returns `true` if the `pageurl_path` string starts with the `linkurl_path` string, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the `linkurl_path` string in the `pageurl_path` string, or `-
