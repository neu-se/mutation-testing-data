Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, leading to an error state rather than a successful resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the notify function instead of resolving the promise, which would not fulfill the promise and would not pass the value to the promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would lead to the resolver function being called with an undefined value, which would not resolve the promise correctly and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
