  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `===` checks if two values are strictly equal. In this case, `value` is a promise object, so `value === Promise` would return `false`, even though `value instanceof Promise` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object, while `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class. In this case, `value.constructor === Promise` would return `false`, even though `value instanceof Promise` would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getPrototypeOf()` returns the prototype of an object,
