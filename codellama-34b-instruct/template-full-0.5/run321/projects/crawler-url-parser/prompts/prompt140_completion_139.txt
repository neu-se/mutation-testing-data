  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it match across multiple lines.

DONE.
