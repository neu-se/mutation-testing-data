  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `options.dest` is `null`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `false` if `options.dest` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `options.dest` is `undefined`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `false` if `options.dest` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `options.dest` is an empty string, whereas the original code would evaluate to `false` if `options.dest` is an empty string.

DONE.
