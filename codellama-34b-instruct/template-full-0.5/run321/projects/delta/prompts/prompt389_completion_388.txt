  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current operation in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek().length` is the length of the current operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` is the length of the next operation in the iterator.

DONE.
