  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` is a function that returns the smallest number of the given arguments, whereas `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of the given argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a function that returns the square root of the given argument, whereas `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of the given argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` is a function that returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of the given argument.

DONE.
