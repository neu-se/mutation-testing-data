  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means the substring operation would start at the beginning of the word, whereas `1` would start at the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means the substring operation would start at the beginning of the word, whereas `-1` would start at the end of the word and work backwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means the substring operation would start at the beginning of the word, whereas `"hello"` is a string and would cause a type error.

DONE.
