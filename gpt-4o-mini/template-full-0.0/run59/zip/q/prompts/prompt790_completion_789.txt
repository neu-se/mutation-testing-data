Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `undefined` could lead to unexpected results in promise chains, as `null` is a falsy value but not the same as `undefined`, which may affect how subsequent `.then()` handlers are executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a number (1) instead of `undefined` would cause the promise to resolve with a value of 1, which could lead to unintended consequences in the promise chain, as it would change the resolved value that subsequent `.then()` calls would receive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a rejected promise instead of `undefined` would cause the promise chain to immediately reject, triggering any rejection handlers attached to it, which is a significant change in behavior compared to the original code.

DONE.
