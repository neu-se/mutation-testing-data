Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the filename to uppercase, which may not match the original filename's case, potentially leading to issues when saving or retrieving the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the file extension entirely, which could lead to incorrect file naming and loss of the original file type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '_')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores, which could alter the intended filename and affect file retrieval or processing.

DONE.
