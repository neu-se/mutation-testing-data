  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values()).filter(function (el) {
	return el.type == "internal";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would remove any elements from the array that have a type other than "internal", which would cause the `map()` method to skip over those elements and not create objects for them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values()).map(function (el) {
	return {
		url: el.url,
		text: el.text,
		type: "internal"
	}
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method would create objects with a "type" property that is always set to "internal", regardless of the original value of the "type" property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values()).map(function (el) {
