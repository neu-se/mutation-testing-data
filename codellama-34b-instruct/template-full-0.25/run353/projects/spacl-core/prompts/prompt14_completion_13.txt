  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if the pattern does not match, so the `!==` operator would evaluate to `true` if the pattern does not match, while the `===` operator would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `undefined` if the pattern does not match, so the `!==` operator would evaluate to `true` if the pattern does not match, while the `===` operator would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== null && spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` or `undefined` if the pattern does not match,
