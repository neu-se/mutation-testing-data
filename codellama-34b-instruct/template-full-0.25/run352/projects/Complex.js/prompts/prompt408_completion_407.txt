  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp * 0` would always evaluate to 0, regardless of the value of `temp`, whereas `temp` would retain its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp + 1` would always add 1 to the value of `temp`, whereas `temp` would retain its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp - 1` would always subtract 1 from the value of `temp`, whereas `temp` would retain its original value.

DONE.
