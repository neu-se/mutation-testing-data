  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root operation would be performed on a negative number, which would result in a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root operation would be performed on a number that is greater than 1, which would result in a number that is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root operation would be performed on a number that is less than 1, which would result in a number that is less than 1.

DONE.
