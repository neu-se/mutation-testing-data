  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty slice, whereas the original code would return a slice containing the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice containing the second element of the array, whereas the original code would return a slice containing the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice containing the first two elements of the array, whereas the original code would return a slice containing only the first element.

DONE.
