  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for all inputs, as `null` does not have any own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for all inputs, as `undefined` does not have any own properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for all inputs, as an empty object does not have any own properties.

DONE.
