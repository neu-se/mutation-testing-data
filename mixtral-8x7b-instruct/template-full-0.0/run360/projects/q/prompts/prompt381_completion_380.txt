This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would no longer pass the original promise value to the callback. Instead, it would always pass an already resolved promise, which might cause the callback to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Buggy!'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would now pass a rejected promise to the callback. This could cause the callback to behave differently, as it would have to handle the rejected promise instead of the original resolved value. Additionally, the
