  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'function' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is an object, while this code checks if it is a function. This change would cause the `insert` method to always add the `attributes` object to the `newOp` object, even if it is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has any keys, while this code checks if it has more than one key. This change would cause the `insert` method to always add the `attributes` object to the `newOp` object, even if it is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
