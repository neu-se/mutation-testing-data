  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')

This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\default\.[a-z]+$/` would not match the string `/index.html`, which would result in a different value for `pageurl_path` and potentially different behavior in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
