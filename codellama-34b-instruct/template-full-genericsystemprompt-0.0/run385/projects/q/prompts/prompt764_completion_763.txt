  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would be replaced with `noop`, which would not update the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, function (progress) {
    deferred.notify({
        index: index,
        value: progress
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would be replaced with a new function that would update the progress of the promise.

DONE.
