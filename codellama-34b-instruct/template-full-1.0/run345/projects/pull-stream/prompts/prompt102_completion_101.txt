  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn()` function is used instead of `console.log()` and it will print a message to the console with a warning icon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error()` function is used instead of `console.log()` and it will print a message to the console with an error icon and red background.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info()` function is used instead of `console.log()` and it will print a message to the console with an info icon and blue background.

DONE.
