  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` is the name of the current module file, while `__dirname` is the name of the current module's parent directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the parent directory of the given path, while `__dirname` returns the name of the current module's parent directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(options.dest).dir
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse()` returns an object with information about the given path, including the directory name, while `__dirname` returns the name of the current module's parent directory.

DONE.
