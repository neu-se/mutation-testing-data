  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("uj"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of returning empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a generic error instead of returning empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a timeout error instead of returning empty.

DONE.
