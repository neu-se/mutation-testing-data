Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a non-existent `notify` method on the promise, which would lead to a runtime error instead of correctly passing the progress notification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return progressed + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the progress value by incrementing it, which could lead to incorrect progress reporting compared to the original behavior of simply passing the progress value unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `undefined` instead of the progress value, causing the progress notifications to effectively be ignored, which would not reflect the actual progress of the promise.

DONE.
