  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the dot product of the two vectors, but this replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the dot product of the two vectors, but it also multiplies the result by the `sin` of the latitude of the first point, which is not present in the original code fragment. This would cause the calculation of the dot product to be affected by the latitude of the first point, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad) * cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the dot product of the two vectors, but this replacement code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the dot product of the two vectors, but it also multiplies the result by the `cos` of the latitude of the first
