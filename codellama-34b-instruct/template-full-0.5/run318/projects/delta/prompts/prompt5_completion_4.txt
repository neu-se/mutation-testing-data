  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keepNull` variable is initialized to `false`, but the original code fragment checks if it is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the value of `keepNull`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `keepNull` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks if the value of `keepNull` is not `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `keepNull` is `false`.

DONE.
