  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a special case for the word "criteria," which is not handled correctly by the new code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a special case for the word "criteria," which is not handled correctly by the new code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a special case for the word "criteria," which is not handled correctly by the new code fragment.

DONE.
