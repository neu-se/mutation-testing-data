  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` returns a promise for the value of the promise, while `promise.inspect.value` returns the value of the promise directly, without waiting for it to be resolved.

DONE.
