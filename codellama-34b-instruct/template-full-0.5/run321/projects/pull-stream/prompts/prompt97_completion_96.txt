  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so the callback would be called even if `ended` is already `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the callback would only be called if `ended` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the callback would only be called if `ended` is `false`.

DONE.
