  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and therefore does not have a `reviver` property, which is used in the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is an object, but it does not have a `reviver` property, which is used in the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object, but it does not have a `reviver` property, which is used in the `JSON.parse()` method.

DONE.
