  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    key++
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` would be incremented, potentially changing the key being set in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the key being set in the database would be doubled, potentially changing the behavior of the application that relies on the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    key = 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key being set in the database would be changed to a constant value, potentially causing errors in the application that relies on the database.

DONE.
