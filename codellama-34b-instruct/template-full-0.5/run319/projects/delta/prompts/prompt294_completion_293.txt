  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one more step than the original code, potentially skipping over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would rewind the iterator by one step, potentially causing the algorithm to skip over the previous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by twice the current index, potentially skipping over multiple operations.

DONE.
