  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that checks if a string contains a certain substring, while `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches of a regular expression in a string, while `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, while `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

DONE.
