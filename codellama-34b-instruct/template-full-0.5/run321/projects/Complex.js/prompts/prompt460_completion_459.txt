  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this replacement checks if it is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`. This would cause the `toString` method to return a different value for the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this replacement checks if the absolute value of `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`. This would cause the `toString` method to return a different value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
