  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI + Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing as the difference between the longitudes, but this change adds Pi to the result, which would have a significant impact on the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing as the difference between the longitudes, but this change multiplies the difference by 2, which would result in a different bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing as the difference between the longitudes, but this change multiplies the difference by 10, which would result in a much larger bearing than the original code.

DONE.
