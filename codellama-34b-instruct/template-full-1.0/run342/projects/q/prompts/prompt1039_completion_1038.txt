  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() {
    var resolved = false;
    return {
        resolve: function() {
            resolved = true;
        },
        promise: function() {
            return resolved;
        }
    };
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the promise to a resolved state in the deferred object, which would affect the behavior of the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    var resolved = false;
    return {
        resolve: function() {
            resolved = true;
        },
        promise: function() {
            return resolved;
        }
    };
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the promise to a resolved state in the deferred object, which would affect the behavior of the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() {
    var resolved = true;
    return {
