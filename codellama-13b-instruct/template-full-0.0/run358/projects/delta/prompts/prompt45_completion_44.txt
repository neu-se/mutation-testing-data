  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' || b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is an object or null, while the buggy code fragment checks if `b` is not an object or null. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `b` is an object or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is an object or null, while the buggy code fragment checks if `b` is not an object and not null. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `b` is an object but not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is an object or null,
