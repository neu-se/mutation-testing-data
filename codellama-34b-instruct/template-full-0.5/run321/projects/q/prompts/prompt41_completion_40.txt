  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is called when the event loop is empty, but `flush()` is a function call that will execute the `flush` function immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is called when the event loop is empty, but `flush + 1` is a function call that will execute the `flush` function immediately and then add 1 to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is called when the event loop is empty, but `flush.call(null)` is a function call that will execute the `flush` function immediately with a null context.

DONE.
