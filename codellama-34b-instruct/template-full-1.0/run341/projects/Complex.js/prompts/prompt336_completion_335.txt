  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` and `acos` have different behavior when the input is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` and `acos` have different behavior when the input is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` and `acos` have different behavior when the input is not a pure real or imaginary number.

DONE.
