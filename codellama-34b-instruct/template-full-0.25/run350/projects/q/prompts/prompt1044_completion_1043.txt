  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only retrieves the "head" property of the promise, while this new code fragment retrieves the "tail" property instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only retrieves the "head" property of the promise, while this new code fragment retrieves the "tail" property of the "head" property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only retrieves the "head" property of the promise, while this new code fragment retrieves the "head" property of the "tail" property.

DONE.
