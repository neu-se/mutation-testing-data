  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is being passed as the `this` context, instead of `resolvedPromise` and `args` being passed as separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is being accessed as an array, instead of being passed as a separate argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new deferred object is being created, instead of using the existing `deferred` object.

DONE.
