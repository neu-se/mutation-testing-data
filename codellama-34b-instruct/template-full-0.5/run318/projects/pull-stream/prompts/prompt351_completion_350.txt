  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test` is a function that takes an argument, but `test.test(data)` is a function that takes two arguments, `test` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test` is a function that takes an argument, but `test.test(data, data)` is a function that takes two arguments, `data` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test` is a function that takes an argument, but `test.test(data, 1)` is a function that takes two arguments, `data` and `1`.

DONE.
