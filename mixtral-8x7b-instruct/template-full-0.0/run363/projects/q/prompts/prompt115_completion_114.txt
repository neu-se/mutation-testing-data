 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's second argument (`index`) would be `null` for at least one iteration, which might cause issues if the callback is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1/0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's second argument (`index`) would be replaced with `Infinity` or `-Infinity` (depending on the sign of the divisor), which might cause issues if the callback is not designed to handle such values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
