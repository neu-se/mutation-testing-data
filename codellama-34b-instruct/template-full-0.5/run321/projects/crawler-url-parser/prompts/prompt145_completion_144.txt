  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash (/) as the path separator, while the new code fragment uses the backslash (\) as the path separator. This could cause issues with the code's ability to correctly parse and handle URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash (/) as the path separator, while the new code fragment uses the forward slash followed by another forward slash (//) as the path separator. This could cause issues with the code's ability to correctly parse and handle URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash (/) as the path separator, while the new code fragment uses the backslash (\) as the path separator. This could cause issues with the code's ability to correctly parse and handle URLs.
