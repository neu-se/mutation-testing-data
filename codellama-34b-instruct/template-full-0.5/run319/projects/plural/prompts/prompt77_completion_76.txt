  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', 'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only has two elements, while the new code fragment has three elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has two elements, while the new code fragment has three elements, and the last element is different from the first element.

DONE.
