 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the absolute value of `b` as 0, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a random value for the absolute value of `b`, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the absolute value of `a` as the second argument for the `hypot` function, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse.

DONE.
