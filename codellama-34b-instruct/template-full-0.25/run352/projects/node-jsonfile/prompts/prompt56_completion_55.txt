  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the beginning of the string instead of the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(EOL, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the EOL character instead of the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\r?\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching both the carriage return and newline characters instead of just the newline character.

DONE.
