  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let embedType = Object.keys(op.retain)[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()[0]` returns the first key in an object, but the first key may not be the type of embed being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let embedType = op.retain.constructor.name;
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor.name` returns the name of the constructor function that created the object, but the name of the constructor function may not be the same as the type of embed being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let embedType = Object.keys(op.retain).pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys().pop()` returns the last key in an object, but the last key may not be the type of embed being used.

DONE.
