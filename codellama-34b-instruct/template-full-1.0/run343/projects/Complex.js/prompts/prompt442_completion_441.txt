  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var complex = new Complex(a, b);
complex.conjugate('asech')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `conjugate` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and attempting to call it would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var complex = new Complex(a, b);
complex.invere()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invere` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and attempting to call it would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var complex = new Complex(a, b);
complex.inv()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inv` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and attempting to call it would cause a type error.

DONE.
