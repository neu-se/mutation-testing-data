  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a variable that refers to an object with two properties ("head" and "tail"), and using `closed.resolve()` with this object as an argument would cause the `closed` promise to resolve with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `closed` promise to be rejected as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `closed` promise to resolve with the `ends.promise` object, which is not necessarily the same as the original `end` object that was used to construct the queue.

DONE.
