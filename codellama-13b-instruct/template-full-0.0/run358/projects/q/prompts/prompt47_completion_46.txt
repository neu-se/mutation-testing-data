  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` function is called after the `runSingle` function, which would cause the `domain` to be exited before the task is run. This could potentially cause issues if the task relies on the `domain` being active.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.enter()` function is called after the `runSingle` function, which would cause the `domain` to be entered after the task is run. This could potentially cause issues if the task relies on the `domain` being inactive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.dispose()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.dispose()` function is called after the `runSingle` function, which would cause the `domain` to be disposed of after the task is run. This could potentially cause issues if the task
