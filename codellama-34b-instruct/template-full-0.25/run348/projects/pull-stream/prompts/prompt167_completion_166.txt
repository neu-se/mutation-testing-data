  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called with a different argument, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called with a different argument, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called with a different argument, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
