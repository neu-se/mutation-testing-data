  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, and in this case, we want to check if it's not a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and in this case, we want to check if it's greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, and in this case, we want to check if it's not null.

DONE.
