  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function () {
    return {
        foo: "bar"
    };
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code defines a function that returns an object with a property "foo" set to "bar". The new code defines a function that returns an object with a property "foo" set to "bar", but it also defines a function that returns an object with a property "baz" set to "qux". This would cause the test suite to fail if it is testing for the presence of the "baz" property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function () {
    return {
        foo: "baz"
    };
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code defines a function that returns an object with a property "foo" set to "bar". The new code defines a function that returns an object with a property "foo" set to "baz". This would cause the test suite to fail if it is testing for the value of the "foo" property
