  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start - index` expression would be replaced with `start + index`, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start - index` expression would be replaced with `start - 1`, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start - index` expression would be replaced with `start + 1`, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
