  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` data structure would throw an error when trying to set a key-value pair with a null key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` data structure would throw an error when trying to set a key-value pair with an undefined key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` data structure would throw an error when trying to set a key-value pair with an empty string key.

DONE.
