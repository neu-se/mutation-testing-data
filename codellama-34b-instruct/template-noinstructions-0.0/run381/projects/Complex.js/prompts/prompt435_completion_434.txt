  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `Math.pow(10, places || 0)`, which raises 10 to the power of `places`, or 0 if `places` is not provided. Replacing `10` with `0` would cause the function to always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `Math.pow(10, places || 0)`, which raises 10 to the power of `places`, or 0 if `places` is not provided. Replacing `10` with `-1` would cause the function to always return -1, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `Math.pow(10, places || 0
