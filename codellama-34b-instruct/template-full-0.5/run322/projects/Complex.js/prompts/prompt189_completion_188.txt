  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if it is not equal to zero. This would cause the code to take a different execution path, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if `b` is not equal to zero. This would cause the code to take a different execution path, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to zero. This would cause the code to take a different execution path, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
