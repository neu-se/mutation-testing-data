  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This code fragment will add an extra "s" to the end of the word, which is not the intended behavior for the "ics" rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This code fragment will remove the last character of the word, which is not the intended behavior for the "ics" rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This code fragment will convert the word to uppercase, which is not the intended behavior for the "ics" rule.

DONE.
