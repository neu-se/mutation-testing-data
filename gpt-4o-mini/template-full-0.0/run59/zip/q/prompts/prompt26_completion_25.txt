Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `runSingle` function to attempt to execute `undefined` as a function, leading to a runtime error instead of executing the intended task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also cause the `runSingle` function to attempt to execute `null` as a function, resulting in a runtime error, similar to the first option.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Task failed"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately throw an error when the task is executed, simulating a failure in the task execution instead of running the intended task.

DONE.
