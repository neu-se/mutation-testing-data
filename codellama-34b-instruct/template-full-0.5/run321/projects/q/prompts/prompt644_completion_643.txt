  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will always return a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library and may return a resolved or rejected promise depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will always return a resolved promise, whereas `Q` may return a rejected promise if the input is not a valid promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` will always return a pending promise, whereas `Q` may return a resolved or rejected promise depending on the input.

DONE.
