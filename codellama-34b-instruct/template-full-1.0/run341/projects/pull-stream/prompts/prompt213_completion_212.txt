  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is never defined, but `true` is a constant value that is always truthy. In the original code, `aborted` is defined as a parameter in the `next` function, and it is used to check if the mapping should be aborted. If `aborted` is truthy, the mapping will be aborted, otherwise, it will continue. Replacing `aborted` with `true` would cause the mapping to be aborted regardless of whether it should be or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a constant value that is always falsy. In the original code, `aborted` is defined as a parameter in the `next` function, and it is used to check if the mapping should be aborted. If `aborted` is falsy, the mapping will continue, otherwise, it will be aborted. Replacing `aborted` with
