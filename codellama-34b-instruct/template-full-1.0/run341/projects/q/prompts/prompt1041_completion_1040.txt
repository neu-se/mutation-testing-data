  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `ends.resolve` with an object containing the `head` and `tail` properties, but this code resolves `ends.resolve` with the `next.promise` object itself, which is a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: Q.resolve(next)
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `ends.resolve` with an object containing the `head` and `tail` properties, but this code resolves `ends.resolve` with an object containing the `head` and `tail` properties, but also resolves `next` with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: Q.resolve(next).then(function(result) {
