  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs + 1` is a nonsensical expression that would result in a `TypeError` when called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs - 1` would return the absolute value of the number minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs * 2` would return the absolute value of the number times 2.

DONE.
