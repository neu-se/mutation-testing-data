Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `delta` object without chopping it, potentially leading to an incorrect representation of the operations if there are any trailing operations that should be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate an empty `Delta` to the result, which may introduce unnecessary operations into the final `Delta`, altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would chop off the last operation from the `delta`, which could lead to loss of important operations that should be included in the final result.

DONE.
