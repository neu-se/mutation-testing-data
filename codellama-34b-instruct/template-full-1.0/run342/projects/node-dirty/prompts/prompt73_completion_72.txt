  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is an object, not a string, so it would never strictly equal a string like `'ENOENT'`. Instead, the code would check whether `err` is truthy or falsy, which would not be useful for determining if the error is an errno exception with ENOENT as the error code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is an object, but this code would correctly check the error code stored in the `code` property of `err`. However, this would not catch cases where `err` is not an object or does not have a `code` property, which could be a bug in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the error
