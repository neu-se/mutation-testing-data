  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: zipFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` parameter is now set to `'zip'` instead of `'tar'`, which would cause the `compress` function to use different compression options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.low}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compression` option is now set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.low` instead of the default `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`, which would cause the `compress` function to use different compression options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_
