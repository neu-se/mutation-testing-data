 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections, Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject(reason)` is used instead of `promise`, which changes the behavior of the unhandled rejection tracking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[], promise
