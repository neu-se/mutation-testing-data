  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array instead of a slice of it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0], args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument and a slice of the `args` array starting from the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `name` value twice.

DONE.
