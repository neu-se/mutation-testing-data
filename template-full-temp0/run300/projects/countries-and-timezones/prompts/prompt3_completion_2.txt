  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object for the given id, rather than the entire data object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id].name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone for the given id, rather than the entire data object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id].offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the offset of the timezone for the given id, rather than the entire data object.

DONE.
