  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `error` is falsy or if it is a string, while the new code fragment checks if `error` is truthy and if it is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `error` is falsy or if it is not a string, while the new code fragment checks if `error` is truthy and if it is not a string.

DONE.
