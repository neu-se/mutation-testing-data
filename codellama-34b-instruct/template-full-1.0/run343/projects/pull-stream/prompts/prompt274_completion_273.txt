  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `once` to create a new function that was only called once, but by replacing it with `none`, the function would be called multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `once` to create a new function that was only called once, but by replacing it with `never`, the function would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `once` to create a new function that was only called once, but by replacing it with `2`, the function would be called twice.

DONE.
