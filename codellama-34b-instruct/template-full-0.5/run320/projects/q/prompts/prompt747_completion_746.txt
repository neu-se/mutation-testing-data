  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object is being passed to the `then` method, which would cause the `onFulfilled` function to be called with the resolved value of the promise, rather than the `promise` object itself.

```
promise.then(onProgress, onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would be called with the progress value of the promise, rather than the `onFulfilled` or `on
