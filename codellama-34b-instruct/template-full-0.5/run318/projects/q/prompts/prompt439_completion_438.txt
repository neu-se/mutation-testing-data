  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise, which would be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method returns a new promise, which would be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method returns a new promise, which would be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

DONE.
