  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator of places would be 9 instead of 10, which would cause the ceil function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator of places would be 12 instead of 10, which would cause the ceil function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator of places would be 5 instead of 10, which would cause the ceil function to return a different result.

DONE.
