 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the string, regardless of the actual values of `re` and `im`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isNaN()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `isNaN` method on the `this` object, rather than passing the values of `re` and `im` to the global `isNaN` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Number.isNaN(this.re, this.im)
