  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `null` arguments, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `null` and `data` arguments, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
