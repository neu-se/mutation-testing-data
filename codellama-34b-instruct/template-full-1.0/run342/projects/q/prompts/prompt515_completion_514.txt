  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (name === null || name === undefined) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code checks for both `null` and `undefined`, but the new code only checks for `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (name === null || name === void 0) {
```
This is similar to the current code, but the `void 0` is a slightly different way of writing `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (name === "null" || name === "undefined") {
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code checks for the `null` and `undefined` primitives, but the new code checks for the strings `"null"` and `"undefined"` instead.

DONE.
