  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'drain' would be emitted every time the `set` method is called, regardless of whether the queue is empty or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Drain event was not emitted'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'error' would be emitted every time the `set` method is called, regardless of whether the queue is empty or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'drain' would be emitted with the current size of the queue, which would cause the `_flush` method to be called even if the queue is not empty.

DONE.
