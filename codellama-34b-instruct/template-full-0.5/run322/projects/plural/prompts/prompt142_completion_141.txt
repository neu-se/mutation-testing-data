  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[0] === 'string' && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of the operand, while the `type()` function checks the type of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString() === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method converts the value of the operand to a string, while the `type()` function checks the type of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, while the `type()` function checks the type of the object.

DONE.
