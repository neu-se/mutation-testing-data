 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object wrapper around the input, potentially changing the behavior of the `isObject` check and other property checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{...point}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the input, potentially changing the behavior of the `isObject` check and other property checks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(point))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a deep copy of the input, potentially changing the behavior of the `isObject` check and other property checks.

These changes introduce new behaviors that may not be accounted for in the existing tests, potentially revealing weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
