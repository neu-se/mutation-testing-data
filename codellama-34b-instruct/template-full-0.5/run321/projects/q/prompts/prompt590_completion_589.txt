  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, whereas `makeGenerator` is a reference to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function immediately with the specified `this` value, whereas `makeGenerator` is a reference to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function immediately with the specified `this` value and an array of arguments, whereas `makeGenerator` is a reference to the original function.

DONE.
