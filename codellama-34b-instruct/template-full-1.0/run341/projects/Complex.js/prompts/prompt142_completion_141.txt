  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.isInfinite()` is a function that checks whether the current complex number is infinite, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is intended to be a boolean expression evaluating to true if the current complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false;
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a constant expression evaluating to false, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is intended to be a boolean expression evaluating to true if the current complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a constant expression evaluating to null, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is intended to be a boolean expression evaluating to true if the current complex number is infinite.

DONE.
