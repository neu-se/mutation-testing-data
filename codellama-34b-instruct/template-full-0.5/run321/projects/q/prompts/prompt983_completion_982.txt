  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.reject` function to be called with the error object instead of the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.reject` function to be called with a different error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.reject` function to be called with a `null` error object instead of the expected error object.

DONE.
