  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function expects a data object as its first argument, and passing the string `'test'` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
data.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function expects a time zone name as its second argument, and passing `data.countries` (which is an array of country objects) would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
data.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function expects a time zone name as its second argument, and passing `data.timezones` (which is an array of time zone objects) would cause an error.

DONE.
