 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, AttributeMap.invert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `AttributeMap.invert` function, which would change the context and possible behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(AttributeMap.invert) ? AttributeMap.invert : []
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `AttributeMap.invert` is an array and replaces it with an empty array if it's not, which is not the intended behavior and would cause unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(...args) => { AttributeMap.invert(...args); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that wraps the `AttributeMap.invert` function, which could cause issues with context and potentially change the behavior of the original function.

DONE.
