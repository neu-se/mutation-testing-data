  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is a different array from `unhandledRejections`, and would not contain the same elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is a different array from `unhandledRejections`, and would not contain the same elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array `[]` would not contain any elements, whereas `unhandledRejections` and `reportedUnhandledRejections` would contain elements.

DONE.
