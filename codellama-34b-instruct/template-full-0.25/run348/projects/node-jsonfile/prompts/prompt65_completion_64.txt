  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')

This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, while this replacement uses a string literal to match the BOM.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, while this replacement uses a string literal to match the BOM. If the input string does not contain the BOM, the replacement will not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '\\uFEFF')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to match the Unicode
