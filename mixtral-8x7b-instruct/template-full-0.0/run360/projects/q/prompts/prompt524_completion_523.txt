 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is an object in JavaScript, but it might not have the same properties as the original `object`. Developers testing their code with this mutation would expect the test to fail since the behavior of the code would be different when passing `null` instead of a regular object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array `[]` is not the same as an object. Developers testing their code with this mutation would expect the test to fail since the behavior of the code would be different when passing an array instead of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is not an object. Developers testing their code with this mutation would expect the test to fail since the behavior of the code would be different when passing a function instead of an object.
