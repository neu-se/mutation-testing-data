  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is always truthy, whereas `thisOp.delete` is only truthy if the operation is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is always truthy, whereas `thisOp.delete` is only truthy if the operation is a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.attributes` is always truthy, whereas `thisOp.delete` is only truthy if the operation is a delete operation.

DONE.
