  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to handling arguments. `call` expects a `this` argument before the function arguments, while `apply` expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument, and the arguments passed to the new function are appended to the arguments passed to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument, and the arguments passed to the new function are appended to the arguments passed to the original function. By passing `null` as the
