  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in a difference in the output because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while the new fragment does not modify the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in a difference in the output because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while the new fragment adds 'es' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in a difference in the output because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while the new fragment adds 'ies' to the end of the word.

DONE.
