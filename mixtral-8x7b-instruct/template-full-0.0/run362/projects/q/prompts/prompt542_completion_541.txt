 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new empty array, whereas the original code fragment reuses the `array` variable passed to the `spread` function. This could lead to issues if the original `array` variable is modified before the yielded promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the value of `this` in the current context, which might not be the expected array. The original code fragment explicitly passes the resolved array to the `fulfilled` callback, ensuring the correct context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the keys of the array as arguments to the `fulfilled` callback instead of the array elements. This would cause the `fulfilled` callback to behave unexpectedly, as it expects an array of values rather than an array of keys.
