 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'round' method would round to a different precision than intended by the original code, which always rounds to the precision specified by the `places` argument or to the nearest integer if no argument is provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places ?? 0
