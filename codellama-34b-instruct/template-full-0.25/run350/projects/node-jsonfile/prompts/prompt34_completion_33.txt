  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.toString()` returns a string representation of the file object, whereas `file` returns the file object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because `file + '.json'` returns a string that is the concatenation of the file name and the string '.json', whereas `file` returns the file object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync(file)` reads the file synchronously and returns its contents as a string, whereas `file` returns the file object itself.

DONE.
