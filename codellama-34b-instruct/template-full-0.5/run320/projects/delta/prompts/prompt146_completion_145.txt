  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `next()` returns the next element and advances the iterator. This would cause the loop to iterate over the same element multiple times, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(2)` advances the iterator by 2 elements, whereas `next()` advances it by 1 element. This would cause the loop to skip over every other element in the iteration, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `previous()` moves the iterator back one element, whereas `next()` moves it forward. This would cause the loop to iterate over the elements in reverse order, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
