  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `parse` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` takes a single argument, whereas `Math.cos` takes two arguments. This would cause the `parse` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a given angle. This would cause the `parse` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
