  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const cb of cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment modifies `this._data` inside the loop, while the modified code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const cb of Array.from(cbs));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment modifies `this._data` while iterating over the `cbs` object, while the modified code fragment creates a new array from `cbs` and iterates over that array, which may not have the same side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment modifies `this._data` inside the loop, while the modified code fragment does not.

DONE.
