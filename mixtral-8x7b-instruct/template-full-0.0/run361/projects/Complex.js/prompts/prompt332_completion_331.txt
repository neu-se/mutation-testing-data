 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the special case for `b` equal to -1 would not be handled correctly, and the function might return an incorrect result or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b === this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true, and the special case for `b` equal to -1 would not be handled correctly, and the function might return an incorrect result or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be false, and the special case for `b` equal to -1 would not be handled correctly, and the function might return an incorrect result or throw an error.

DONE.
