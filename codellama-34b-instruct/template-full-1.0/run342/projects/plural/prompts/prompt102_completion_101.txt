  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function for adding the "ies" ending would be applied to these words even if they are not in the list of irregular words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/(s)$/, 'es') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function for adding the "es" ending would be applied to these words even if they are not in the list of irregular words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|
