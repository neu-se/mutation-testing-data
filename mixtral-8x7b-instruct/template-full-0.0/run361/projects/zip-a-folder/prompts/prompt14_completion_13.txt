 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `access` call would now check if the source directory has both write and read permissions, instead of just read permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `access` call would now check if the source directory has execute permissions, instead of read permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.S_IRUSR
```
This would result in different behavior because the `access` call would now check for the owner's read permission on the source directory, using the symbolic constant `S_IRUSR`, instead of checking for read permission using the `R_OK` constant.

DONE.
