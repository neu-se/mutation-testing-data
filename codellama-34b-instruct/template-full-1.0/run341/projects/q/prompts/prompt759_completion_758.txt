  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allSettled1", "allSettled2"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved`, `allSettled1`, and `allSettled2` are all distinct functions that have different implementations, and the buggy code fragment would result in different behavior if any of these functions were used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.allSettled, "Promise.allSettled", "Q.allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.allSettled`, `Q.allSettled`, and `allSettled` are all distinct functions that have different implementations, and the buggy code fragment would result in different behavior if any of these functions were used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.progress, "deferred.progress", "Q.progress"
```
This would result in different behavior because
