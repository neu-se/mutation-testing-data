  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q()` is a function that returns a new promise, whereas `Q.then` is a method that returns a promise based on the outcome of a previous promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function(){}, function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` takes two parameters, the second one being a rejection handler, whereas `Q()` only takes one parameter, which is the function to be executed.
