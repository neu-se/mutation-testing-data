  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to skip over the last operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the peeked operation in the other iterator, which could cause the code to skip over the last operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength()) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the minimum of the lengths of the peeked operations in both iterators, which could cause the code to skip over the last operation in both iterators.

DONE.
