  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` would be a non-void value, which would cause the `else` block to be executed. In the original code, `inspect` is a void value, so the `else` block is skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` would be a null value, which would cause the `else` block to be executed. In the original code, `inspect` is a non-null value, so the `else` block is skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` would be an undefined value, which would cause the `else` block to be executed. In the original code, `inspect` is a non-undefined value, so the `else` block is skipped.
