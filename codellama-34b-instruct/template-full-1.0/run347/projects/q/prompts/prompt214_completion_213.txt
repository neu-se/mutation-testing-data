```
isPromiseAlike(value) || value === "current"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `value === "current"` would allow passing the string "current" as a resolution value, which is not a promise and would not be caught by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow passing any function as a resolution value, regardless of whether it is a promise or not. However, it would not be able to pass `isPromiseAlike` as a resolution value, which is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value && isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `value &&` would allow passing falsy values as a resolution value, which would not be caught by the original code. However, it would not be able to pass `isPromise
