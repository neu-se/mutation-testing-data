  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromStream` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromSync` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

DONE.
