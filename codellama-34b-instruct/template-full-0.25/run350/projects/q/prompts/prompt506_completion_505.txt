  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive a `null` value instead of an array of arguments, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive an empty array instead of an array of arguments, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive an array of numbers instead of an array of arguments, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
