  Sure! Here are my responses:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iteration would start from the next index instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iteration would start from the previous index instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start from the beginning of the delta instead of the current index.

DONE.
