  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort + 1` is a number. This change would cause the `onAbort` function to be called with a different argument, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `!abort` is the negation of that value. This change would cause the `onAbort` function to be called with a different argument, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort === true` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `true` if `abort` is `true` and `false` otherwise
