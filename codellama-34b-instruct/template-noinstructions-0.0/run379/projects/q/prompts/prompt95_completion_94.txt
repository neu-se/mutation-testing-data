  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++ >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++index` operator would increment the `index` variable before the comparison, whereas the original code increments the `index` variable after the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `index` variable before the comparison, whereas the original code increments the `index` variable after the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the `length` variable before the comparison, whereas the original code increments the `index` variable after the comparison.

DONE.
