  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value, and the original code fragment `void 0` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value, and the original code fragment `void 0` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("oops")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("oops")` will throw an error, while the original code fragment `void 0` does not.

DONE.
