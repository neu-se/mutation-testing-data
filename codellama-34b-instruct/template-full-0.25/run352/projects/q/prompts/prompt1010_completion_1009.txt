  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to `nodeArgs.push()` instead of the first argument, which would cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument would be passed to `nodeArgs.push()` instead of the second argument, which would cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument would be passed to `nodeArgs.push()` instead of the second argument, which would cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
