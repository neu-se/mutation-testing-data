  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` would return the length of the string, while `this` would return the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `num + 1` would return a different number than `num`, which would affect the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string literal, while `this` and `num` are variables.

DONE.
