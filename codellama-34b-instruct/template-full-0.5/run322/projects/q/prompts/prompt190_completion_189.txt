  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `attempt2` array would be used instead of the third.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth element of the `attempt2` array would be used instead of the third.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fifth element of the `attempt2` array would be used instead of the third.

DONE.
