  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `ends.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve(null)` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, whereas `ends.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `ends.promise` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(ends.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve(ends.promise)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `ends.promise` property, whereas `ends.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `ends.promise` property.

DONE.
