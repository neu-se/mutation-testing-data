  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the keys of the object, while the modified code fragment returns the keys of the object's prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string representation of the object, while the modified code fragment returns the string representation of the object's prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the constructor function of the object, while the modified code fragment returns the constructor function of the object's prototype.

DONE.
