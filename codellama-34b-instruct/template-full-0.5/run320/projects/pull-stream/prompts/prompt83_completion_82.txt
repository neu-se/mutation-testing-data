  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `read` with `abort` and `done` if they were both truthy, but this replacement code fragment would call `read` with `abort` and `done` regardless of their truthiness.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `read` with `abort` and `done` if `abort` was truthy, but this replacement code fragment would call `read` with `abort` and `done` regardless of `abort`'s truthiness.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `read` with `abort` and `done` if `done`
