  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `fileNameAndLineNumber[0]` would be `undefined` if the array is empty or if the first element is `undefined`. In the original code, `!fileNameAndLineNumber` would evaluate to `true` if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an empty array or if the first element is `undefined`, which is not the desired behavior. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined`, the code would correctly check if the first element of the array is `undefined`, which is the desired behavior.

DONE.
