  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
[arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` refers to the function's arguments object, which contains all the arguments that were passed to the function, as opposed to the original code fragment which only passed the `name` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
[this, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the object that the function is bound to, and `1` is a new argument that is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
[this, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all the elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args.slice(1, 2)` returns a new array containing only the second element of `args`.

DONE.
