  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, regardless of the case of the letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, regardless of the presence or absence of a newline character at the end of the input string.
