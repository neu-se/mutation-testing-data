  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `apply` method would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an object is not a function, so the `apply` method would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an array is not a function, so the `apply` method would throw an error.

DONE.
