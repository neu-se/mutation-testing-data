  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.race` returns a promise that is resolved with the first of an array of promises to become settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of the resolved values from the promises in the provided array, whereas `Q.race` returns a promise that is resolved with the first of an array of promises to become settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` is used to create a new promise that is resolved with the return value of a callback function, whereas `Q.race` returns a promise that is resolved with the first of an array of promises to become settled.

DONE.
