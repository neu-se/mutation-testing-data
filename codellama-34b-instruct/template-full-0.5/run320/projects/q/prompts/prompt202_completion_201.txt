  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the index of the second line instead of the first line, which could lead to a different result in the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[lines.length - 1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the index of the last line instead of the first line, which could lead to a different result in the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[Math.floor(Math.random() * lines.length)].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the index of a random line instead of the first line, which could lead to a different result in the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function.

DONE.
