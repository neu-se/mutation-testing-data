  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the slice of the string starting from the second character, rather than the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the slice of the string starting from the last character, rather than the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the slice of the string starting from the first character, up to but not including the last character.

DONE.
