  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a null value as the first argument, which would likely cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an undefined value as the first argument, which would likely cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an empty object as the first argument, which would likely cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

DONE.
