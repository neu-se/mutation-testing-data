  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `call` method to bind the `this` context to the `hasOwnProperty` function, which would cause the function to always return `true` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(this, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `bind` method to bind the `this` context to the `hasOwnProperty` function, which would cause the function to always return `true` regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.apply(this, [prop])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `apply` method to bind the `this` context to the `hasOwnProperty` function, which would cause the function to always return
