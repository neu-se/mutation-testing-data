  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `options` object, causing the `fs.writeFileSync` function to always throw an error, even if the file exists and has the correct encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding = 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `encoding` property of the `options` object to `'utf8'`, which may cause the file to be read or written incorrectly if the actual encoding is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding = 'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `encoding` property of the `options` object to `'utf16'`, which may cause the file to be read or written incorrectly if the actual encoding is different.

DONE.
