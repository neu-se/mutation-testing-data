 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
flushing === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now strict, requiring `flushing` to be exactly equal to `false`. The original code uses a loose comparison, which would also be true if `flushing` is any falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(flushing)
