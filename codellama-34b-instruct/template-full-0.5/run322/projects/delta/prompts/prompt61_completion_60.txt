  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'function' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `attributes` is a function instead of an object, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `attributes` is a non-empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `attributes` is an object with no properties, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `attributes` is a non-empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `
