  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function instead of the `getCountry` function, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country.timezones[0].id]: getTimezone(country.timezones[0].id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first timezone of each country, instead of all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country.timezones.length]: getTimezone(country.timezones[0].id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first timezone of each country, and use the length of the `timezones` array instead of the ID of the timezone.

DONE.
