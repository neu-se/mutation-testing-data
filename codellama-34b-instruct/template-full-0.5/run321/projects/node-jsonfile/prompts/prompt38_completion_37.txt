  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback`, and it may not have the same behavior when it comes to handling errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not have the same behavior when it comes to handling errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not have the same behavior when it comes to handling errors.

DONE.
