  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for a promise and would cause an error when it is passed to `allResolved()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, which would cause the `allResolved()` function to immediately return a rejected promise, rather than waiting for all of the other promises to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all([]).then(() => {
    throw new Error();
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a promise that is resolved with an error, which would cause the `allResolved()` function to immediately return a rejected promise, rather than waiting for all of the other promises to be resolved.

DONE.
