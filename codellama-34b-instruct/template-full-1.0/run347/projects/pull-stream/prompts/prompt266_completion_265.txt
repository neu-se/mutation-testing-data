  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could lead to incorrect results in the restricted comparisons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as `data` is always equal to `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error, as `null` is not a valid value for the `data` parameter.

DONE.
