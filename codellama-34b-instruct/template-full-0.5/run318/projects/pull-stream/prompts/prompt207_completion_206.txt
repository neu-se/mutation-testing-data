  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and therefore would cause a type error when the `map` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and therefore would cause a type error when the `map` function is called.

DONE.
