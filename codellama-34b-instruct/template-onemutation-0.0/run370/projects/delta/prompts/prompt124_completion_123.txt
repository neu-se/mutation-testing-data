  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `hasNext` property of the `OpIterator` object, which is a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements to iterate over. In contrast, the buggy code fragment uses the `hasNext` method of the `OpIterator` object, which is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements to iterate over.

DONE.
