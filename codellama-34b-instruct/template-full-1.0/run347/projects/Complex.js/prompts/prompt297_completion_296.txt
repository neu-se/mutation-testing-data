  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.sinh() is not the same as Math.sin() and would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh(b * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.cosh() is not the same as Math.cos() and would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh(b * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.tanh() is not the same as Math.tan() and would produce a different result.

DONE.
