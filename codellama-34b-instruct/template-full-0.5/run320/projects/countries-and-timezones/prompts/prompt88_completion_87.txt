  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a different name than the one expected by the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"America/Los_Angeles"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a different name than the one expected by the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

DONE.
