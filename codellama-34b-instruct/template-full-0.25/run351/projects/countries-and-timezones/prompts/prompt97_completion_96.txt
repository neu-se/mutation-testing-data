  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone instead of the timezone object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).timezones[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first timezone in the `timezones` array instead of the timezone object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).timezones.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of timezones in the `timezones` array instead of the timezone object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
