  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean variable that controls whether unhandled rejections are tracked or not. By replacing `!trackUnhandledRejections` with `trackUnhandledRejections === false`, the code would only execute the `if` block if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`, which means that unhandled rejections are not being tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof trackUnhandledRejections === "boolean"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof trackUnhandledRejections` would return the type of `trackUnhandledRejections`, which is a boolean. By replacing `!trackUnhandledRejections` with `typeof trackUnhandledRejections === "boolean"`, the code would only execute the `if` block if `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean, which means that unhandled rejections are being tracked
