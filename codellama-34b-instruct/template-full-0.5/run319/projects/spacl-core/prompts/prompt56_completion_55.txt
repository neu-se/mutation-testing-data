  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/\*/g, '+')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of `*` with `+`, whereas the original code fragment only replaced the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/\+/g, '*')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of `+` with `*`, whereas the original code fragment only replaced the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[+*]/g, '+')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of `+` or `*` with `+`, whereas the original code fragment only replaced the first occurrence.

DONE.
