  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.concat(item)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array instead of modifying the existing one, which could cause the test case to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 0, item)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the existing array and could cause the test case to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the push operation would insert a different value into the array, which could cause the test case to fail.

DONE.
