  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the buffer before reporting it as corrupted, potentially masking the actual corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(buffer) ? buffer : buffer.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the buffer to a slice if it is not a buffer, which could cause the code to fail if the buffer is expected to be a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size > 0 ? buffer : buffer.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the buffer if the data size is greater than 0, potentially hiding the actual corruption.

DONE.
