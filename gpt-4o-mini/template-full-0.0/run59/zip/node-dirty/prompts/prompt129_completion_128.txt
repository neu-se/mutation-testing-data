Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `cork()` without any arguments, which is not the intended use of the method and could lead to unexpected behavior in the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes a boolean argument to `cork()`, which does not accept any parameters, potentially causing the method to behave incorrectly or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork('invalid');
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an invalid string argument to `cork()`, which is not expected and could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the stream handling.

DONE.
