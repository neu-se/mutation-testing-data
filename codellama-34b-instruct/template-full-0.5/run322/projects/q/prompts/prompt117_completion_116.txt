  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to return an array of numbers instead of an array of values from the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to always return the first element of the original array, regardless of the index passed to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_map` function to return an array of values from the original array, but with the values repeated multiple times.

DONE.
