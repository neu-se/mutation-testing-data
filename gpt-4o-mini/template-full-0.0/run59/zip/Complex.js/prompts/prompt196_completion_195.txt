Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the imaginary part being raised to the power, potentially altering the result of the complex exponentiation when `z['re']` is 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the imaginary part, which would affect the angle in the polar representation of the complex number, leading to a different result in the exponentiation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it halves the imaginary part, which would also change the angle in the polar representation, resulting in a different complex number after exponentiation.

DONE.
