  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a different base URL, which could potentially change the result of the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com/path"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a different base URL with a different path, which could potentially change the result of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com/path#fragment"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a different base URL with a different path and fragment, which could potentially change the result of the `parse` function.

DONE.
