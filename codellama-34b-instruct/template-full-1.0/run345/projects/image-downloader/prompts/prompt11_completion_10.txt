  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, while `path.basename` returns the base name of the given path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.resolve` would return an absolute path, while `path.basename` would return a relative path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse` would return an object with different properties than `path.basename`, which is a string containing the base name of the given path.

DONE.
