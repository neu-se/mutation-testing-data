  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`otherIter.length()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.length()` returns the number of ops in the `otherIter` iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the iterator, which may be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`thisIter.length()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.length()` returns the number of ops in the `thisIter` iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the `otherIter` iterator, which may be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`otherIter.peekLength()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the `otherIter` iterator, which may be different from the length of the `thisIter` iterator.

DONE.
