  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function has been negated, meaning that the `typeof input === 'object' && input !== null` check will be inverted, allowing non-object types to pass the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
points.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for a single-element array in the `if` statement would fail when `points` has more than one element, allowing the code to proceed with the calculation of the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` variable would be allowed to be negative, potentially causing the calculation of the distance and bearing to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
