 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof promise === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the promise instead of calling the `isPromise` function. It may pass for other objects with the same type but not having the same behavior as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the promise is an instance of Object, which is always true for any JavaScript object. This would bypass the actual check for a promise and might lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, regardless of the input. This would bypass the actual check for a promise and might lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
