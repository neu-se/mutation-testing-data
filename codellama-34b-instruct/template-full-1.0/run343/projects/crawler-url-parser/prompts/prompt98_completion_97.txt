  Option 1:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property exists on the object, whereas `has` checks if the value exists in the map.

Option 2:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the variable, whereas `get` returns the value associated with the key in the map, which may be `undefined` if the key does not exist.

Option 3:
```
urlMap.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` returns the number of elements in the map, whereas `has` checks if the map contains a specific key.

DONE.
