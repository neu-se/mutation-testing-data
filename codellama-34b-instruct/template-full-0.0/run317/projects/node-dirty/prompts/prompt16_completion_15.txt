  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the key-value pair from the queue, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.concat(this._queue.get(key)));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the callbacks with the existing list of callbacks for the key, whereas the original code would overwrite the existing list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.slice(0, -1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last callback from the list, whereas the original code would add the callback to the end of the list.

DONE.
