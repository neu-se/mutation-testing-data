Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"node_modules"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly filter out stack lines that contain the string "node_modules", potentially excluding relevant stack traces that should be included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(app.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider stack lines from a specific file "app.js", ignoring other relevant stack frames that may be important for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes("node.js")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method of checking for the presence of "node.js" from `indexOf` to `includes`, which could lead to different results in certain edge cases, especially if the stack line format changes.

DONE.
