  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fake
```
This would result in different behavior because `fake` is not a valid function, and calling it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = null
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `emit` to `null` would prevent the `emit` function from being called, which would break the functionality of the `_load` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.addEventListener
```
This would result in different behavior because `addEventListener` is not the same as `emit`, and passing a different function as a callback would change the behavior of the `_load` function.

DONE.
