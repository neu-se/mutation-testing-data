  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of substrings using the `undefined` separator, which would result in an array of single characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of substrings using the `null` separator, which would result in an array of single characters.

DONE.
