  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` property is not the same as the `arg` property, and would cause the code to calculate the absolute value of `a` instead of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not the same as the `a` variable, and would cause the code to use the value of `b` instead of `a` in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be performed on the sum of `a` and `b` instead of just `a`.

DONE.
