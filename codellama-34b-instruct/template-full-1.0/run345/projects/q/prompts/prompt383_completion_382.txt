  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` calls the callback function with the promise's inspected value, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` calls the callback function with the promise's inspected value, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` calls the callback function with the promise's inspected value, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with the promise itself.

DONE.
