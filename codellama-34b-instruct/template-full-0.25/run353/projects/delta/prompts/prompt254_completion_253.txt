  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the iterator by one step, even if the current operation is a retain or delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the number of characters retained in the current operation, rather than by one step.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the number of characters deleted in the current operation, rather than by one step.

DONE.
