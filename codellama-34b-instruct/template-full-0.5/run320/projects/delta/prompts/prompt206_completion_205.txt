  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new element into the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes an element from the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the delta.

DONE.
