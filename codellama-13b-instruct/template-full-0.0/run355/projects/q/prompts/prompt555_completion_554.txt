  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with the resolved value of the promise, whereas the `errback` function would be called with the rejected reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called with the rejected reason, whereas the `callback` function would be called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would be called with a new `Error` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error. The `callback` function would not be called in this case, and the `errback` function would be called with the rejected reason.

DONE.
