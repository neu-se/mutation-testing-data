```javascript
{ id: 'non-existent-country-id' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a hardcoded "country" object with a non-existent country ID instead of building a country object using the `buildCountry` function. This would cause issues if the test suite expects the `getCountry` function to return a specific structure for non-existent country IDs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `null` instead of building a country object using the `buildCountry` function. This would cause issues if the test suite expects the `getCountry` function to return a specific structure for non-existent country IDs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
buildCountry(data, 'non-existent-country-id')
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `buildCountry` function with a non-existent
