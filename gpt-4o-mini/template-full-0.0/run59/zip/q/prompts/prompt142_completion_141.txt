Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p = p && p.source;
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of the logical AND operator (`&&`) will assign `p.source` to `p` only if `promise` is truthy, potentially resulting in `p` being `undefined` if `promise` is falsy, whereas the original code always assigns `p.source` regardless of the truthiness of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p = p.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a property `value` on `p`, which may not exist, leading to `p` being `undefined` if `promise` does not have a `value` property, while the original code accesses `p.source`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p = p.source || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns an empty object to `p` if `p.source` is falsy, which means `p` will always be an object, whereas
