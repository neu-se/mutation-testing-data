```
return [fileName, Number(lineNumber) + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `true`, as the file name and line number would be different from the original values, which would make the `Q` function always return a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return [fileName, Number(lineNumber) - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `true`, as the file name and line number would be different from the original values, which would make the `Q` function always return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return [fileName, Number(lineNumber) % 2 === 0 ? Number(lineNumber) + 1 : Number(lineNumber) - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame`
