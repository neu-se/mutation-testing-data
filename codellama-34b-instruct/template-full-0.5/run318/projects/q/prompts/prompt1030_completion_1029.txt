  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value, while this new code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value, while this new code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value, while this new code fragment returns the value plus one.

DONE.
