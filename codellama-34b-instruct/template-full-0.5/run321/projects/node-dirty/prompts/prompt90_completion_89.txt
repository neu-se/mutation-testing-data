  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event instead of the expected event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different message than the expected event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different message than the expected event, and the message would be different from the one emitted by the original code.

DONE.
