  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a rejection handler, which would catch any potential errors and prevent them from being propagated to the `process.emit` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called with a rejection handler, which would catch any potential errors and prevent them from being propagated to the `process.emit` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is called with a callback that would be executed regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. This would prevent the `process.emit` call from being made in the case of a rejection.

DONE.
