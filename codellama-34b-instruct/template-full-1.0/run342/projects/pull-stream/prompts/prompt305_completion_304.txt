  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `null` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment called the `read` function with `ended` as the first argument. This could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently, depending on how it was implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(Math.random(ended), cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with a random number as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment called the `read` function with `ended` as the first argument. This could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently, depending on how it was implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(cb, ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `ended` variable as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment called
