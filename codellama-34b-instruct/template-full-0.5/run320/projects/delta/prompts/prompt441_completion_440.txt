  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it may return a different substring of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` takes an additional argument that specifies the starting position of the substring, which may cause the method to return a different substring than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(0, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` takes two arguments, the first one specifying the starting position of the substring and the second one specifying the length of the substring, which may cause the method to return a different substring than expected.

DONE.
