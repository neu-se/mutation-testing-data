 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, while `Q(promise).thenResolve` returns a new promise that is resolved with the same value as the input promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(value)
