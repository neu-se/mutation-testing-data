 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'type' in point && 'coordinates' in point
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of properties using the `in` operator instead of using `hasOwnProperty()`, which also checks if the properties are not inherited.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
point.type !== undefined && point.coordinates !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the properties are not `undefined` instead of checking if the object has the properties using `hasOwnProperty()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(point).length !== 2 || point.coordinates.length !== 2
