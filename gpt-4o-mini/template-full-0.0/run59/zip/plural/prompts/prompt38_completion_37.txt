Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indeks/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "index" is misspelled as "indeks," causing the rule to not match the correct pluralization for "index."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `|s$` would match any word ending with 's', which could lead to incorrect pluralization for words that should not follow this rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `|y$` would incorrectly match any word ending with 'y', which could lead to incorrect pluralization for words that should not be affected by this rule.

DONE.
