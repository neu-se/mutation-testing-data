  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, arguments.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `array_slice` function, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the last one to the `array_slice` function, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first and last one to the `array_slice` function, instead of passing all the arguments.

DONE.
