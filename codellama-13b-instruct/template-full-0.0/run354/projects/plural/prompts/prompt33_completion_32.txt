  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the string, while the `substr` method returns a substring of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a substring of the string, while the `substr` method returns a substring of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method returns a substring of the string, while the `substring` method returns a substring of the string.

DONE.
