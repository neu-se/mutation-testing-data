  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to only iterate over the first element of the `other` Delta's ops, rather than iterating over all of the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to only iterate over the second element of the `other` Delta's ops, rather than iterating over all of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to only iterate over the `length` element of the `other` Delta's ops, rather than iterating over all of the elements.

DONE.
