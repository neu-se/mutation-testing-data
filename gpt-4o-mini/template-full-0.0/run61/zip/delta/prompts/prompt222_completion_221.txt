Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the first string to uppercase, potentially altering the comparison logic in the `diff` function, leading to incorrect diff results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1] + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends "extra" to the second string, which would change the content being compared and could lead to mismatches in the diff results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character from the first string, which could affect the equality checks and the overall diffing process, potentially causing incorrect diffs.

DONE.
