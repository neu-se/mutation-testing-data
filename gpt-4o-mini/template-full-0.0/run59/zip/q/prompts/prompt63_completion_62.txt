Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
document, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the global `window` object to the `document` object, which may lead to issues if `setImmediate` relies on the `window` context for execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window, runSingle
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function being called from `flush` to `runSingle`, which would cause the wrong function to be executed, potentially leading to unhandled tasks and incorrect task management.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the context to `null`, which may cause `setImmediate` to fail or behave unexpectedly, as it would not have a valid context to bind to, leading to potential errors or no execution of the `flush` function.

DONE.
