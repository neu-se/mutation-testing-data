  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the next value in the iterator, whereas `iter.next` would return the next function in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(2)` would skip the next two values in the iterator and return the third value, whereas `iter.next` would return the next value without skipping any.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(function(value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(function(value) { return value * 2; })` would return the next value in the iterator, multiplied by 2, whereas `iter.next` would return the next value without modification.

DONE.
