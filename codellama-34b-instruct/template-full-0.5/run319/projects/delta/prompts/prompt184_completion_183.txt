  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the `retain` property as a string, even if it is not a string. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `retain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the `retain` property as an object, even if it is not an object. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the `retain` property as undefined, even if it is not undefined. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `retain`
