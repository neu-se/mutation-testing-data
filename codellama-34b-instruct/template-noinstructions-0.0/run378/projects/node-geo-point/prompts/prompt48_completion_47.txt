  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(φ1)` is used to convert the latitude of the first point to radians, while `deg2rad(φ2)` would convert the latitude of the second point to radians, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg(φ1)` is used to convert the latitude of the first point to degrees, while `rad2deg(φ2)` would convert the latitude of the second point to degrees, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(λ1)` is used to convert the longitude of the first point to radians,
