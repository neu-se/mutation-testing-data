Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` computes the natural logarithm of a number, which is fundamentally different from the exponential function `Math.exp`, leading to incorrect results in the calculation of hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of an angle, which is not related to the hyperbolic cosine function, thus producing entirely incorrect results for the intended computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which does not perform the exponential operation, leading to incorrect calculations in the context of hyperbolic functions.

DONE.
