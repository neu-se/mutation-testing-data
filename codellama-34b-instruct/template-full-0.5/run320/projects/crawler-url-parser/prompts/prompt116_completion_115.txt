  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the base URL from the map, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the base URL to null in the map, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the base URL to the parsed URL, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
