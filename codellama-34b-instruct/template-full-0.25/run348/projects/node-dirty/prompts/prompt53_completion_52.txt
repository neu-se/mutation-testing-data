  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty or if there are in-flight writes, while this new code fragment only checks if the queue is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are any in-flight writes, while this new code fragment checks if there are more than one in-flight writes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty or if there are in-flight writes, while this new code fragment checks if the queue size is greater than 10.

DONE.
