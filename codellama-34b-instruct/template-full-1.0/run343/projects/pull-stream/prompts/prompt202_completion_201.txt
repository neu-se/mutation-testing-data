  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a variable that is set to the value of `abort` if `abort` is called, and would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid argument for the `read` function, but would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument than expected.

DONE.
