  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause security vulnerabilities if the URL being requested is not secure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `ftp` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause errors if the URL being requested is not an FTP server.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `file` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause errors if the URL being requested is not a file.

DONE.
