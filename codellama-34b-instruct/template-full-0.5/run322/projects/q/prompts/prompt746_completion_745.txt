  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `onProgress` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is fulfilled, whereas `onProgress` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, whereas `onProgress` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress.

DONE.
