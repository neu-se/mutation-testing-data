  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and will not have a `then` method, unlike `void 0` which is a function that returns `undefined`. This means that the promise returned by `Q(object)` will not be able to call the `then` method on `null`, leading to a different execution path.
