  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `buffer` with the arguments `0` and `-1`, which would return a new string that is one character shorter than the original `buffer`. This would cause the error message to be different than the original code, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method is called on `buffer`, which would return a new string with all characters in uppercase. This would cause the error message to be different than the original code, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end
