 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred.resolve would be changed to deferred.reject, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved with the result of the dispatched method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred.resolve would be changed to deferred.promise, causing the promise to always resolve to the same value (the promise itself) instead of the result of the dispatched method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred.resolve would be changed to Math.random, causing the promise to resolve to a random value instead of the result of the dispatched method.

DONE.
