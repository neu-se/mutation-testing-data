  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter would be incremented by 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `splice` method to insert the new element at the wrong position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with an additional argument, which would cause it to insert two new elements instead of one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with an additional argument, which would cause it to insert the `insert` property of the `newOp` object instead of the `newOp` object itself.

DONE.
