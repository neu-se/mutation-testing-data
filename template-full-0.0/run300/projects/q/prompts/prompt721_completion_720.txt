Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method is called with the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior. The `deferred.notify()` method should be called
