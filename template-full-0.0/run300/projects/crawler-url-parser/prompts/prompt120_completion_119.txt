  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base URL of the current URL, which may not be the same as the base URL passed to the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current URL of the base URL, which may not be the same as the current URL passed to the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base URL of the base URL, which may not be the same as the base URL passed to the `gettype` function.

DONE.
