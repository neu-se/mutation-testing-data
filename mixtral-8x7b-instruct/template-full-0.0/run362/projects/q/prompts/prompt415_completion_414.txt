 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is an object and not null, instead of just checking if it is an instance of Promise. This could lead to treating non-promise objects with a `then` method as promises, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is an instance of `Object` instead of `Promise`. This could lead to treating any object with a `then` method as a promise, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check if `value` is an instance of Promise, and only checks if `value` exists and
