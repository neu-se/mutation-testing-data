  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|fungus|cactus|focus|syllabus/gi, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag has been added to the regex, which makes the match case-insensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|fungus|cactus|focus|syllabus/g, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'u' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the last character of the matched word is replaced with 'u' instead of 'i'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|fungus|cactus|focus|syllabus|chorus/g, function(w) { return w.substr(0
