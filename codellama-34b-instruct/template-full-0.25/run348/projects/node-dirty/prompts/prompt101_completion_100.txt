  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the original code fragment checks for the presence of a value while this new code fragment checks for the presence of a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a value while this new code fragment checks for the presence of a specific string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a value while this new code fragment checks for the presence of the `undefined` value using the `void` operator.

DONE.
