  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, arguments])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `post` method to be called with the `name` and `arguments` as arguments, rather than the `name` and `args` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to be called with the `name` and `args` as arguments, rather than the `name` and `args` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called with the `name` and `args` as arguments, rather than the `name` and `args` as in the original code.

DONE.
