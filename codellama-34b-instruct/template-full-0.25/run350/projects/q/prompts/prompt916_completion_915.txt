  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `null`, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with an error, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`.

DONE.
