  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len <= pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the less-than operator, which would return `false` if the subdomain lengths are equal. However, the replacement code uses the less-than-or-equal-to operator, which would return `true` if the subdomain lengths are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len > pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the less-than operator, which would return `false` if the subdomain lengths are equal. However, the replacement code uses the greater-than operator, which would return `true` if the subdomain lengths are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len !== pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the less-than operator,
