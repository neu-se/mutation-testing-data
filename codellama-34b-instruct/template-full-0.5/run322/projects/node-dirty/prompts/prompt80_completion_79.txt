  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is an error object that is passed to the `error` event listener, while `null` is a null value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is an error object that is passed to the `error` event listener, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is an error object that is passed to the `error` event listener, while `new Error()` creates a new error object with a default message.

DONE.
