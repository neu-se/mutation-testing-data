  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is expected to call the `rejected` callback when the promise is rejected, but `_fulfilled` would be called instead, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is expected to call the `rejected` callback when the promise is rejected, but `_progressed` would be called instead, which could cause the promise to make progress unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is expected to call the `rejected` callback with the rejection reason, but `_rejected(new Error())` would be called instead, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

DONE.
