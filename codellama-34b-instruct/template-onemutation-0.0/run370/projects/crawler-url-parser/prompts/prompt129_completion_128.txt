  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` argument to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code fragment. This would cause the `parse` function to use the `baseUrlStr` as the base URL for parsing the `pageurl`, which would result in a different URL being returned.
