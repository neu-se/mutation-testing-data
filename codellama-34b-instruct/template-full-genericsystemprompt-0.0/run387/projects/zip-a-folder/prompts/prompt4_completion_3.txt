  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while this new code fragment checks if it is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while this new code fragment
