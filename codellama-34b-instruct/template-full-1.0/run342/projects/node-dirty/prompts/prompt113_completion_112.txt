  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `load` event with the value of `this._data.size`, which is the number of entries in the database, whereas this modified code always emits `0` as the value of the `load` event.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `load` event with the number of entries in the database, whereas this modified code always emits one more than the number of entries in the database as the value of the `load` event.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `load`
