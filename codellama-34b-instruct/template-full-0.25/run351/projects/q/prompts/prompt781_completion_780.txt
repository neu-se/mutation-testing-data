  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless()
```
This would result in different behavior because `regardless` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `regardless` is a variable that refers to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.regardless()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.regardless()` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `regardless` is a variable that refers to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.regardless()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.regardless()` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `regardless` is a variable that refers to a function.

DONE.
