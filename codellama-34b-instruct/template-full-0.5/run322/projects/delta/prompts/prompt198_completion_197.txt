  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first op in the delta's ops array with the new op, rather than the last op as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp, delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the new op with the last op in the delta's ops array, rather than the first op as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second-to-last op in the delta's ops array with the new op, rather than the last op as in the original code.

DONE.
