  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverCountry` returns a country object, while the replaced code fragment `return null` returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverCountry` returns a country object, while the replaced code fragment `return undefined` returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverCountry` returns a country object, while the replaced code fragment `return 'foo'` returns a string.

DONE.
