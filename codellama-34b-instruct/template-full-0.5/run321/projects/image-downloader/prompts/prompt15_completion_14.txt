  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.join` joins two or more path segments together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the base name of a path, whereas `path.join` joins two or more path segments together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the extension of a path, whereas `path.join` joins two or more path segments together.

DONE.
