  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```dateStr.split("T")[0] + "/" + dateStr.split("T")[1];```
This would result in different behavior because it is breaking the date string into two parts and then concatenating them with a slash, whereas the original code was using the date string as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```dateStr.split("-")[0] + "/" + dateStr.split("-")[1];```
This would result in different behavior because it is breaking the date string into two parts and then concatenating them with a slash, whereas the original code was using the date string as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```dateStr.substring(0, 10) + "/" + dateStr.substring(11);```
This would result in different behavior because it is extracting the first 10 characters of the date string as the year-month-day part, and then extracting the last 3 characters as the time part
