  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property would be accessed with a different argument, which could cause the property to return a different value.

DONE.
