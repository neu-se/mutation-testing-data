  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values, while `Object.keys` returns an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, while `Object.keys` returns an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties), while `Object.keys` only returns an array of enumerable properties.

DONE.
