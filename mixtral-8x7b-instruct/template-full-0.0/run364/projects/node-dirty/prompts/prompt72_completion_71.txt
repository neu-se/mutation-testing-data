 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the number `0`, while this change uses `null`. The `load` event may now have a different meaning, depending on how the event handler is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unload'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the string `'load'`, while this change uses the string `'unload'`. This would cause the event listener to not be executed if it is listening for the `'load'` event, as the event name is now different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the number `0`, while this change uses the value of `this._data.size`. This could cause the event handler to receive a different value than expected, depending on the current size of the `_
