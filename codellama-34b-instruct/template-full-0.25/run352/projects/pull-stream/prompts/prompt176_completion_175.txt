  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `array` variable as an object, while the new code fragment is using `array.length` which is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `array` variable as an object, while the new code fragment is using `array[0]` which is the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `array` variable as an object, while the new code fragment is using `array.slice(1)` which is a new array containing all the elements of the original array except the first one.

DONE.
