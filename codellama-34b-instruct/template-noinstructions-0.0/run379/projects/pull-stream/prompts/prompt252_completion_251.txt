  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `nextChunk()` if `_read` is truthy and has a length greater than 0, whereas the original code would call `nextChunk()` if `_read` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `nextChunk()` if `_read` is truthy and has a length of 0, whereas the original code would call `nextChunk()` if `_read` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `nextChunk()` if `_read` is truthy and has a length greater than 1, whereas the original code would call `nextChunk()` if `_read` is truthy.
