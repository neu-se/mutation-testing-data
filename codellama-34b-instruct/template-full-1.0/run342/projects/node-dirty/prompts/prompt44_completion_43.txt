  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.get(key, updater(this.get(key)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called twice, which could lead to a different value being passed to the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called instead of the `get` method, which could lead to different behavior when the `cb` argument is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.update(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method is called instead of the `set` method, which could lead to different behavior when the `cb` argument is not `undefined`.

DONE.
