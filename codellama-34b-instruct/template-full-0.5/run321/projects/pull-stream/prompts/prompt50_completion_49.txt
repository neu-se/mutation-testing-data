  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s == 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if a value is a function, while the `==` operator checks if two values are equal. In this case, `s` might not be a function, but the string `"function"`, which would make the condition `true` even if `s` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object is a reference to the function that created the object, and the `Function` constructor is a built-in function in JavaScript that creates new functions. In this case, `s` might not be a function, but the `constructor` property of `s` might be set to the `Function` constructor, which would make the condition `true` even if `s` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.prototype.constructor === Function
