  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { insert: lastOp.insert - newOp.insert };
```
This would result in different behavior because the insert operation will now subtract the newOp instead of adding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain - newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because the retain operation will now subtract the newOp instead of adding it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { delete: lastOp.delete - newOp.delete };
```
This would result in different behavior because the delete operation will now subtract the newOp instead of adding it.

DONE.
