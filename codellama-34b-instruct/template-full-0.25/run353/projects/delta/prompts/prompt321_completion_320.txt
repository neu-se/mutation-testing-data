  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.retain` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.retain` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.retain` is undefined.
