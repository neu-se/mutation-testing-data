  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data + 1` is a number. This change would cause the test to fail if the input data is a string, as it would not match the expected output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data.toUpperCase()` is a string with all characters in uppercase. This change would cause the test to fail if the input data is a string with lowercase characters, as it would not match the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data.split('')` is an array of strings, each containing a single character from the original string. This change would cause the test to
