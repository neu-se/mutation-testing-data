  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return `undefined` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(object);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return the `object` itself instead of the expected object.

DONE.
