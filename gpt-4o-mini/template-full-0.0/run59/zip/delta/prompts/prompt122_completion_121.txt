Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the entire operation object to only the `insert` property, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations when the operation does not have an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the calculation to use the `delete` property instead of the entire operation object, which could lead to incorrect length results when the operation is not a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the actual length calculation with a constant value of `0`, which would always return a length of zero regardless of the actual operations present in the `ops` array.

DONE.
