/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/i
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match across multiple lines, so the pattern would also match if the string
