  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `ended`, so if `ended` is originally `true`, the updated code would pass `false` to the `cb` function, whereas the original code would pass `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if either `ended` or `cb` is truthy, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` if both are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate to `true` if both `ended` and `cb` are truthy, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true` if either is truthy.

DONE.
