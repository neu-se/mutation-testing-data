  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(?:\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would not match the same strings as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\(\\d+\\):\\(\\d+\\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would not match the same strings as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would not match the same strings as the original code.

DONE.
