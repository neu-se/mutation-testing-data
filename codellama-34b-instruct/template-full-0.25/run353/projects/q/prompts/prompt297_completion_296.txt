  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always return `x`, regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to return a value that is different from `x` and `y`, which would cause the `join` method to reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to return a value that is different from `x` and `y`, which would cause the `join` method to reject the promise.

DONE.
