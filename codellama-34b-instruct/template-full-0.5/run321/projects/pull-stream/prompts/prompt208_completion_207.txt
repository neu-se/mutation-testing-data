  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a reference to the `aborted` variable, which is a boolean value. Replacing it with `null` would change the behavior of the code, as it would no longer be checking the value of the `aborted` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would also result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `aborted`, which is a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a different value than `aborted`, which is a boolean value.

DONE.
