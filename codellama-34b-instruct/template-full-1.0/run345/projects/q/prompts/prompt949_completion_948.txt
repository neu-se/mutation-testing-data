  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`callback.call()`. This would result in different behavior because `call()` will not treat the first argument as the callback context if it is not a function, whereas `apply()` will do so if the first argument is not nullish. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`callback.bind(thisp)`. This would result in different behavior because `bind()` will return a new function that is bound to `thisp` whereas `apply()` applies the function to `thisp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`callback.bind.apply(void 0, nodeArgs)`. This would result in different behavior because bind will not get bound to the context in both cases but it will get executed later, applying the context to `thisp`.

DONE.
