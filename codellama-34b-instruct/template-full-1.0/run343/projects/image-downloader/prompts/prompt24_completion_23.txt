  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` refers to the source file path, whereas `options.dest` refers to the destination file path. By using `options.src` instead of `options.dest`, the code would be using the source file path as the destination file path, which would likely cause issues with the file being written to the correct location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.filename` refers to the filename of the file being written, whereas `options.dest` refers to the destination file path. By using `options.filename` instead of `options.dest`, the code would be using the filename of the file being written as the destination file path, which would likely cause issues with the file being written to the correct location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.tempDir
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.tempDir` refers
