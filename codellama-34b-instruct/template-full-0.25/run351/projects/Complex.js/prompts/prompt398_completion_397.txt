  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = -this['im'];
this['im'] = tmp;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code swaps the real and imaginary parts, while this code fragment only swaps the real part with the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = this['im'];
this['im'] = tmp;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code swaps the real and imaginary parts, while this code fragment only swaps the real part with the imaginary part.

DONE.
