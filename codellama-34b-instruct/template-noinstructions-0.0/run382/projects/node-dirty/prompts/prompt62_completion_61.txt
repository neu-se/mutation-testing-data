  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to be closed and any pending writes to be discarded. This would result in data loss and would likely cause errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to be closed and any pending writes to be flushed. However, the `destroy` method is also called, which would cause the stream to be closed and any pending writes to be discarded. This would result in data loss and would likely cause errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error')));
```
