  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1').toLowerCase()}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the captured group to lowercase, which could cause the match to fail in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1').slice(0, 1)}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only capture the first character of the match, which could cause the match to fail in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1').split('').reverse().join('')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the captured group, which could cause the match to fail in some cases.

DONE.
