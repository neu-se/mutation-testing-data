 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `_writeStream.uncork()` call from being reached, causing the stream to stop writing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_flush` function to always return, preventing any further writes to the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_flush` function to only iterate through the queue once, potentially leaving some data unwritten.

DONE.
