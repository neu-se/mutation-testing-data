  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the loop to skip over operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation in the this iterator, potentially causing the loop to include operations that should not be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the next operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the loop to include operations that should not be included.

DONE.
