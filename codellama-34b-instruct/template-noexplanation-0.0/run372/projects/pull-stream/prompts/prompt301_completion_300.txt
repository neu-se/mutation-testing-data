  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This change will cause the `ended` variable to be set to the opposite of the `end` parameter, which will result in the `read` function being called with the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && false
```
This change will cause the `ended` variable to be set to `false` regardless of the value of the `end` parameter, which will result in the `read` function being called with the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || false
```
This change will cause the `ended` variable to be set to `true` if the `end` parameter is `true`, and `false` otherwise, which will result in the `read` function being called with the wrong value.

DONE.
