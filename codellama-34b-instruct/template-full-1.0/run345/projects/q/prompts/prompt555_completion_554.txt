  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its second argument, but `null` is a non-promise value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its second argument, but `undefined` is not a promise value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its second argument, but `true` is a Boolean value, not a promise value.

DONE.
