  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would return `true` if the two values are not equal, whereas `isEqual` would return `false` in the same scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a strict inequality operator, whereas `isEqual` is a non-strict equality operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual(a[key], b[key])` would return `true` if the two values are not equal, whereas `isEqual` would return `false` in the same scenario.

DONE.
