  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the `d` variable, which is then used to calculate the `a` and `b` variables. By adding 1 to `b`, the value of `d` will be different, and the resulting `a` and `b` values will also be different, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the `d` variable, which is then used to calculate the `a` and `b` variables. By subtracting 1 from `b`, the value of `d` will be different, and the resulting `a` and `b` values will also be different, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
