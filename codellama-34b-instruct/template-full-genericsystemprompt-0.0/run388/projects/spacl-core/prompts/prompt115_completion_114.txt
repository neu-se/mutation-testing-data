  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while the original code fragment returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(verb => verb !== 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the original code fragment returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.map(verb => verb.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on each element of the original array, while the original code fragment returns the original array.

DONE.
