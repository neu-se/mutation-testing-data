  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\t' is a tab character instead of a newline, so the row split would be different and the JSON parsing would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because '\r' is a carriage return character instead of a newline, so the row split would be different and the JSON parsing would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON parsing would fail because the row split would be unable to split the data into rows.

DONE.
