Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to ignore the first argument passed to it, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when the function is called with multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the total number of arguments received instead of the arguments themselves, which would not be valid for the intended use of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the function, ignoring any additional arguments, which could lead to unexpected results when the function expects multiple arguments.

DONE.
