  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which would clone the `rule` object and pass the result of the `clone()` method as the second argument to the `Policy` constructor. However, the new code fragment `rule.clone(null)` would pass `null` as the second argument to the `Policy` constructor, which would result in a different object being created.

DONE.
