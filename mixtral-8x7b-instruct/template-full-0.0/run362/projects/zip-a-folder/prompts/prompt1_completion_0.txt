 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
o.compression < COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the compression level is less than uncompressed, which is never true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
o.compression = COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the compression level to medium instead of checking for uncompressed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed === o.compression
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an equality check with the `uncompressed` constant instead of referencing the `o.compression` property.

DONE.
