  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the second parameter of the `directory` method is a boolean flag indicating whether to include the directory itself in the archive, while the original code fragment used `false` to exclude the directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some/other/path", false
```
This would result in different behavior because the first parameter of the `directory` method is the path to the directory to archive, while the original code fragment used the `src` variable to specify the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "/**", false
```
This would result in different behavior because the first parameter of the `directory` method is the path to the directory to archive, while the original code fragment used the `src` variable to specify the path. The `**` glob pattern matches any path inside the directory, while the original code fragment did not use any glob patterns.

DONE.
