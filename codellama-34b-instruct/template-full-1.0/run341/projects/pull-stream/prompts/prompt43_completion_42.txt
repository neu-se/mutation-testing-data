  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `args` array to an empty array, potentially causing the `pull` function to fail if it relies on the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `args` array to `null`, potentially causing the `pull` function to throw an error if it assumes that `args` is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref = function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `args` array to a function, potentially causing the `pull` function to fail if it expects an array.

DONE.
