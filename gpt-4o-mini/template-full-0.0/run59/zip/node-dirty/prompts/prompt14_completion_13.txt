Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the callback to the beginning of the list instead of the end, which may change the order in which callbacks are executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `null` value to the callbacks list instead of the actual callback function, which would lead to a failure when trying to invoke it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the key as a callback instead of the actual callback function, which would cause the program to attempt to call a string (the key) as a function, resulting in a runtime error.

DONE.
