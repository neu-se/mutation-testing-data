  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method uses regex as its first argument. The `\\` escape sequence is an invalid regex, so it would cause the code to throw a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method does not remove the leading slash when the replacement string is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method removes the leading slash when the replacement string is an empty string.

DONE.
