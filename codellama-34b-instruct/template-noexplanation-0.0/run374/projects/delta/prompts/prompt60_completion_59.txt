  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `arg`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === 0
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `arg`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `arg`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
