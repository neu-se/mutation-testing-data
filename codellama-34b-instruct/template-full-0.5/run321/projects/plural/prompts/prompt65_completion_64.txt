```
'bacterium', 'bacteriums'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo and the word "bacteria" is not the plural form of "bacterium".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo and the word "bacteria" is not the plural form of "bacterium".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo and the word "bacterium" is not the plural form of "bacterium".
