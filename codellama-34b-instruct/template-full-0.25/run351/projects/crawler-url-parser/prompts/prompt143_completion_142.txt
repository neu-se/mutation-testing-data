  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `replace` method is different from the original code, which could lead to a different result when the method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `replace` method is different from the original code, which could lead to a different result when the method is called.
