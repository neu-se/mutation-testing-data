  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) * Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a)` is different from `Math.sqrt(a)` and would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(a)` and `Math.sin(b)` are different from `Math.sqrt(a)` and would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / Math.sqrt(a)` is different from `Math.sqrt(a)` and would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
