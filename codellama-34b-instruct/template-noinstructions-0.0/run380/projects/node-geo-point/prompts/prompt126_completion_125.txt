  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the method to return `null` instead of the expected `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the method to return `undefined` instead of the expected `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, but replacing it with a new `GeoPoint` object with latitude and longitude values of 0 would cause the method to return a different `GeoPoint` object than the expected one.
