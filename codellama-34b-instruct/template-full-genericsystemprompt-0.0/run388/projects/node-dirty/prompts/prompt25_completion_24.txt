  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a `null` argument, rather than being passed as an argument to `setImmediate`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an error argument, rather than being passed as an argument to `setImmediate`.

DONE.
