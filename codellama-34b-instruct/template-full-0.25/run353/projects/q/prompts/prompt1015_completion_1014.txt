  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push` line to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specific context, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push` line to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the function with a specific context and arguments, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push` line to fail.

DONE.
