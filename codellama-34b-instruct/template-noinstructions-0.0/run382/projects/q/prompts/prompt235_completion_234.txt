  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is an array of arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, and replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is an array of arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, and replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive a `null` value as its first argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is an array of arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to receive no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
