  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` would be called with `false` instead of `end`, which could lead to the `onEnd` callback being called unnecessarily.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` would be called with `true` instead of `end`, which could lead to the `onEnd` callback being called with a different argument than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once()
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` would be called without any argument, which could lead to the `onEnd` callback being called with an unexpected argument.

DONE.
