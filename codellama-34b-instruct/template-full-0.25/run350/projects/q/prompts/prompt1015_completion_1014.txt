  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with no arguments, whereas in the original code it is called with the `deferred` object as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called with no arguments, whereas in the original code it is called with the `deferred` object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called with no arguments, whereas in the original code it is called with the `deferred` object as an argument.

DONE.
