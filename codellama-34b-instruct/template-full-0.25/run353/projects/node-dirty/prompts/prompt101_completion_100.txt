  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `row.val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `row.val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is either `undefined` or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `row.val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is falsy (i.e., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string).

DONE.
