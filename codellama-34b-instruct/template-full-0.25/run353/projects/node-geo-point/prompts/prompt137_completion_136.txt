  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adjusts the longitude value to the specified precision, but this new code fragment adds 1 to the adjusted longitude value, which would result in a different geographic location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adjusts the latitude value to the specified precision, but this new code fragment subtracts 1 from the adjusted latitude value, which would result in a different geographic location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adjusts the longitude value to the specified precision, but this new code fragment multiplies the adjusted longitude value by 2, which would result in a different geographic location.

DONE.
