  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `cb` function as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment passed `cb` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(onAbort, abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `onAbort` function as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment passed `cb` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with `null` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment passed `cb` as the first argument.

DONE.
