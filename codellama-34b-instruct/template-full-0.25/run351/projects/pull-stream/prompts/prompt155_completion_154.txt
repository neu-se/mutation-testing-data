  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the arguments in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, null, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value has been added as the second argument, which could potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle `null` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value has been added as the third argument, which could potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle `null` values.

DONE.
