  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the number in the case where the number is odd, whereas the original code fragment only adds a negative sign when the number is even.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '' : '-') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only adds a negative sign when the number is even, whereas the original code fragment negates the number when the number is odd.
