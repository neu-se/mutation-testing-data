 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of invoking an empty object, which is undefined, instead of calling the `inspect` method on the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately access the `state` property of the promise's internal state, instead of returning the `inspect` method itself, which allows for further method chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `then` method of the promise, instead of the `inspect` method, which could lead to unexpected behavior when chaining methods or handling the promise.

DONE.
