  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is a sine function, which would give a different output than `cosm1`, which is a cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` is a square root function, which would give a different output than `cosm1`, which is a cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI + b` is a constant value plus a variable, which would give a different output than `cosm1`, which is a cosine function.

DONE.
