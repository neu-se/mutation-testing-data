  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String(error)` would resolve the promise with the string representation of the error, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object.

DONE.
