 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the filename has no extension, instead of checking if it has an extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.includes('.') === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the dest string contains a dot (any character), instead of checking if it has a file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.basename(options.dest).includes('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the base name of the dest string does not contain a dot (any character), instead of checking if it has a file extension.

DONE.
