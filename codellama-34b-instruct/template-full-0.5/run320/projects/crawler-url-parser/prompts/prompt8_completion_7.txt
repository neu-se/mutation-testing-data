  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, regardless of the input string, which would cause the `parse` function to return `null` for any input that contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if the input string does not contain illegal characters, and `false` otherwise, which would cause the `parse` function to return `null` for any input that contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if both the input string and the `baseUrlStr` contain illegal characters, and `false` otherwise, which would cause the `parse`
