  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` and `args` variables are not defined in the context of the `post` method, and would likely cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array by concatenating the `args` array with an empty array, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

DONE.
