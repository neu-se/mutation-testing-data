  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && abort` is a logical AND operation, whereas `err || abort` is a logical OR operation. In the original code, if `err` is truthy, the function will return `abort`. In the mutated code, if `err` is truthy and `abort` is truthy, the function will return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err || abort` is a logical OR operation, whereas `err || abort` is a logical AND operation. In the original code, if `err` is falsy, the function will return `abort`. In the mutated code, if `err` is falsy or `abort` is truthy, the function will return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because
