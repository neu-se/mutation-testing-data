  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.PI is a constant value of approximately 3.14159, whereas φ1 is a variable that represents the latitude of the point. Using Math.PI instead of φ1 would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because λ1 is the longitude of the point, whereas φ1 is the latitude. Using λ1 instead of φ1 would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because cos(φ1) is a different function than φ1. The cosine function has a different range of values than the function φ1, which would result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
