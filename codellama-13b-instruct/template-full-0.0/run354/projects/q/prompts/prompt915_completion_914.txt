  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred with the value of the `error` variable, while the modified code fragment resolves the deferred with no value. This could cause issues if the code relies on the deferred being resolved with a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the deferred with the value of the `error` variable, while the modified code fragment rejects the deferred with no value. This could cause issues if the code relies on the deferred being rejected with a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment notifies the deferred with no value, while the modified code fragment notifies the deferred with the value of the `error` variable. This could cause issues
