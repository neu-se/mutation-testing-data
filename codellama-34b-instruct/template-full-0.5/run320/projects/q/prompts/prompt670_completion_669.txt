  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 1))]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing it to behave differently.

DONE.
