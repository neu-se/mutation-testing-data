  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `arguments` object had more than two elements, while this replacement code fragment checks if it has more than one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `arguments` object had more than two elements, while this replacement code fragment checks if it has zero elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `arguments` object had more than two elements, while this replacement code fragment checks if its length is even.

DONE.
