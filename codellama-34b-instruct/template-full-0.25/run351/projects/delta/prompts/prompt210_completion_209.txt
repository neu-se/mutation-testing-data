  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the beginning, while this new code fragment slices it from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the beginning, while this new code fragment slices it from the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the beginning, while this new code fragment slices it from the first element to the second element.

DONE.
