  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string with the specified portion of the original string, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method returns a new string with all the characters in the original string converted to uppercase, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods return a new string with the characters in the original string rearranged, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
