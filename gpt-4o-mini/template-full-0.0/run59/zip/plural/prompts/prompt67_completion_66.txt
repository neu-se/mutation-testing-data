Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "memo" is "memos," but "memoses" is not a valid pluralization, which would lead to incorrect results when pluralizing "memo."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a duplicate rule for "memo," which could lead to unexpected behavior if the rules are processed in a certain order, potentially causing the function to return the wrong pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'message'
```
This would result in different behavior because "message" does not relate to "memo" in terms of pluralization rules, and thus would not trigger the intended pluralization logic for "memo," leading to a fallback behavior instead.

DONE.
