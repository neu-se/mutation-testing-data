  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, and the code would only execute when `a` is equal to 0, rather than when it is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, and the code would only execute when `a` is not equal to 1, rather than when it is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed, and the code would only execute when `a` is greater than 0, rather than when it is not equal to 0.

DONE.
