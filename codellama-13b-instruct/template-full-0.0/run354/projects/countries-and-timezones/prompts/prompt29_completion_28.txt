  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the offset to be multiplied by 60, rather than divided by 60 as in the original code. This would result in a different offset value being used in the final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 30
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator would cause the offset to be divided by 30, rather than divided by 60 as in the original code. This would result in a different offset value being used in the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 30
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the offset to be added to 30, rather than divided by 60 as in the original code. This would result in a different offset value being used in the final result.

DONE.
