Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, which would not check for the presence of keys, potentially leading to an undefined return when the original code expected an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the condition to check for equality with zero would return `attributes` when it is empty, instead of returning `undefined`, thus altering the expected output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, which would not fulfill the original intent of checking the number of keys in the object, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
