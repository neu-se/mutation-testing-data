  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `fs.writeFileSync` method would throw a `TypeError` when passed `null` as the third argument, whereas it would not throw an error when passed `options` as the third argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object. The `fs.writeFileSync` method would not throw an error when passed `{}` as the third argument, whereas it would throw a `TypeError` when passed `options` as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value. The `fs.writeFileSync` method would throw a
