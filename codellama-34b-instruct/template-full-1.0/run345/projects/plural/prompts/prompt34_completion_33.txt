  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w. length - 2) + 'ees'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting position is different, causing the string manipulation to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(2, w. length - 2) + 'ees'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting position is different, causing the string manipulation to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(3, w.length - 2) + 'ees'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting position is different, causing the string manipulation to produce a different output.

DONE.
