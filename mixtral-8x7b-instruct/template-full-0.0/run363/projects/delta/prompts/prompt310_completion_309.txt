 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '\n' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the line-by-line iteration in the `eachLine` method would treat the newline character as an actual inserted line, causing incorrect line indexing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '', attributes: { bold: true } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would treat the empty string as a line with bold attributes, which might not be expected by the developers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: ' ', attributes: { italic: true } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would treat the single space character as a line with italic attributes, which might not be expected by the developers.

By introducing these changes, the test suite may not fail, but it would reveal potential weaknesses in the test coverage, as the developers might not have
