  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on `null` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which could potentially cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(undefined, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on `undefined` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which could potentially cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(promise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on `promise` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which could potentially cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.
