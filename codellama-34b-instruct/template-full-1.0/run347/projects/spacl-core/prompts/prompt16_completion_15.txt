  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character (except for line terminators) one or more times, followed by two or more consecutive forward slashes. This would be a different behavior than the original code fragment, which matches any character (except for line terminators) one or more times, followed by a single forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character (except for line terminators) one or more times, followed by a single forward slash. This would be a different behavior than the original code fragment, which matches any character (except for line terminators) one or more times, followed by a single forward slash and a character that is not a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character from the range
