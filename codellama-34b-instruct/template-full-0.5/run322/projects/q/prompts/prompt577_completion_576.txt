  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is a different operation than "next".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is a different operation than "next".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is not a valid operation.

DONE.
