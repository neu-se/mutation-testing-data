  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the negation of the test is true, whereas this new fragment just checks if the test is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && data }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the negation of the test, whereas this new fragment returns the boolean AND of the result of the test and the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) || data }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the negation of the test, whereas this new fragment returns the boolean OR of the result of the test and the data.

DONE.
