  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the presence of the 'latitude' property in the 'object' variable, but the replacement code is checking for the presence of the 'longitude' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the presence of the 'latitude' property in the 'object' variable, but the replacement code is checking for the presence of the 'longitude' property and returns its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['longitude']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the presence of the 'latitude' property in the 'object' variable, but the replacement code is checking for the presence of the 'longitude' property and returns its value using bracket notation.

DONE.
