  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  firefox.setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a Node.js function, and it's not available in the browser environment where Firefox is running. Using `setImmediate` in Firefox would result in a runtime exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  setTimeout(flush, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a browser function, and it's not available in the Node.js environment where Firefox is running. Using `setTimeout` in Firefox would result in a runtime exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  requestPortTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick` is a function that is specific to Firefox, and it's not available in the Node.js environment where Firefox is running. Using `requestPortTick` in Node.js would result in a runtime exception.

DONE.
