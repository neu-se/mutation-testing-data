  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` returns a promise that resolves with the result of the callback, whereas `universalify.fromCallback` returns a function that takes a callback as its argument and returns the result of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` returns a function that takes a callback as its argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a promise that resolves with the result of the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)` returns a function that takes a callback as its argument, whereas `universalify.fromProm
