Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the loop to continue if either `end` is truthy or `test(data)` returns true, which is the opposite of the original condition that requires both to be false for the loop to continue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the loop to continue if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is false, which changes the logic to allow for more iterations under different conditions than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the loop to continue if either `end` is falsy or `test(data)` is explicitly false, which alters the intended logic of the original condition.

DONE.
