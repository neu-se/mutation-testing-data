Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL string instead of the current URL string, potentially leading to incorrect parsing and resolution of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the current URL string, which would change the URL being parsed and likely lead to an invalid or unexpected URL structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the current URL string to uppercase, which could affect the parsing of the URL, especially in cases where the protocol or domain is case-sensitive.

DONE.
