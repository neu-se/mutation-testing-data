  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the string, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove an extra character from the string, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the string, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

DONE.
