  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the exception if the callback function throws an exception, while this new code fragment would always throw the exception, regardless of whether the callback function throws an exception or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the callback function throws an exception, while this new code fragment would always reject the promise, regardless of whether the callback function throws an exception or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the callback function does not throw an exception, while this new code fragment would always resolve the promise, regardless of whether the callback function throws an exception or not.

DONE.
