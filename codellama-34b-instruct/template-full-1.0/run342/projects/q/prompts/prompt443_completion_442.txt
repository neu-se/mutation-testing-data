  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if `reason` does not have a `stack` property, whereas the original code would not throw an error in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would provide a different message for the error, whereas the original code would provide the default message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the `reason` as the message, whereas the original code would not create a new error object.

DONE.
