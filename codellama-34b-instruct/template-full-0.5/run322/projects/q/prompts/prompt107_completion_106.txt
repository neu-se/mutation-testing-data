  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator would cause the loop to execute one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would cause the loop to never execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the loop to skip over the last element of the array, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
