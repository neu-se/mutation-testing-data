  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the forward slash (/) as a delimiter for the split() method, while the replaced code uses the backslash (\) as a delimiter. This would cause the split() method to return different results, which would in turn affect the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the forward slash (/) as a delimiter for the split() method, while the replaced code uses a space character as a delimiter. This would cause the split() method to return different results, which would in turn affect the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the forward slash (/) as a delimiter for the split() method, while the replaced code uses an empty string as a delimiter. This would cause the split() method to return different results, which would in turn affect
