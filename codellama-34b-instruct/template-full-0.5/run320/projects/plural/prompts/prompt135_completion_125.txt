  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the word to lowercase, which could cause the regular expression to not match and the rule to not be applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether the regular expression matches or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr()` method would return the substring starting from the second character of the word, which could cause the regular expression to not match and the rule to not be applied.

DONE.
