  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` is a function call that returns the length of the next op in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current op in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next op in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current op in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator to the next op and returns the op, while `otherIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current op in the iterator.

DONE.
