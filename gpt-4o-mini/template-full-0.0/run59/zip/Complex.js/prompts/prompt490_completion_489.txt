Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `__esModule` property from `true` to `false`, which may affect how the module is imported or used in other parts of the application that rely on this property to determine if the module is an ES module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the `__esModule` property to `undefined` could lead to unexpected results in module resolution, as it may not be recognized as a valid ES module, potentially breaking compatibility with other modules that expect this property to be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the value to `1` (a number) instead of `true` (a boolean) could lead to type-related issues in the code that checks for the `__esModule` property, as it may
