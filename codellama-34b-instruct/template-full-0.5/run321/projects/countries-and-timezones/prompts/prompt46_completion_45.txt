  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `options` is an object that is passed as an argument to the `getCountry` function. By replacing it with `options || {}`, we are essentially creating a new empty object if `options` is falsy, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `options` is an object that is passed as an argument to the `getCountry` function. By replacing it with `options && options.deprecated`, we are essentially checking if `options` is truthy and if it has a `deprecated` property, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `options` is an
