  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the `peekType` method to be called on the `otherIter` object, rather than the `peekType` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType.call(otherIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be used to call the `peekType` method on the `otherIter` object, rather than the `peekType` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType.bind(otherIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be used to bind the `peekType` method to the `otherIter` object, rather than the `peekType` property.

DONE.
