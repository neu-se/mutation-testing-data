  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the short-circuiting logical AND operator (`&&`), which evaluates to `false` if `currentUrl` is falsy, and the `url` property is never accessed. In contrast, the replaced code uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which always evaluates both operands and returns the first truthy value. If `currentUrl` is falsy, the `url` property will still be accessed, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrl && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the short-circuiting logical AND operator (`&&`), which evaluates to `false` if `currentUrl` is falsy, and the `url` property is never accessed. In contrast, the replaced code uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) to invert the value of `currentUrl`, and then uses the logical AND operator (`&&`)
