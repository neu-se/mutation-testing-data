  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || "promise was rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string, even if the promise was not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && "promise was rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected + "promise was rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always concatenate the string `"promise was rejected"` to the value of `rejected`, even if it is not a string.

DONE.
