  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit` would be called even if the task throws an exception, which would cause the domain to exit early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.run
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.run` would be called even if the task throws an exception, which would cause the domain to run the task again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.bind` would be called even if the task throws an exception, which would cause the domain to bind the task to the current context.

DONE.
