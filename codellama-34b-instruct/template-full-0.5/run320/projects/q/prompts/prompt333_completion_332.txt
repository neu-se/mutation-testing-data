  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `then` method. If the `result` variable is replaced with `undefined`, the code would throw an error when trying to call the `then` method on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `then` method. If the `result` variable is replaced with `null`, the code would throw an error when trying to call the `then` method on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and therefore does not have a `then` method. If the `result` variable is replaced with `{}`, the code would throw an error when trying to call the `then` method on it.
