  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different value than `op.retain`. The `insert` property contains the actual inserted value, while the `retain` property contains the length of the retained region. If the `retain` property is used instead, the transformed delta would contain the wrong length information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op['retain']
```
This would result in different behavior because `op['retain']` is a different value than `op.retain`. The `['retain']` property contains the same value as the `retain` property, but in a different form. If the `['retain']` property is used instead, the transformed delta would contain the wrong length information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `!op.insert` is a negation of the `insert` property, which would
