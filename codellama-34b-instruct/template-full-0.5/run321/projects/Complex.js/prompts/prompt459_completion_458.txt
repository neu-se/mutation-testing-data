  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this['im']` is less than 0, while the new code checks if it is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] < 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this['im']` is less than or equal to 0, while the new code checks if it is strictly less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] > 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this['im']` is less than or equal to 0, while the new code checks if it is strictly greater than 0.

DONE.
