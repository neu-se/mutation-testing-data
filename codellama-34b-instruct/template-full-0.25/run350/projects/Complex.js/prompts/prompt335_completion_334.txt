  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `b` and `a`, which is different from the original code that calculates the arctangent of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `a` and `b` and then add `Math.PI` to the result, which would shift the result by 90 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `a` and `b` and then subtract `Math.PI` from the result, which would shift the result by -90 degrees.

DONE.
