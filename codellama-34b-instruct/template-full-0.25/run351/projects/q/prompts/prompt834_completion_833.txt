  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with three arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with two arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with only one argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
