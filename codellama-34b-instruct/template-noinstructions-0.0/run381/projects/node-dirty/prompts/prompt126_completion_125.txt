  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'write_close'` event when the write stream is closed, while the mutated code emits a `'write_error'` event, which may not be handled by the application and could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'write_close'` event when the write stream is closed, while the mutated code emits a `'write_end'` event, which may not be handled by the application and could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'write_close'` event when the write stream is closed, while the mutated code emits a `'write_drain'` event, which may not be handled by the application and could result in
