  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a fulfilled promise, which would not execute the `rejected` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would catch the error and execute the `rejected` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would execute the `rejected` callback with the rejected promise.

DONE.
