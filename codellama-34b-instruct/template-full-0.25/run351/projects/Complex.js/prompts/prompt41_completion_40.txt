  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the logarithm to the base 10, while `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` returns the logarithm to the base 2, while `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm of the product of `a` and `b`, while the original code calculates the logarithm of the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
