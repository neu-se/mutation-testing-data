  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, which can be different from the original value. For example, if `bearing` is -5, `Math.abs(bearing)` would return 5, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the bearing by 2 would double the angle, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect. For example, if `bearing` is 45, `bearing * 2` would return 90, which would cause the calculation to be wrong.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting 180 from the bearing would flip the direction of the bearing, which would cause
