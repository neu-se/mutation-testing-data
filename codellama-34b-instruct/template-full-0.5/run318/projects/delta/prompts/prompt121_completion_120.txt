  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object is used to determine the length of the operation, and adding 1 to it would result in an incorrect length calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object is used to determine the length of the operation, and subtracting 1 from it would result in an incorrect length calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object is used to determine the length of the operation, and multiplying it by 2 would result in an incorrect length calculation.

DONE.
