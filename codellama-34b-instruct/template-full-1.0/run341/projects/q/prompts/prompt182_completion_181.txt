  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the function name from the stack trace, which could affect the accuracy of the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(":", "-")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace ":" with "-" in the stack trace, which could affect the ability to parse the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine[0] + stackLine[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the first two characters of the stack trace and ignore the rest, which could cause the error message to be incomplete or difficult to read.

DONE.
