  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `== null` is a less strict comparison than `!== "undefined"`. In the case where `window` is not defined, `typeof window === "undefined"` would evaluate to `true`, but `window == null` would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!== "undefined" && !Array.isArray(window)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray(window)` is a more specific check than `typeof window !== "undefined"`. In the case where `window` is not an array, the check `!Array.isArray(window)` would return `true`, but the check `typeof window !== "undefined"` would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window === this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the local context, which may not be the same as the global `window` object.
