  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end + 1` would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value, potentially causing the `onEnd` callback to be called with a different argument than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end - 1` would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value, potentially causing the `onEnd` callback to be called with a different argument than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause the `once` function to be called with a different value, potentially causing the `onEnd` callback to be called with a different argument than expected.

DONE.
