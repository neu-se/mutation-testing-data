  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is of type `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `resolvedPromise` is a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
