Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = Q(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the resolved promise to `resolvedPromise` without calling `become`, which means that the promise will not handle the queued messages or progress listeners correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise immediately with the provided value instead of resolving it, which changes the intended outcome of the function from a successful resolution to a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `fulfill(value)` instead of `value`, which may lead to a different resolution process if `fulfill` modifies the value in some way before resolving the promise.

DONE.
