  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to return `false` if `ctx` is not `undefined`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx === null
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to return `false` if `ctx` is `null`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to return `false` if `ctx` is an empty string, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
