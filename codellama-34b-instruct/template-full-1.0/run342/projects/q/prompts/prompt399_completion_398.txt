  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a promise resolved with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>.inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the inspection of the promise, which could be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>().inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `inspect` on the promise returned by `PLACEHOLDER`, which could be rejected.

DONE.
