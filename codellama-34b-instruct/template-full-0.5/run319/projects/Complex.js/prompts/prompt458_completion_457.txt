  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isInfinite()` method, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the complex number is not at the infinity pole.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` method checks if the complex number is not a number, whereas the `isInfinite()` method checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite()` method checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole, whereas the `isInfinite()` method checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole.

DONE.
