  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the `pendingCount` is less than 0. This would cause the `deferred.reject` function to be called immediately if the `pendingCount` is less than 0, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the `pendingCount` is greater than 0. This would cause the `deferred.reject` function to be called immediately if the `pendingCount` is greater than 0, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
