  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, which could cause issues in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be incremented by 1, which could cause issues in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be multiplied by 2, which could cause issues in the calculations.

DONE.
