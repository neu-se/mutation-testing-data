  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` would be passed as an argument to `cb`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as an argument to `cb`, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` would be passed as an argument to `cb`, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
