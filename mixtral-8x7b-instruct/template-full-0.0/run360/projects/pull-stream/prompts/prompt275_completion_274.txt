 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned stream would always be an empty stream, which might not be the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned stream would be a random number instead of a stream object, which would definitely not be the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the current execution context, which might not be a stream object, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
