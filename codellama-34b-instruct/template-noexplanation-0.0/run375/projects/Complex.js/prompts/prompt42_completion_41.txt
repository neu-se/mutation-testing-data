  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the multiplication order changed. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it could potentially cause issues if the multiplication order is important for some reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the multiplication order changed and the signs of the terms reversed. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it could potentially cause issues if the multiplication order is important for some reason.

DONE.
