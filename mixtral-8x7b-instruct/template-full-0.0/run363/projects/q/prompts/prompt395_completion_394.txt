 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would now catch any exceptions thrown during the resolution process, preventing them from being handled by subsequent promises or error handlers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would change the value of `this` within the `then` method, potentially causing unintended behavior or errors in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function passed to `then` would prevent the resolved value from being passed to the next promise or handler in the chain, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors downstream.

DONE.
