  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of using them as arguments for the `Complex` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the values of `a` and `b` instead of using them as arguments for the `Complex` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of `a` and `b` instead of using them as arguments for the `Complex` constructor.

DONE.
