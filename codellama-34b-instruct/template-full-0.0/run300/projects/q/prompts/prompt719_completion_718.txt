  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is used to retrieve the keys of an object, while the `values` method is used to retrieve the values of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is used to retrieve the keys of an object, while the `length` property is used to retrieve the number of elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is used to retrieve the keys of an object, while the `toString` method is used to convert an object to a string.

DONE.
