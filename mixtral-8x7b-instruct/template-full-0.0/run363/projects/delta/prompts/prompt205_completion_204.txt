 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a truthy `delete` property as a delete operation, rather than specifically checking if it's a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof thisOp.retain !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `thisOp` with a truthy `retain` property as a retain operation, rather than specifically checking if it's a number or an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `thisOp` with a truthy `retain` property as a retain operation, including strings and booleans, rather than specifically checking if it's a number or an object.

DONE.
