  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while the modified code fragment checks if it is equal to one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while the modified code fragment checks if it is greater than zero.

DONE.
