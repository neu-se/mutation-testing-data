  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes operations onto the `ops` array if they are not equal to the previous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes operations onto the `ops` array if they are not equal to the previous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes operations onto the `ops` array if they are not equal to the previous operation.

DONE.
