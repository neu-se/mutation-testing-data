  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute
```
This would result in different behavior because `!path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is not absolute, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute(options.dest)` checks if the `dest` path is absolute, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the `url` path is absolute.

DONE.
