  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is not absolute, while this new code fragment checks if the destination path is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is not absolute, while this new code fragment checks if the destination path is not absolute and the URL path is absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) || path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the destination path is not absolute, while this new code fragment checks if the destination path is absolute or the URL path is absolute.

DONE.
