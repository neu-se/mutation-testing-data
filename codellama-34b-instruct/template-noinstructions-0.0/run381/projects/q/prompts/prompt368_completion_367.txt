  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the value passed to it, while `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the value passed to it as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns the value passed to it, while `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the value passed to it as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the value passed to it as the reason, while `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the value passed to it.

DONE.
