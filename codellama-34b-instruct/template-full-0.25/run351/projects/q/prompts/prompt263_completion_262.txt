  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with the given value, whereas `undefined` is a value that is not equal to `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with the given value, whereas `null` is a value that is not equal to `value`.

DONE.
