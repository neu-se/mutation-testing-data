  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a different function than `array_slice.call`, and it would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice` is a different method than `array_slice`, and it would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is a different object than `arguments`, and `slice` is a different method than `array_slice`, and it would produce a different output.

DONE.
