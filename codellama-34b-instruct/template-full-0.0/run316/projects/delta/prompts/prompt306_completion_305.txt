  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the line length to be incremented by 1, which would affect the behavior of the `indexOf` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the line length to be decremented by 1, which would affect the behavior of the `indexOf` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the line length to be doubled, which would affect the behavior of the `indexOf` method.

DONE.
