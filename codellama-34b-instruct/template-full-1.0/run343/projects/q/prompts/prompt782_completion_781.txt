  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `regardless` as a formal parameter for the `onFulfilled` function, which is no longer the case in this modified code, and the `onRejected` function is being called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected, onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `onRejected` as a formal parameter for the `onRejected` function, which is no longer the case in this modified code, and the `onFulfilled` function is being called instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onRejected, onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `promise` as a formal parameter for the `when` function, which is no longer the case in this modified code
