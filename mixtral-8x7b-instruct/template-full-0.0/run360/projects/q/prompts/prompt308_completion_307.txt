 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(resolve, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an asynchronous delay before resolving the promise, which could cause issues if the test suite expects the promise to be resolved synchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `resolve` method of the `deferred` object, bypassing the `then` method and potentially causing the test suite to miss any errors that might occur during the resolution process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a `null` value, which could cause issues if the test suite expects a specific value to be returned.

DONE.
