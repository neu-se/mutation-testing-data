Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? 'error' : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for `false` instead of `true`, and returns a string `'error'` when `abort` is `false`, which is not the intended behavior of returning `null` or the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? undefined : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `undefined` instead of `null`, which can lead to different handling in JavaScript, especially in cases where the distinction between `null` and `undefined` matters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? abort : 'abort'
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the value of `abort` when it is `true`, but returns the string `'abort'` otherwise, which changes the expected output type from potentially a boolean or null to a string.

DONE.
