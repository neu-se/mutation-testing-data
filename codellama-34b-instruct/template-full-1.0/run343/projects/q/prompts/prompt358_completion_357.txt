  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is created and returned, instead of the original progressed function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.prototype.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is called on the Q prototype, instead of the original progressed function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {return false;}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is created that always returns false, instead of the original progressed function being called.

DONE.
