  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['sub'](z['isInfinity'](), z['isInfinite'](), this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sub` method is called with the wrong number of arguments, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['add'](z['isInfinity'](), z['isInfinite'](), this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `add` method is called with the wrong number of arguments, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['mul'](z['isInfinity'](), z['isInfinite'](), this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mul` method is called with the wrong number of arguments, causing an error.

DONE.
