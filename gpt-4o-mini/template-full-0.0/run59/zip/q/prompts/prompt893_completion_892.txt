Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.nfapply` function to attempt to call `null` as a function, resulting in a runtime error instead of executing the intended callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also lead to a runtime error when trying to call `undefined` as a function, similar to the first option, but it may also lead to different error handling depending on how the calling code is structured.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not_a_function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call a string as a function, leading to a TypeError, which indicates that the value is not callable, thus breaking the expected promise chain.

DONE.
