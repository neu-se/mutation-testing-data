  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that if `read.source` is not a function, the code would enter the `if` block and throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks for the type of the operand, and if `read.source` is an object, the code would enter the `if` block and throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && read.source.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object returns the constructor function that created the object, and if `read.source` is a function, the code would enter the `if` block and throw an error.

DONE.
