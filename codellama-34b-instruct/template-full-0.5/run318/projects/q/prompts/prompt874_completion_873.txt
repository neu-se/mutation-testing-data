  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its first argument, but `null` is not a function. The `defer` function would throw an error when called with `null`, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its first argument, but the function `function () {}` does not have any side effects. The `defer` function would call the function and return a promise that resolves immediately, which would cause the test to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function () { throw new Error("Test error") })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its first argument, but the function `function () { throw new Error("Test error") }` throws an error
