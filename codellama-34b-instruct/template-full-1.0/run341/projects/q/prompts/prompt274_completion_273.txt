  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string, while `error` is an object. The `makeNodeResolver` function expects an object with a `message` property, so replacing `error` with `error.message` would cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.stack` is a string, while `error` is an object. The `makeNodeResolver` function expects an object with a `stack` property, so replacing `error` with `error.stack` would cause it to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `error` is an object. The `makeNodeResolver` function expects an object with a `stack` property, so replacing `error` with `null` would cause it to fail.
