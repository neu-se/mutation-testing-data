  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduceRight
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduceRight` method is used instead of `reduce`, which would reverse the order of the elements in the `parts` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.map
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is used instead of `reduce`, which would return a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the `parts` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is used instead of `reduce`, which would return a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

DONE.
