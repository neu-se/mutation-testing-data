  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a > 0 && b === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the inverse condition, where `a` is less than or equal to 0, which would allow for the computation of complex roots.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a === 0 && b > 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the inverse condition, where `b` is less than or equal to 0, which would allow for the computation of complex roots.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a === 0 && b === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the inverse condition, where `a` and `b` are not equal to 0, which would allow for the computation of complex roots.

DONE.
