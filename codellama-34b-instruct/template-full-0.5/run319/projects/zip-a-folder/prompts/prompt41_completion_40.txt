  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon is a statement terminator, and using it in this context would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the dot operator is used for accessing object properties, and using it in this context would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the slash operator is used for division, and using it in this context would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
