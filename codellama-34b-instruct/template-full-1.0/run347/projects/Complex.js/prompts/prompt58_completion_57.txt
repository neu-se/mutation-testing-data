  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(a['r']) && !isFinite(a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator has been added in front of isFinite(a['r']), which would result in the test returning the opposite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['r']) || Number.isFinite(a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the Boolean operators have been changed from && to ||, which would result in the test returning true if either condition is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['r']) && Number.isFinite(a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator has been removed, which would result in the test always returning false.

DONE.
