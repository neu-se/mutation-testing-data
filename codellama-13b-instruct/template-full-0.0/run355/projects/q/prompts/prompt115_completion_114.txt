  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would return an array of `undefined` values, rather than the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would return an array of `null` values, rather than the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would return an array of `NaN` values, rather than the original values.

DONE.
