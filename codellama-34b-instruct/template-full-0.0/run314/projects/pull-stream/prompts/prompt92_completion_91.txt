  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `find` function, while `data + 1` would be a new value that is one greater than the original `data` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `find` function, while `data.length` would be the length of the `data` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `find` function, while `data[0]` would be the first element of the `data` array.

DONE.
