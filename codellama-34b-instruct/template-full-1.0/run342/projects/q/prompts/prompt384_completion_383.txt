  Sure, here are three options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.then(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `callback` promise, which may not be the same as the `value` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.reduce(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is called on the `callback` promise, which may not be the same as the `value` promise, and may produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called on the `callback` promise, which may not be the same as the `value` promise, and may produce a different result.

DONE.
