  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to access the length of the next operation in the other delta, rather than the current operation in the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to access the length of the next operation in the current delta, rather than the current operation in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to access the minimum of the lengths of the next operations in the current and other deltas, rather than the length of the next operation in the other delta.

DONE.
