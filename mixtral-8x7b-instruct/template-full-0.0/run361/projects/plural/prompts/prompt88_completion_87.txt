 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'person' for the input 'person', while this change would return 'persons'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 'peoples'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a specific rule for the input 'person', while this change would ignore that rule and always return 'peoples' for any input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.charAt(w.length - 1) === 'e' ? w + 's' : w + 'es'; }
