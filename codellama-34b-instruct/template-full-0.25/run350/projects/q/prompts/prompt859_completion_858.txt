  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the argument to the `deferred.reject` method, which would cause an error to be thrown when the method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be passed as the argument to the `deferred.reject` method, which would cause an error to be thrown when the method is called.

DONE.
