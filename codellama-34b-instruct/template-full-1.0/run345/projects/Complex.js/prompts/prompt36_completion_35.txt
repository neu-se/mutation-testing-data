  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that calculates the arctangent of a number, while `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a function that checks whether a number is NaN (Not a Number), while `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), while `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm of a number.

DONE.
