  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== undefined).map(policy => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any policies with an undefined `name` property, which could cause the `map` method to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy]).filter(pair => pair[0] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any pairs where the first element is undefined, which could cause the `map` method to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy]).filter(pair => pair[1] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any pairs where the second element is undefined, which could cause the `map`
