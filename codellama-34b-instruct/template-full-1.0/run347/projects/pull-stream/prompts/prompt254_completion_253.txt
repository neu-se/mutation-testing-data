  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
location.href = 'http://attackersite.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was simply passing a parameter to the `values` function, whereas this new code fragment is overwriting the `location.href` property with a malicious URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { alert('XSS!'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was simply passing a parameter to the `values` function, whereas this new code fragment is creating a new function that will pop up an alert box with the message "XSS!".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3.14 - Math.Random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was simply passing a parameter to the `values` function, whereas this new code fragment is subtracting a random number from 3.14, which would result in a different value being passed to the `values` function.
