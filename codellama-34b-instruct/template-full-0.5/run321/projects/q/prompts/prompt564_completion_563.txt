  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw exception` would throw an exception, whereas `reject` would reject a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return Q(exception)` would return a promise that is rejected with the given exception, whereas `reject` would reject a promise.

DONE.
