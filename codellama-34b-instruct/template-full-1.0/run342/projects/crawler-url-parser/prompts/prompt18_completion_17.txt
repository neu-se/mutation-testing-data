  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is missing, while this new fragment always adds the 'http://' protocol, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!localhost)\w+:/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only removes the protocol if it is not 'localhost', while this new fragment removes the protocol in all cases, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\.\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only removes a leading '.' if it is present, while this new fragment removes a leading '.' and trailing '/', which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently.

DONE.
