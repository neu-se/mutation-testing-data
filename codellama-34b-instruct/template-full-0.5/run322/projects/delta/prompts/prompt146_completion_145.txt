  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(index - start);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping or repeating operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator for the other delta, potentially causing the two iterators to become out of sync.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null value into the ops array, potentially causing errors when the delta is later used.

DONE.
