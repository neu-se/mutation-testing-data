Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always attempts to retrieve zero operations, which would effectively return an empty operation regardless of the actual state of `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect diffs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times instead of moving forward in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, which would lead to operations from the other delta being processed instead of the current one, resulting in incorrect diff results.

DONE.
