Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'

var reduce = require('./reduce')

module.exports = function collect (cb) {
  return reduce(function (arr, item) {
    <PLACEHOLDER>(item)
    return arr
  }, [], cb)
}

```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
