  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute value of a number, which is not the same as the `isInfinity()` function used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero()` function is used to check if a complex number is equal to zero, whereas the `isInfinity()` function used in the original code is used to check if a complex number is equal to infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is used to access the real part of a complex number, whereas the `im` property used in the original code is used to access the imaginary part of a complex number.

DONE.
