  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is not a valid method in the SES library, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is not a valid method in the SES library, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.ok()` is a valid method in the SES library, and would not cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
