  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `arguments` object has only one element, while this code checks if it has more than one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `arguments` object has only one element, while this code checks if it has no elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `arguments` object has only one element, while this code checks if it has a different number of elements.

DONE.
