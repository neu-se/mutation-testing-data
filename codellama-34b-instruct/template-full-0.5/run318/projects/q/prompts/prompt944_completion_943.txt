  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is not a valid function and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would resolve the promise immediately, instead of waiting for the `setTimeout` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would reject the promise immediately, instead of waiting for the `setTimeout` function to be called.

DONE.
