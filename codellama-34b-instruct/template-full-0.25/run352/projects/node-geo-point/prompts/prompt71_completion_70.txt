  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in the range of 0 to 360 degrees, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing in the range of 180 to 540 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in the range of 0 to 360 degrees, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing in the range of 0 to 720 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in the range of 0 to 360 degrees, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing in the range of -180 to 180 degrees.

DONE.
