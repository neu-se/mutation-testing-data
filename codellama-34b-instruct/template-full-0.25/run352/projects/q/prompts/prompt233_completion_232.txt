  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the context of the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, and it would change the context of the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `promiseDispatch` method to `null`, which could cause errors if the method relies on the context.

DONE.
