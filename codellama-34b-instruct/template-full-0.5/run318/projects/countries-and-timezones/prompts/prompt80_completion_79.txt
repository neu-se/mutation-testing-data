  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezone` would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, which would cause the function `getCountriesForTimezone` to return an empty array instead of an array of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timezones"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezone` would return the `timezones` object instead of a valid timezone object, which would cause the function `getCountriesForTimezone` to return an array of timezone objects instead of an array of country objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"countries"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezone` would return the `countries` object instead of a valid timezone object, which would cause the function `getCountriesForTimezone` to return an array of country objects instead of an array of timezone objects.
