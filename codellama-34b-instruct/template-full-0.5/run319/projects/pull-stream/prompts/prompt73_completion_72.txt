  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` and `done` arguments, which would cause the function to behave differently than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(done || function () {}, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `done` and `abort` arguments in a different order, which could cause the function to behave differently than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` and `done` arguments, but with different values for the `abort` argument. This could cause the function to behave differently than the original code fragment.

DONE.
