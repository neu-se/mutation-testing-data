  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `get` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be doubled, which would cause the `get` method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be squared, which would cause the `get` method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
