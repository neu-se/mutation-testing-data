  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns the sine of its argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos(φ2)` function returns the cosine of the latitude of the second point, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan(θ)` function returns the tangent of the bearing of the two points, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument.

DONE.
