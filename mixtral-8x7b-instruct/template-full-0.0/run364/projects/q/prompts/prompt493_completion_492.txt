 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be fulfilled with the reason as `false`, instead of being rejected with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would always be thrown, changing the rejected promise into a rejected promise with an error object, which might not be handled correctly in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current promise object, changing the rejected promise into a fulfilled promise with the current promise object as its value. This might not be the expected behavior in some test cases.

DONE.
