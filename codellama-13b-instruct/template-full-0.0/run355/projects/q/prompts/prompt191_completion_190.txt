  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the entire stack trace line, including the column number, whereas the original code fragment only matches the file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the entire stack trace line, including the column number, whereas the original code fragment only matches the file name and line number.

DONE.
