  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["fnally"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is misspelled, so it would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.then()` method is not called, so any exception that may occur in the callback function will not be handled by the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.done()` method is not called, so any exception that may occur in the callback function will not be handled by the promise chain.

DONE.
