  Mutation prompt: 

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because without the `sink` variable, the callback function would not be able to perform the drain operation, which would cause the program to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
&sink
```
This would result in different behavior because `&sink` is a reference to the `sink` variable, but it would be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.n()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.n()` is a method that does not exist in the `sink` object, which would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
