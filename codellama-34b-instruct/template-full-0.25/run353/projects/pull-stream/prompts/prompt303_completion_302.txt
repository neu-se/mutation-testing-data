  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, causing the `read` function to be called with `true` instead of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `read` function to be called with `false` instead of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `read` function to be called with `true` instead of `ended`.

DONE.
