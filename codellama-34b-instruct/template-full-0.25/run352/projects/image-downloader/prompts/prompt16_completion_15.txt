  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new path by joining `options.dest` with `decodedBasename`, which is not the same as the original code that joined `options.dest` with a placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, basename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new path by joining `options.dest` with `basename`, which is not the same as the original code that joined `options.dest` with a placeholder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, path.basename(options.url));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new path by joining `options.dest` with the basename of `options.url`, which is not the same as the
