  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[2]` would be used instead of `ref[1]`, which could cause the function to operate on the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[2] + 1` would be used instead of `ref[1]`, which could cause the function to operate on the wrong data and potentially lead to an off-by-one error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1] + 1` would be used instead of `ref[1]`, which could cause the function to operate on the wrong data and potentially lead to an off-by-one error.

DONE.
