 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the targetBasePath to the current working directory, instead of calculating the directory name of the targetFilePath.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the base name of the targetFilePath instead of its directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(targetFilePath) => path.dirname(targetFilePath).split(path.sep).slice(0, -1).join(path.sep)
