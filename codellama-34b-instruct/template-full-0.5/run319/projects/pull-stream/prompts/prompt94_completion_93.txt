  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. If the `test` function returns `undefined`, the callback will not be called, even if the test passes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, while `null` is a falsy value. If the `test` function returns `true`, the callback will be called, even if the test fails.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'hello'` is a truthy value, while `null` is a falsy value. If the `test` function returns `'hello'`, the callback will be called, even if the test fails.

DONE.
