  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, not if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, not if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, not if it is zero.

DONE.
