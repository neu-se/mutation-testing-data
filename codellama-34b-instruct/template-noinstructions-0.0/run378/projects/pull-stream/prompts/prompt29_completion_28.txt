  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ref[1]` accesses the second element of the `ref` array, while the new code fragment `ref[2]` accesses the third element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ref[1]` accesses the second element of the `ref` array, while the new code fragment `ref[0]` accesses the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ref[1]` accesses the second element of the `ref` array, while the new code fragment `ref[length - 1]` accesses the last element of the `ref` array.

DONE.
