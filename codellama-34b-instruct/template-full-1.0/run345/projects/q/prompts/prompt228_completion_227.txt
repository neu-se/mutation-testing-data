  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This could potentially cause the program to produce different output or behave differently, as the ordering of elements in the `messages` array may be important for the correct functioning of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This could potentially cause the program to produce different output or behave differently, as the removal of elements from the `messages` array may be important for the correct functioning of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes and returns a specified number of elements from the beginning of an array, whereas `
