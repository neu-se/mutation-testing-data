 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `retain` is a function, while the original code checks if it's an object and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('retain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'retain' is an own property of the nextOp object, without considering its type or nullability.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'retain' is not equal to undefined, which is less restrictive than checking for an object and not null.

DONE.
