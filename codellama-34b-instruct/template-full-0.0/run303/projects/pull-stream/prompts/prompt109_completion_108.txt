  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `reducer` function expects two arguments, but the `acc` and `data` variables are being passed as a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is being called with the arguments in the reverse order. The `reducer` function expects the accumulator to be the first argument, but it is being passed as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `reducer` function. The `reducer` function only expects two arguments, but three arguments are being passed.

DONE.
