  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` addition would cause the function to return a different result than the original code, which could produce unexpected results if the result is used in subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` subtraction would cause the function to return a different result than the original code, which could produce unexpected results if the result is used in subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` multiplication would cause the function to return a different result than the original code, which could produce unexpected results if the result is used in subsequent calculations.

DONE.
