 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would receive an empty array as the second argument instead of the actual `args` array. This could cause issues if the fallback function relies on the contents of `args` to determine the appropriate behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would receive `null` as the second argument instead of the actual `args` array. This could cause issues if the fallback function is not designed to handle `null` values and expects an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{then: function() {}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would receive an object with a `then` method instead of the actual `args` array. This could cause issues if the fallback function is not designed to handle promises and expects an array.

DONE.
