  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the attributes of the next operation, whereas `push` is a method that adds an operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the attributes of the next operation, whereas `push` is a method that adds an operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new operation into the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an operation to the delta.

DONE.
