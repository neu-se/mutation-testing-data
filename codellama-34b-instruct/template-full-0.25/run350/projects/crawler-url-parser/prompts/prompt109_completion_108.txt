  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property is being added to the map twice, which could cause the map to have duplicate keys and potentially incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is being used as the value in the map, which could cause the map to have different keys and potentially incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property is being used as the value in the map, which could cause the map to have different keys and potentially incorrect values.

DONE.
