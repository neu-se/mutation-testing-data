  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== Object(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object, while this code fragment checks if `value` is not a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor !== Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object, while this code fragment checks if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value.then === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object, while this code fragment checks if `value` has a `then` method.

DONE.
