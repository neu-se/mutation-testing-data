 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` without any arguments in case of a successful read, while this modification always passes the read data to the callback, which might cause issues if the test suite expects the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with a single argument (`err`) in case of a successful read, while this modification passes the read data as the first argument and an undefined error as the second argument, which might cause issues if the test suite expects the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the read data as-is to the callback, while this modification passes the uppercase version of the read data, which might cause issues if the test suite expects
