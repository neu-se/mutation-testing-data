  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta, while this replacement only checks for the type of the next operation in the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of the next operation in the current delta, while this replacement only checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta to be 'insert', while this replacement checks for the type of the next operation in the other delta to be anything other than 'insert'.

DONE.
