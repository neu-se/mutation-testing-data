Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes the last character instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "nucleus" (which should become "nuclei").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'es' to the word instead of applying the correct pluralization rule, resulting in incorrect outputs like "nucleuses" instead of "nuclei".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 'ies
