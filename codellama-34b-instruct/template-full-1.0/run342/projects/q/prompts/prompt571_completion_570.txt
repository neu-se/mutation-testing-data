  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this, arguments)();
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with `this` and `arguments` bound to the current context, whereas `apply` calls a function with `this` and an array of arguments. In this case, the `arguments` object is not an array, so calling `apply` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this, ...arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with `this` and an arbitrary number of arguments, whereas `apply` calls a function with `this` and an array of arguments. In this case, spreading the arguments would result in all arguments being passed to the function, whereas `call` would only pass the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a
