  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 's' and 'es' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 'es' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 's', 'es', and 'ies' to the end of the word.

DONE.
