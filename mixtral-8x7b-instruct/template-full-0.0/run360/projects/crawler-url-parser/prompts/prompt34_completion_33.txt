 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new URL` creates a `URL` object, while the original `URL.parse` returns an object with parsed URL properties. This change would introduce an error since the `new URL` constructor expects a base URL as its first argument, which is not provided in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('url').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires an explicit import of the `url` module's `parse` function. The original code uses the `URL.parse` shorthand, which is a Node.js-specific feature. By changing it to the explicit import, the code would not work in a browser environment, introducing different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `global` object to access the `
