  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
  if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
  if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
  for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` method is called with a callback function that is not the same as the original code. The original code had a callback function that was not used, while the new code uses the callback function to emit an error event if there is an error writing to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
  if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
  if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.
