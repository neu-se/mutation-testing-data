Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat non-object types (like arrays or null) as valid, potentially leading to unexpected results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `b` is null, allowing other non-object types (like strings or numbers) to pass through, which could lead to incorrect comparisons in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow arrays to pass through as valid, rejecting all other object types, which would disrupt the intended functionality of the `diff` method.

DONE.
