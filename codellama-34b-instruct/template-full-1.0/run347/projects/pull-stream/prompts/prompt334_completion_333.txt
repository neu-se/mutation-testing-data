  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` will invert the value of `end`, causing the `cb` function to be called with `end` set to `false` instead of `true`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end = true` will always set `end` to `true`, regardless of its original value, which could cause the `cb` function to be called unnecessarily or with incorrect parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = false
```
This would result in different behavior because `end = false` will always set `end` to `false`, regardless of its original value, which could cause the `cb` function to be called unnecessarily or with incorrect parameters.

DONE.
