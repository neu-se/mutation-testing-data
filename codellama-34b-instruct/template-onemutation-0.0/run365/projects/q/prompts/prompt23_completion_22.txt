  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit` is a function that exits the current domain, whereas `domain.enter` is a function that enters the current domain. Using `domain.exit` instead of `domain.enter` would cause the code to exit the domain before running the task, which could have unintended consequences.
