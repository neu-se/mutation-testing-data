  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which would affect the iteration over the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which would affect the iteration over the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which would affect the iteration over the `ops` array.

DONE.
