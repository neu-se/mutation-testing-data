 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `substr` have slightly different behaviors when handling negative indexes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the returned string is incorrect, and the suffix is changed to "us" instead of "i".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/.$/, 'ices') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it only replaces the last character instead of removing the last two characters and appending "i".

DONE.
