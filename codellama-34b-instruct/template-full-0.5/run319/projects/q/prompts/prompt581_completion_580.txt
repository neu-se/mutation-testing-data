  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `"throw"` is a keyword that throws an exception. In the context of the code, `reject` would cause the promise chain to be rejected, while `"throw"` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `"throw"` is a keyword that throws an exception. In the context of the code, `resolve` would cause the promise chain to be resolved, while `"throw"` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foobar"
```
This would result in different behavior because `foobar` is not a valid keyword or function, whereas `"throw"` is a keyword that throws an exception. In the context of the code, `foobar` would cause a
