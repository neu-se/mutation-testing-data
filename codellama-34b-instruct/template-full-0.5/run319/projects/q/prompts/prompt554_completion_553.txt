  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `when` would be resolved with `null`, rather than the value of `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `when` would be resolved with `undefined`, rather than the value of `result.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `when` would be resolved with `false`, rather than the value of `result.value`.

DONE.
