  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would receive the `value` property of the `exception` object, which may not be the same as the `exception` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would receive the `message` property of the `exception` object, which may not be the same as the `exception` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would receive the `name` property of the `exception` object, which may not be the same as the `exception` object itself.

DONE.
