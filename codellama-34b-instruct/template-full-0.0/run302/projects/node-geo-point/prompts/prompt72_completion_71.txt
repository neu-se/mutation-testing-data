  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the distance to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds the distance down to the nearest integer. This could cause the calculated destination point to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the distance to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds the distance up to the nearest integer. This could cause the calculated destination point to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the distance to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds the distance to the nearest integer using `Math.round`. This could cause the calculated destination point
