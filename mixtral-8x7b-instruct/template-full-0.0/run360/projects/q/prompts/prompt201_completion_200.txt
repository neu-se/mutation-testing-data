 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"\nFrom previous event:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator string used to concatenate stack traces is changed, which might cause issues in debugging or logging stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator string used to concatenate stack traces is repeated, which might cause confusion in debugging or logging stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"\nAnother event:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator string used to concatenate stack traces is changed, which might cause issues in debugging or logging stack traces.

DONE.
