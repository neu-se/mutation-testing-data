  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a `null` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value, rather than the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value, rather than the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a function argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a function value, rather than the expected value.

DONE.
