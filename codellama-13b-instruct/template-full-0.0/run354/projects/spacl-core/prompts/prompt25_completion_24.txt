  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opt` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `min` variable is not initialized to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && max < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opt` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `max` variable is not initialized to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opt` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `any` variable is not initialized to false.

DONE.
