Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'criteria', which is a plural noun, while the replacement code fragment is 'criterion', which is a singular noun.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'criteria', which is a plural noun, while the replacement code fragment is 'criterion', which is a singular noun.
