  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
initialValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator would be incremented by 1, which could affect the result of the reduction operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
initialValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator would be multiplied by 2, which could affect the result of the reduction operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
initialValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator would be decremented by 1, which could affect the result of the reduction operation.

DONE.
