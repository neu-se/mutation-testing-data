  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/y$|ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'x' character is missing from the alternation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/ii
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'i' flag is added which makes the regular expression case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'g' flag is added which performs a global match.

DONE.
