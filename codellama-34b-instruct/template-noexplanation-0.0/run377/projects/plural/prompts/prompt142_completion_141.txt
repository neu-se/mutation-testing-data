  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This code fragment is a simpler version of the original code fragment, which checks if the first element of the `rule` array is equal to the `word` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This code fragment is a more concise version of the original code fragment, which checks if the first element of the `rule` array is a regular expression that matches the `word` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])
```
This code fragment is a more concise version of the original code fragment, which checks if the `word` variable matches the regular expression stored in the first element of the `rule` array.

DONE.
