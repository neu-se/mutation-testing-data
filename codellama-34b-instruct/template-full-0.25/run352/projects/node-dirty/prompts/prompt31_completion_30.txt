  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to `undefined`, regardless of whether `val` is `undefined` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the callback to `undefined`, regardless of whether `cb` is provided or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val, () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the callback to an empty function, regardless of whether `cb` is provided or not.

DONE.
