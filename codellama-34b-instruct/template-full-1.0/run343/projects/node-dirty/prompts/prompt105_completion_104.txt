  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the `key` variable by 1, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of the `key` variable by 1, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key*2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the `key` variable, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
