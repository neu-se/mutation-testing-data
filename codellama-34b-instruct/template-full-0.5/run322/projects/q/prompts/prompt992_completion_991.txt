  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object to access the second argument passed to the function, while this replacement code fragment is adding 1 to the `arguments` object, which would result in a different value being passed to the `Q` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object to access the second argument passed to the function, while this replacement code fragment is multiplying the `arguments` object by 2, which would result in a different value being passed to the `Q` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object to access the second argument passed to the function, while this replacement
