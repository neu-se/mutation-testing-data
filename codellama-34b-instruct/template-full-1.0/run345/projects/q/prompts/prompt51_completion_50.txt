  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is being called with an argument, but the original code does not specify any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is being called with no arguments, and then the result of that call (which should be a function) is being called with `flush` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is being called with two arguments, but the original code only specifies one argument. The second argument is an empty object, which is likely to cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
