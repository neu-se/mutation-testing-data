  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is fulfilled, the `done` method will not be called, and the rejection will not be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is fulfilled, the `done` method will not be called, and the progress will not be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notified
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is fulfilled, the `done` method will not be called, and the notification will not be handled.

DONE.
