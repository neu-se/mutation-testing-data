 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the power calculation would be incorrect for the case when the base is a purely imaginary number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the power calculation would be incorrect for the case when the exponent is a purely real number and the base is not a positive real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the power calculation would be incorrect for the case when the exponent is a purely real number and the base is a negative real number.

DONE.
