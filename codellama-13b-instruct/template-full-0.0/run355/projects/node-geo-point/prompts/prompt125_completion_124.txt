  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method is called with the `this` context, which is the `GeoPoint` object, and the `point` parameter, which is a `GeoPoint` object. This would cause the method to calculate the distance between the two `GeoPoint` objects, rather than the distance between the `GeoPoint` object and the `point` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(point, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method is called with the `point` parameter, which is a `GeoPoint` object, and the `this` context, which is the `GeoPoint` object. This would cause the method to calculate the distance between the two `GeoPoint` objects, rather than the distance between the `GeoPoint` object and the `point` parameter.
