  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sinks
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the keys in the `sinks` object instead of the `sources` object. This may cause the loop to skip over some keys or iterate over keys that are not intended to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the keys in the `throughs` object instead of the `sources` object. This may cause the loop to skip over some keys or iterate over keys that are not intended to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sources.keys()
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the keys in the `sources` object, but using the `keys()` method to get an array of keys instead of using the `for...in` loop. This may cause the loop to iterate over the keys in a different order or skip over some keys.
