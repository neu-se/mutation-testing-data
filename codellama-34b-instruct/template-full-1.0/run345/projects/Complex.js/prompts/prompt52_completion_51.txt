  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a['arg'] * 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function would be receiving a much larger input value, which would result in a significantly different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a['arg'] * -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function would be receiving a negative input value, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a['arg'] + 3.14)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function would be receiving a slightly different input value, which would result in a slightly different output.

DONE.
