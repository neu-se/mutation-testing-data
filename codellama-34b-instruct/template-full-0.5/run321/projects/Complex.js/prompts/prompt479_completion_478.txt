  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the imaginary part of the complex number plus 1 instead of just the imaginary part, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the imaginary part of the complex number multiplied by 2 instead of just the imaginary part, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
