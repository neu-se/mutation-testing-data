  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the values of the object instead of the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs instead of an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the keys in reverse order instead of the original order.

DONE.
