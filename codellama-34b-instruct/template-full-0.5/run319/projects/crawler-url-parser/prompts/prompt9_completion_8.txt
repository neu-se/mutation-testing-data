  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not anchored to the start of the string, so it would replace any occurrence of "//" in the base URL, not just the one at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/\/\//g, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is global, so it would replace all occurrences of "//" in the base URL, not just the one at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is anchored to the start of the string, so it would only replace the first occurrence of "//" in the base URL, not all occurrences.

DONE.
