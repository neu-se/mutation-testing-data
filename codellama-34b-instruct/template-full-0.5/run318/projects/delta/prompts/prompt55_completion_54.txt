  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(ops) => !Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this replacement checks if it is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(ops) => Array.isArray(ops) && ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this replacement checks if it is an array with a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(ops) => Array.isArray(ops) && ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this replacement checks if it is an array with a length greater than 0.

DONE.
