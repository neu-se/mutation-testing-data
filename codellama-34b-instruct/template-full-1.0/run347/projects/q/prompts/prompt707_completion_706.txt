  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first argument passed to the `fbound` function, which is referenced later in the return statement as `arg1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only slice off the first argument passed to the `fbound` function, leaving the rest of the arguments unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first two arguments passed to the `fbound` function, which were referenced later in the return statement as `arg1` and `arg2`.

DONE.
