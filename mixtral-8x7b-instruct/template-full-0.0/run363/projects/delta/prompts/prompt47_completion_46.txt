 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the keys of the first operand `a` instead of the second operand `b`. This could lead to incorrect embed type detection if the keys of the operands don't match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'nonexistent_embed_type'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a nonexistent embed type, which would cause the `getHandler` method to throw an error. This could expose issues with error handling in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `null` instead of an array. This could expose issues with null checks and error handling in the test suite.

DONE.
