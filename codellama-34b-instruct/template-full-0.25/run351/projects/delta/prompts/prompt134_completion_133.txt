  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp` method returns the next operation in the sequence, but adding 1 to it would cause the method to return the operation after the next one, which could be a different operation altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastOp` method returns the last operation in the sequence, which could be a different operation than the one returned by `nextOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` array contains all the operations in the sequence, and `index + 1` would refer to the operation after the current one, which could be a different operation altogether.

DONE.
