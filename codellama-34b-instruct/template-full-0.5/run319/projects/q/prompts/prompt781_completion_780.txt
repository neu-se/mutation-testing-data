  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function is not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function` keyword would create a new function expression, which would be different from the `regardless` function that is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be returned, which would be different from the `regardless` function that is expected.

DONE.
