  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array returned by `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`, while this new code fragment is using the `[0]` index to access the first element of the array, which would cause the loop to only execute once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array returned by `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`, while this new code fragment is using the `[1]` index to access the second element of the array, which would cause the loop to only execute twice.
