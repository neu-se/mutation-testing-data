Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && (priority || otherIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for a 'delete' operation instead of 'insert', which would lead to retaining operations when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' || (priority && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR instead of AND, which could allow for retaining operations even when the conditions for insertion are not met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && (priority && otherIter.peekType() === 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to require both conditions to be true, which could lead to skipping necessary retain operations when the priority is true and the other operation is a delete.

DONE.
