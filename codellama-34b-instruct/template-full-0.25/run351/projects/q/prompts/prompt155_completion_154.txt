  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `filterStackString` function to uppercase, which would likely cause an error when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `filterStackString` function, starting from the second character. This would likely cause an error when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `filterStackString` function. This would likely cause an error when the function is called.

DONE.
