  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the entire delta, whereas `delta.retain` would retain the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(length, {})` would retain the delta with an empty attribute map, whereas `delta.retain` would retain the delta with its original attribute map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { foo: 'bar' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(length, { foo: 'bar' })` would retain the delta with an attribute map containing the key-value pair `foo: 'bar'`, whereas `delta.retain` would retain the delta with its original attribute map.

DONE.
