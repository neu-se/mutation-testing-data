  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` argument, which would return a different timezone object than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `timezones` object directly, bypassing the `getTimezone` function and returning a different timezone object than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with the `data` and `name` arguments, which would return a different timezone object than the original code fragment.

DONE.
