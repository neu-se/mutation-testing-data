  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have an error-handling mechanism, so this change would cause the program to throw an error and stop running.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a value, while this change would cause the function to return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a value that is a non-zero number, while this change would cause the function to return 0.

DONE.
