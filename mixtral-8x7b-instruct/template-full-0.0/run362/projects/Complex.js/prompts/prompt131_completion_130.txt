 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error if `this['isInfinite']()` returns true, while the original code would correctly return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, while the original code checks if the result of subtraction is NaN or Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the real part of the complex number for infinity, while the original code checks both the real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
