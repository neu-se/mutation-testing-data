Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` from the original function's context to the global context, potentially leading to unexpected results when accessing properties or methods that rely on the original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, self
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to the callback function, which may lead to incorrect values being used in the function execution, thus altering the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the first argument to `null`, which may cause the callback function to behave incorrectly if it expects a valid context or object reference, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
