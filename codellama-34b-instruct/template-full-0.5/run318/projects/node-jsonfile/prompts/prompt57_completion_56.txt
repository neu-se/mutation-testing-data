  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` character is an escape character in regular expressions, and it would cause the regular expression to match a literal backslash followed by the letter `n`, rather than a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\r\n` sequence matches a carriage return followed by a newline, which is a common line ending sequence in Windows-style text files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/gm
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression causes the regular expression to match across multiple lines, which would cause the regular expression to match the entire input string, rather than just the first line.

DONE.
