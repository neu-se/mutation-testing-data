  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf16le' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the default encoding is 'utf8', and using a different encoding would cause the readFileSync method to behave differently.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
{ flag: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the default flag is 'r', and using a different flag would cause the writeFileSync method to behave differently.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
{ mode: '0666' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the default mode is '0644', and using a different mode would cause the writeFileSync method to behave differently.

DONE.
