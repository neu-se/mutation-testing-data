  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword, which refers to the current object. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to fail because `null` does not have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword, which refers to the current object. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to fail because `undefined` does not have a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword, which refers to the current object. Replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the code to fail because an empty object does not have a `then` method.

DONE.
