  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any non-empty string that does not contain a forward slash, while the buggy code fragment would match any non-empty string that does not contain a forward slash or a period.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any non-empty string that does not contain a forward slash, while the buggy code fragment would match any non-empty string that does not contain a forward slash or a period, and ends with a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any non-empty string that does not contain a forward slash, while the buggy code fragment would match any non-empty string that does not contain a forward slash or a period, and ignores case
