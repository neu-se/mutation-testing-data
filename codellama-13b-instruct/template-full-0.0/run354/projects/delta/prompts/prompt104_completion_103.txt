  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes two arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes no arguments. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError when it is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes two arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes two arguments. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError when it is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index, other)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes two arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes three arguments. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError when it is executed.

DONE.
