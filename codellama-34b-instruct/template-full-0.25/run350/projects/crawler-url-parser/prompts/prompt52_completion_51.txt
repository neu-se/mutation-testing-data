  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the path of the parsed URL instead of the URL itself, which could lead to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the host of the parsed URL instead of the URL itself, which could lead to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol of the parsed URL instead of the URL itself, which could lead to different results in the `parse` function.

DONE.
