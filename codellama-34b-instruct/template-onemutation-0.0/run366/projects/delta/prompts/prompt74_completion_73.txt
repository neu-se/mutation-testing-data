  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the `retain` property of `newOp` to `length`, while the modified code fragment sets the `retain` property of `newOp` to `length` and then overwrites it with `length` again. This would cause the `retain` property to always be equal to `length`, regardless of the value of `length`.
