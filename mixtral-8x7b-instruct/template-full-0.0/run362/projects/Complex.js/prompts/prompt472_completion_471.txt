 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] !== this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a constant false value, changing the method's behavior to always return true for the 'isNaN' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the method call with a constant value, which is always true if the input is not a number, but will always be false if the input is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] > 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a comparison that is not present in the original code, which may cause the method to return unexpected results based on the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
