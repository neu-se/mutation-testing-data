  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a) - Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `tan` method with a single argument, whereas this replacement code fragment uses the `tan` method with two arguments, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) - Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `sin` method with a single argument, whereas this replacement code fragment uses the `sin` method with two arguments, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) - Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `cos` method with a single argument, whereas this replacement code fragment uses the `cos` method with two arguments, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
