  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `abort` to `end`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `null` to `end`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

DONE.
