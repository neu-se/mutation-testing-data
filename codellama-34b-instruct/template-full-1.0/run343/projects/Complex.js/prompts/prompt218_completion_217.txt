  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, which would change the resulting angle in the complex plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b*b+a*a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, which would change the resulting magnitude of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(Math.sqrt(b*b+a*a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function returns the natural logarithm of a number, which would change the resulting angle in the complex plane.

DONE.
