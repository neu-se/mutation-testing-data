  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code changes the order of operations. Instead of first adding the name to the args array, it now adds the args array to the name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args.concat([name])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code changes the data structure being passed. Instead of passing an array of two elements, it now passes an array of one element, where the first element is an array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args].reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code changes the order of the arguments. This could cause the code to react differently to different inputs.

DONE.
