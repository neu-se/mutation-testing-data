  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns a new array of the values of the object, while `Object.keys` returns a new array of the keys of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns a new array of the names of the own properties of the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns a new array of the keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns a new array of the entries of the object, which are arrays containing a key and a value, while `Object.keys` returns a new array of the keys of the object.

DONE.
