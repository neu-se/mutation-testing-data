Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var qStartingLine = captureLine(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value passed to `captureLine` from an expected line number to a constant integer, which may not correspond to the actual line number where the error occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var qStartingLine = captureLine("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument type from a number to a string, which may cause `captureLine` to behave incorrectly if it expects a numeric input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var qStartingLine = captureLine(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` may lead to unexpected results or errors in the `captureLine` function, as it may not handle `undefined` as a valid input.

DONE.
