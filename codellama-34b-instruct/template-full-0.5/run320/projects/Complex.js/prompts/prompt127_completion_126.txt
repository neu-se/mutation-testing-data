  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current object is infinite and the argument is also infinite, whereas the original code only checks if the current object is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current object is infinite and the argument is zero, whereas the original code only checks if the current object is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['isNaN']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current object is infinite and the argument is NaN, whereas the original code only checks if the current object is infinite.

DONE.
