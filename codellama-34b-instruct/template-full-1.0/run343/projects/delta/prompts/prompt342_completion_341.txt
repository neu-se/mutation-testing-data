  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [embedType, opData, baseOpData] = getEmbedTypeAndData(
          thisOp,
          baseOp.insert,
        );
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would be called with `thisOp` as the first argument, which would cause the function to return a different set of values, potentially leading to different behavior in the subsequent code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [embedType, opData, baseOpData] = getEmbedTypeAndData(
          null,
          baseOp.insert,
        );
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the function to return a different set of values, potentially leading to different behavior in the subsequent code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [embedType, opData, baseOpData
