  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `unhandledRejections` array to an empty state, whereas the original code would only reset the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to an empty state, whereas the original code would only reset the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
