  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict inequality operator (`<`) to check if `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while the modified code fragment uses the non-strict inequality operator (`<=`) to check if `b` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`. This change in behavior could potentially cause the `toString` method to return a different string representation of the complex number, depending on the value of `b`.

DONE.
