  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, rather than just truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is not strictly equal to `false`, even if it is truthy.

DONE.
