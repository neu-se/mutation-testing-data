  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because while `test` would evaluate to `true` if it is not null or undefined, `!test` would evaluate to `false` if `test` is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because while `test` would evaluate to `true` if it is not null or undefined, `test.length` would throw an error if `test` is not an array or a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because while `test` would evaluate to `true` if it is not null or undefined, `test.call()` would throw an error if `test` is not a function.

DONE.
