  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but it does not return a promise. In the original code, `callback` is a promise, so `callback.fcall(value)` would not return a promise, which would cause the `then` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but it does not return a promise. In the original code, `callback` is a promise, so `callback.fcall(value).then(function () { return value; })` would not return a promise, which would cause the `then` method to fail.
