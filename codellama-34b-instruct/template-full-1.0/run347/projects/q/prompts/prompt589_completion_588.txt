  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.reject is the opposite of Q.async, it will reject the promise immediately instead of executing the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.resolve is the opposite of Q.async, it will resolve the promise immediately instead of executing the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>())
```
This would result in different behavior because it will resolve the promise with the result of the function returned by the PLACEHOLDER, instead of executing the function.

DONE.
