Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `config.hasOwnProperty` is a function that takes a property name as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the property exists directly on the object, whereas `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` is a more robust way to check for property existence that avoids issues with objects that have overridden the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends!== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `config.extends!== undefined` checks if the `extends` property exists and is not undefined, but does not distinguish between properties that exist but have a value of `null` or other falsy values, whereas `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` checks if the property exists directly on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.in instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `config.in instanceof Object` checks if the `in` property exists and is an instance of `Object`, which is unrelated to the original check for the `extends` property, and would likely cause the function to behave
