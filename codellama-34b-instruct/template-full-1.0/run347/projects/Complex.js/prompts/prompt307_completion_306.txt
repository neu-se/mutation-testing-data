  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be different in the case of b=0;

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be different in the case of a=0;

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be different in the case of b=0 or a=0.

DONE.
