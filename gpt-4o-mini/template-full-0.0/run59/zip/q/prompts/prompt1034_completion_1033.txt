Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the line capture by adding 1, which could lead to incorrect stack trace information, potentially obscuring the actual line of code where an error occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the line capture by 2, which would misrepresent the actual line number in stack traces, making debugging more difficult.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 5 from the line capture, which could lead to pointing to a completely different line in the stack trace, thus confusing the source of errors.

DONE.
