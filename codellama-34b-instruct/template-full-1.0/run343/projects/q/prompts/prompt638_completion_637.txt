  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid key for the `delete` operation, and it would throw an error instead of deleting the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete a different property than the original code, since it increments the key by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key = null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` as the value of the property instead of deleting it.

DONE.
