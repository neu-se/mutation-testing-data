 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the function call with a constant integer value, which would always return 10, regardless of the length of the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 10
