  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present, while this code fragment would replace it with "https://" regardless of whether it is already present or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the fragment (the part of the URL after the "#") if it is present, while this code fragment would replace it regardless of whether it is present or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present and the URL does not start with "//
