  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is now being passed to the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is now being passed to the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now being passed to the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that argument.

DONE.
