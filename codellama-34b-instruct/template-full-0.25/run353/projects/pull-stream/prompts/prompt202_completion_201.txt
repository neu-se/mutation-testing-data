  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with an `abort` argument, which would then be passed to the `map` function. However, if we replace `abort` with `null`, the `read` function would not be called with an `abort` argument, and the `map` function would not be called with the expected `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with an `abort` argument, which would then be passed to the `map` function. However, if we replace `abort` with `undefined`, the `read` function would not be called with an `abort` argument, and the `map` function would not be called with the expected `abort` argument.
