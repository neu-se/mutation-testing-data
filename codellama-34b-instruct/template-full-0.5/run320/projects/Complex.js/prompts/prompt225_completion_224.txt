  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This would cause the `return` statement to be executed when `b` is not 0, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is greater than 0. This would cause the `return` statement to be executed when `b` is greater than 0, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is less than 0. This would cause the
