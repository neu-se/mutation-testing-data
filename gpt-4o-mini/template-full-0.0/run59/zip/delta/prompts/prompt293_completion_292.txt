Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(iter.next(index));
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the operations instead of pushing them to the `line`, which would lead to loss of data instead of accumulating it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.peek());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the current operation without consuming it from the iterator, potentially causing an infinite loop or incorrect state as the same operation would be processed repeatedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(iter.next(index));
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to retain the operations instead of pushing them, which could lead to unexpected results in how the `line` is constructed and processed.

DONE.
