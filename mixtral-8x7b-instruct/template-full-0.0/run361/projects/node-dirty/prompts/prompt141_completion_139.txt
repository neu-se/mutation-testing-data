 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event would not be emitted when an error occurs, but instead a 'warn' event would be emitted. This could cause issues to go unnoticed and make it harder to debug the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would not be handled and would instead be swallowed by the empty function. This could cause issues to go unnoticed and make it harder to debug the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
