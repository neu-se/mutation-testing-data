  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "foo" to the `src` variable, which would change the path that is being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `src` variable to uppercase, which could change the path that is being accessed if the path contains any lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the `src` variable, which could change the path that is being accessed if the path contains any characters that are not in the same order as the original path.

DONE.
