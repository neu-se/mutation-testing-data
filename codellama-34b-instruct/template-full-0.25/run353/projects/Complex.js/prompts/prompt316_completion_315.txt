  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `a`, while the new code fragment calculates the negative sine of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `a`, while the new code fragment calculates the cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `a`, while the new code fragment calculates the tangent of `a`.

DONE.
