Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly attempt to transform the data instead of inverting it, leading to a loss of the original data structure and potentially corrupting the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invertAttributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a non-existent method (assuming `invertAttributes` does not exist), which would throw an error instead of performing the intended inversion of attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke a method that is likely intended to remove data rather than invert it, resulting in the loss of information rather than a proper inversion of the operation.

DONE.
