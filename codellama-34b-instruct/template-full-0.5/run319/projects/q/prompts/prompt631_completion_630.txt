  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "set" method is used to set the value of a property, whereas the "delete" method is used to delete a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method is used to post a message to a value in a future turn, whereas the "delete" method is used to delete a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "apply" method is used to apply a function to a value in a future turn, whereas the "delete" method is used to delete a property.

DONE.
