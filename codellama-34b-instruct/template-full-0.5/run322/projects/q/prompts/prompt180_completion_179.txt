  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they contain the string `"(node.js:"`, which would lead to incorrect filtering of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for all stack lines, even if they do not contain the string `"(node.js:"`, which would lead to incorrect filtering of the stack trace.
