  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` returns `true` if the number is not finite, while `isFinite` returns `true` if the number is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite(this['im'])` checks if the imaginary part of the number is finite, while `isFinite(this['re'])` checks if the real part of the number is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] === Infinity` checks if the imaginary part of the number is equal to infinity, while `this['re'] === Infinity` checks if the real part of the number is equal to infinity.

DONE.
