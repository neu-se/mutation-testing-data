  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not an insertion, while this replacement checks if the next operation is an insertion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not a deletion, while this replacement checks if the next operation is not an insertion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not a retention, while this replacement checks if the next operation is a retention.

DONE.
