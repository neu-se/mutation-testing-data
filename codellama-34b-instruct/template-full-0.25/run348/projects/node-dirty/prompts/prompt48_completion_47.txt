  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) + 1), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `updater` function to receive a different value than the original code, which could potentially result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) - 1), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `updater` function to receive a different value than the original code, which could potentially result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) * 2), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `updater` function to receive a different value than the original code, which could potentially result in a different outcome.

DONE.
