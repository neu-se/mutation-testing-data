  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the asynchronous `_writeFile` function, while the replaced code uses the synchronous `writeFileSync` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `universalify.fromCallback` function to wrap the asynchronous `fs.writeFile` function, while the replaced code calls the `fs.writeFileSync` function directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `universalify.fromCallback` function to wrap the asynchronous `fs.writeFile` function, while the replaced code uses the synchronous `writeFileSync` function.

DONE.
