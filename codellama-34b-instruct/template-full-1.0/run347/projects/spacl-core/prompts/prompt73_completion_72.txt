  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const path = 'invalid';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the path to be evaluated as invalid, even if it is actually valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'invalid';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the action to be evaluated as invalid, even if it is actually valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const ctx = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the context to be null, even if it is actually not null.
