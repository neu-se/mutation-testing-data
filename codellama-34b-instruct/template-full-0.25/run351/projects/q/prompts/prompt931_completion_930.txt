  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfbind` is a different function than `Q.denodeify`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a different function than `Q.denodeify`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify.bind` is a different function than `Q.denodeify`.

DONE.
