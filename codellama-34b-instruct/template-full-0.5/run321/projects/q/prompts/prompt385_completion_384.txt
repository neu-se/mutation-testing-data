  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value`, which is a resolved promise, while the new code fragment returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value`, which is a resolved promise, while the new code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value`, which is a resolved promise, while the new code fragment returns a rejected promise with a custom error message.

DONE.
