 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for division by zero instead of considering both numbers as infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for division by zero instead of considering both numbers as infinite or zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for NaN values instead of considering both numbers as infinite. Note that comparing a value with NaN using `==` or `===` will always return false, so this might not be the best choice for a mutation, but it still changes the behavior of the code.

DONE.
