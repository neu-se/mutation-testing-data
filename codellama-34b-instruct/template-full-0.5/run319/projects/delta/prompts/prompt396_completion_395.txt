  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete || otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `retain` operation to be treated as a `delete` operation, which could cause the `transform` method to behave incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete && otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the `retain` operation to be treated as a `delete` operation if the `delete` operation is also present, which could cause the `transform` method to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `retain` operation to be treated as a `delete` operation, which could cause the `transform` method to behave incorrectly.

DONE.
