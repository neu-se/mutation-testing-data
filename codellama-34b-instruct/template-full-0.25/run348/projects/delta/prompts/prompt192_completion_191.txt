  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the other iterator has a next element, while this code fragment checks if the next element is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the delta's ops array is empty, while this code fragment checks if the length of the ops array is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is equal to 0, while this code fragment checks if the index is even.

DONE.
