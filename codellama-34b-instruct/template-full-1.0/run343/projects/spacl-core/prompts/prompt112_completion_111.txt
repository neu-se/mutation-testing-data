  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of (verbs || {})
```
This would result in different behavior because if `verbs` is undefined or null, the empty object `{}` will be used instead, which means that the loop will never execute and no verbs will be allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object instead of the values, which means that the verbs would not be allowed in the same way as before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object instead of the keys, which means that the verbs would not be allowed in the same way as before.

DONE.
