  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is the opposite of `isEqual`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when the two values are equal, and `true` when they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isLessThan
```
This would result in different behavior because `isLessThan` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the first value is less than the second value, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGreaterThan
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGreaterThan` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the first value is greater than the second value, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
