  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the order of the strings used in the `diff()` function, causing the function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` function to compare the wrong strings, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` function to compare the strings in the wrong order, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
