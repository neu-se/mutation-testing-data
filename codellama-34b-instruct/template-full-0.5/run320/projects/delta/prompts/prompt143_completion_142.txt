  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the next operation, while `peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator than `thisIter`, and `peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current operation, and `otherIter` is a different iterator than `thisIter`, so the length of the current operation in `otherIter` would be different from the length of the current operation in `thisIter`.

DONE.
