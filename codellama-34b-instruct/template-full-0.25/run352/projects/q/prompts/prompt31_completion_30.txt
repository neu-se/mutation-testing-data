  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be used as the argument to `pop()`, which would cause the function to return the last element of the array instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be used as the argument to `pop()`, which would cause the function to return the last element of the array instead of the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be used as the argument to `pop()`, which would cause the function to return the last element of the array instead of the first one.

DONE.
