  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, but the modified code checks if `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, but the modified code checks if `b` is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b % 2 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, but the modified code checks if `b` is equal to 1 modulo 2.

DONE.
