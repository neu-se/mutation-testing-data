  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment calls the function with the arguments `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a bound function with the context set to `value`, whereas the original code fragment calls the function with the context set to `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with `null` as the context, whereas the original code fragment calls the function with `void 0` as the context.

DONE.
