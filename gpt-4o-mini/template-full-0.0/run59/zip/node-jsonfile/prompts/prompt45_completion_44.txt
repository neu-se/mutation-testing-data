Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to stringify `null` instead of the actual object, leading to the output being the string "null" instead of a JSON representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, { encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the options passed to `stringify`, potentially affecting how the object is serialized, especially if the `stringify` function relies on specific options for formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, { reviver: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `reviver` option to `null`, which could alter the way the JSON is parsed when read back, potentially leading to unexpected results if the original object relies on a reviver function for proper deserialization.

DONE.
