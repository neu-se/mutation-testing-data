  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) && isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only accept lines that are both internal frames and node frames, which would be a more restrictive condition than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) || !isNodeFrame(line) || line
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would accept lines that are not internal frames or not node frames, which would be a less restrictive condition than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would accept all lines, regardless of whether they are internal frames or node frames.

DONE.
