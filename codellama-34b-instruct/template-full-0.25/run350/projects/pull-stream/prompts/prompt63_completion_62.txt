  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end = end || abort` is a short-circuiting OR operation, which means that if `end` is truthy, the `abort` condition will not be evaluated. In contrast, the new code fragment `end = abort || end` is a non-short-circuiting OR operation, which means that both `abort` and `end` will be evaluated, even if `end` is truthy. This could potentially cause the `abort` condition to be triggered even if `end` is not falsy, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end = end || abort` is a short-circuiting OR operation, which means that if `end` is truthy, the `abort` condition will not be evaluated. In contrast, the new code fragment `end = !end && abort
