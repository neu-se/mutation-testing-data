 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to false, bypassing the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to 0, which would be evaluated as falsy in the conditional statement, bypassing the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to null, which would be evaluated as falsy in the conditional statement, bypassing the tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
