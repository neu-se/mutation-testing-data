  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
empty = []
```
This would result in different behavior because `empty` is an empty array, while `cb` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined = 42
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that represents an undefined or missing value, while `42` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null = "null"
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value in JavaScript that represents an undefined or missing value, while `"null"` is a string.

DONE.
