  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` would always return `false`, which would change the behavior of the code that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike !== isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` would always return `false` when it is compared to itself, which would change the behavior of the code that follows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike === isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` would always return `true` when it is compared to itself, which would change the behavior of the code that follows.

DONE.
