 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'random_string'
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant string is used instead of the policy name, causing incorrect policy lookups.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number is used instead of the policy name, causing unpredictable policy lookups.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>policy).name
```
This would result in different behavior because using `<any>` bypasses TypeScript's type checking, potentially allowing for incorrect policy lookups if the `policy` object does not have a `name` property.

DONE.
