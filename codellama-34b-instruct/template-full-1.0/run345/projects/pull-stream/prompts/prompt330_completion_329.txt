  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `data`, and passing `undefined` to `op` would likely cause an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `data`, and passing `null` to `op` would likely cause an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a different value than `data`, and passing `"hello"` to `op` would likely cause an error or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
