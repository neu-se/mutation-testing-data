  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is not defined in the scope of `array_map`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.basis
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` is a local variable inside the `array_reduce` function and `this` is not defined in the scope of `array_map`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder is an anonymous function, while the original code fragment calls a callback function.

DONE.
