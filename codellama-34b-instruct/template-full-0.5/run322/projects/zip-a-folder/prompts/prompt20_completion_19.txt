  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten if it already exists, whereas the original code used the default `flags` option of `'a'`, which appends to the file if it already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'a', start: 10 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` option is set to `10`, which means that the file will be written starting from the 10th byte, whereas the original code used the default `start` option of `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'w', encoding: 'utf16le' })
```
This would result in different behavior because
