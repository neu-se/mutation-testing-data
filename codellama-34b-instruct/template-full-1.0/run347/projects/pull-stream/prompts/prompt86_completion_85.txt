  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function (error) { throw error }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `abort` variable as its first argument, while the new code fragment would throw an error if the `cb` function is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `abort` variable as its first argument, while the new code fragment would call the `cb` function only if it is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () { return undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `abort` variable as its first argument, while the new code fragment would return `undefined` if the `cb` function is not provided.
