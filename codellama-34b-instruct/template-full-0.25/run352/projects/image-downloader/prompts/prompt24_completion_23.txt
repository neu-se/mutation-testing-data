  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is a different property than `options.dest`, and it may not be a valid destination path for the image.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the parent directory of the given path, which may not be the desired destination for the image.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` returns the file name without the directory path, which may not be the desired destination for the image.

DONE.
