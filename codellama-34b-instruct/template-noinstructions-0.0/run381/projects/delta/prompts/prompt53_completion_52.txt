  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the handler, even if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!handler
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of the handler, even if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if the handler is not defined, which could cause errors in the code that uses the handler.

DONE.
