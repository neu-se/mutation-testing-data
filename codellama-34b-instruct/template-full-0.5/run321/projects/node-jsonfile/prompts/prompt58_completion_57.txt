  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\r\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the OS-specific end-of-line character, while this replacement uses the Windows-specific end-of-line sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the OS-specific end-of-line character, while this replacement uses the Mac-specific end-of-line sequence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the OS-specific end-of-line character, while this replacement uses the Unix-specific end-of-line sequence.

DONE.
