 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\..+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that starts with "/index." followed by any character(s), instead of matching only lowercase alphabets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "i" flag makes the regex case-insensitive, which would allow it to match uppercase alphabets as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]+\//, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that starts with "/index.", followed by any lowercase alphabet, and ends with a "/". This would not replace the "/index." strings that are at the end of the URL.

DONE.
