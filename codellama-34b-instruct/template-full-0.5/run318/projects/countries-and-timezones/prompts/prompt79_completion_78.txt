  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not defined in the `getTimezone` function and would return `undefined`, which would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return `null` instead of an array of countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` property is not defined in the `getTimezone` function and would return `undefined`, which would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return `null` instead of an array of countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).countries
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countries` property is not defined in the `getTimezone` function and would return `undefined`, which would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to
