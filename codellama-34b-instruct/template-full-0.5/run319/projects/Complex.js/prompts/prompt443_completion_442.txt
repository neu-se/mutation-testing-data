  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
20
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would return a different result, since 20 is not equal to 10.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would return a different result, since 5 is not equal to 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would return a different result, since pi is not equal to 10.

DONE.
