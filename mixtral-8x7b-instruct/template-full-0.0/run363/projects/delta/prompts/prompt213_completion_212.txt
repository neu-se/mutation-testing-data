 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly modifies the `delta.ops` array, bypassing the `Delta` constructor. The original code creates a new `Delta` object with the modified `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.ops.push(...other.ops.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the spread operator to push `other.ops.slice(1)` into `delta.ops`, which is not the same as concatenating arrays. The original code creates a new `Delta` object with the modified `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the entire `other.ops` array
