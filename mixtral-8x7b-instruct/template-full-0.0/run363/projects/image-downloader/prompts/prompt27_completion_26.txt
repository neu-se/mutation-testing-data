 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is passed to `request` instead of the `options` object. The `request` function may not behave as expected when it doesn't receive the necessary options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object, and the `toUpperCase()` method is not applicable to objects. This would throw a TypeError, causing the function to behave differently than the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because only the `url` option is passed to the `request` function, while the original implementation passes the entire `options` object. This may cause the `request` function to behave differently, as it might expect more options than just the URL.

DONE.
