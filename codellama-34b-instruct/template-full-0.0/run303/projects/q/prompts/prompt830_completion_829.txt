  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` callback to be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas the original code only called it for fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rejected` callback to be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas the original code only called it for rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` callback to be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas the original code only called it for fulfilled promises. Additionally, the callback function is empty, so it would not have any effect on the behavior of the code.

DONE.
