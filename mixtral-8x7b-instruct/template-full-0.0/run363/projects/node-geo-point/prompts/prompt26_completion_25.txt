 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `deg2rad` would be incorrect, causing unexpected results in the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `point1Rad` value with 0, causing the distance calculation to be incorrect in the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the `calculateDistance` method, causing unpredictable results.

DONE.
