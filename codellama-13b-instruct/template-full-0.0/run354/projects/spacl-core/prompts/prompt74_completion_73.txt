  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `null` instead of `false` when the action is not explicitly allowed or denied by any of the rules. This would indicate that the action is not governed by the policy, rather than explicitly denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `true` instead of `false` when the action is explicitly allowed by any of the rules. This would indicate that the action is explicitly allowed, rather than explicitly denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `undefined` instead of `false` when the action is not explicitly allowed or denied by any of the rules. This would indicate that the action is not governed by the policy, rather than explicitly denied.

DONE.
