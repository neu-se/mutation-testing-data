  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `base` element does not have an `href` attribute, the original code would return `null`, while the new code would return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') || 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `base` element does not have an `href` attribute, the original code would return `null`, while the new code would return a default value of `https://`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') || $('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `base` element does not have an `href` attribute, the original code would return `null`, while the new code would return the value of the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

DONE.
