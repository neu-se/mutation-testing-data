  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
  process.nextTick(flush);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick()` is synchronous, whereas `setTimeout()` is asynchronous.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
  setTimeout(flush, 1000);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout()` schedules the `flush` function to be executed 1 second after it is called, whereas `process.nextTick()` executes the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
  requestPortTick();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick()` uses a message channel to execute the `flush` function, whereas `setTimeout()` simply schedules it to be executed at a later time.

DONE.
