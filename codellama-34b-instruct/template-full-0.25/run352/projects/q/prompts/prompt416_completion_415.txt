  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise inspect object, which has a `state` property that can be either "fulfilled", "rejected", or "pending". By checking if the state is "pending", we are checking if the promise is still in the pending state, and not yet fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is in the fulfilled state, and not yet rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is in the rejected state, and not yet fulfilled.

DONE.
