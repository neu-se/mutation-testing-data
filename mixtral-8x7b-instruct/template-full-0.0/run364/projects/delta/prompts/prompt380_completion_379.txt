 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method of the `delta` object would receive a `null` value instead of an operation from the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the same operation multiple times if there are consecutive identical operations in the `other` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ type: 'insert', insert: 'placeholder' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new operation with a fixed 'insert' value ('placeholder') instead of the next operation from the `other` Delta.

DONE.
