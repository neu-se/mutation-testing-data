  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not the same as `a * a + b * b`. The original code fragment is computing the square of `a` and `b` and adding them together, while the replaced code fragment is just adding `a` and `b` together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is not the same as `a * a + b * b`. The original code fragment is computing the square of `a` and `b` and adding them together, while the replaced code fragment is just multiplying `a` and `b` together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b * 2` is not the same as `a * a + b * b`. The original code fragment is computing the square of `a`
