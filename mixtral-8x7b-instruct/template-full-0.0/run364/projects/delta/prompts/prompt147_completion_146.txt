 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next.bind(thisIter)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately invokes the `next` method, instead of passing it as a function reference. This could lead to unexpected iteration or errors if the `next` method relies on context provided by the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next.call(otherIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the `next` method to the `otherIter` object. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `next` method relies on the context of the original iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.skip
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `skip` method instead of `next`. This would cause the code to skip elements instead of iterating through them, leading to incorrect results or errors.

DONE.
