 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>this).get
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses TypeScript's type checking and allows any key to be used with the `get` method, potentially causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a bound function, changing the behavior of `this` within the `get` method, potentially causing issues if the method relies on correct `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(name: any) => this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `name` parameter with a constant `any` type, causing the `get` method to always look for a policy with the key `any`, which might not exist, and return `undefined`.

DONE.
