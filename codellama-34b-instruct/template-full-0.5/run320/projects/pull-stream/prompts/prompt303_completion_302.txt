  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, which means that the `read` function would be called with `true` instead of `false` when `ended` is `true`. This would cause the `read` function to return an error instead of the expected data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `ended` and `!end` are true. If `ended` is `true` but `!end` is `false`, the `read` function would be called with `true` instead of `false`, which would cause it to return an error instead of the expected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `ended` and `end` are true. If `ended` is `true`
