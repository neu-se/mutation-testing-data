  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(10, 0)` returns 1, whereas `0` is a constant value and would result in 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(10, 2)` returns 100, whereas `2` is a constant value and would result in 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(10, 1 + 1)` returns 100, whereas `1 + 1` is 2, which would result in 2.

DONE.
