  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter is being multiplied by 2, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object.

DONE.
