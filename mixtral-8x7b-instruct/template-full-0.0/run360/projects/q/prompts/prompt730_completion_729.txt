 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` expects an object with `index` and `value` properties, and passing `null` would not provide the necessary information for progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify({index: -1})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property is expected to be a non-negative integer, representing the index of the promise in the input array. Passing `-1` would cause incorrect progress updates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify({value: {}});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property should contain the progress update, which is expected to be a primitive value or a plain object. Passing an empty object would not provide the necessary information for progress updates.

DONE.
