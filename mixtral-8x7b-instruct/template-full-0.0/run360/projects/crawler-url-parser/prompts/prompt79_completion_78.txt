 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$("body a")'
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects all `a` elements within the `body` instead of the current selector which selects all `a` elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects only `a` elements with an `href` attribute, excluding any `a` elements without an `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a[target!="_blank"]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects only `a` elements with a `target` attribute that is not equal to `"_blank"`, excluding any `a` elements with a `target` attribute equal to `"_blank"`.

DONE.
