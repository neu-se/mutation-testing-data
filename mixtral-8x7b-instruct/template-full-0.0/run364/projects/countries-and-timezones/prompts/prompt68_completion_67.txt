 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null explicitly, while the original code checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(countries).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are no countries at all, rather than checking if a specific country is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.hasOwnProperty(country.id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the country object has the id property, rather than checking if the country object is defined.

DONE.
