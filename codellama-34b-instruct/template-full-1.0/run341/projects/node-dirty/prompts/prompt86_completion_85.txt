  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: " "
This would result in different behavior because the eof is checked differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `','`
This would result in different behavior because the csv is split differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `'X'`
This would result in different behavior because X is constant and not the linebreak.

DONE.
