  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject(new Error("test error")))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of being resolved with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of being resolved with the original value.

DONE.
