  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "apply" method on the promise, which would not be the same as calling the "dispatch" method on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "post" method on the promise, which would not be the same as calling the "dispatch" method on the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "delete" method on the promise, which would not be the same as calling the "dispatch" method on the promise.

DONE.
