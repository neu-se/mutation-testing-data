  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate in the opposite direction, starting from the end of the array instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, with `i` set to `this.length`, which would be out of bounds for the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate only while `i` is not equal to `this.length`, which would be true at most once, skipping the rest of the elements in the array.

DONE.
