  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add an extra degree to the longitude, which would cause the tile calculation to be off by one degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the longitude, which would cause the tile calculation to be off by a factor of two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract one degree from the longitude, which would cause the tile calculation to be off by
