Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.parse(src).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the root of the source path, rather than the destination path itself, potentially allowing incorrect directory structures to pass the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcParent
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the same as the source parent, rather than the root of the destination path, potentially causing the function to return prematurely without checking all parent directories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.parse(path.join(dest, '..')).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the parent of the destination parent is the root, rather than the destination parent itself, potentially allowing incorrect directory structures to pass the check due to the extra level of indirection.

DONE.
