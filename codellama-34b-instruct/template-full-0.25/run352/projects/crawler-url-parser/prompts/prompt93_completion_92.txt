  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the wrong arguments. The `href` argument should be a URL string, but it is being passed a cheerio object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr, href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the wrong arguments. The `baseUrlStr` argument should be a URL string, but it is being passed a cheerio object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with a null `baseUrlStr` argument, which would cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
