Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, while `push` adds it to the end, potentially altering the order in which tasks are executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array instead of adding a new task, which would lead to tasks not being executed as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes the first element of the array, which would skip the execution of the first task instead of adding a new one, disrupting the intended task flow.

DONE.
