  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildTimezone` takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passed one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass a third argument to `buildTimezone`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass a third argument to `buildTimezone`.

DONE.
