  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second-to-last operation in the delta with the new operation, rather than the last operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first operation in the delta with the new operation, rather than the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1].retain, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the retain property of the last operation in the delta with the new operation, rather than the last operation itself.

DONE.
