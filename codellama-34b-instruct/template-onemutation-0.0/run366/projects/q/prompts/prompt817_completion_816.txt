  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and the `rejected` argument is a function that is called with the rejection reason. By replacing `fulfilled` with `rejected`, the `done` method will be called with a rejection reason, even if the promise is fulfilled.
