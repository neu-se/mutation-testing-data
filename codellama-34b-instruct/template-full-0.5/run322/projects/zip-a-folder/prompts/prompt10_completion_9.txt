  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the code to enter the `else` branch even if `src` is a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the code to always enter the `else` branch regardless of the value of `src`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the code to always enter the `if` branch regardless of the value of `src`.

DONE.
