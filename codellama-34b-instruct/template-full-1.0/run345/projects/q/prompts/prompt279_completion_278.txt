  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Array(arguments).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because new Array() creates a shallow copy of the arguments object, while Array.prototype.slice() creates a shallow copy of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because Array.from() creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object, while Array.prototype.slice() creates a shallow copy of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spread.apply(arguments, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because spread() returns the elements of an array in a new array, while Array.prototype.slice() creates a shallow copy of the array.

DONE.
