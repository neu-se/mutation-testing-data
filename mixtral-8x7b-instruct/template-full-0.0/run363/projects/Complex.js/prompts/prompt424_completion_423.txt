 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the complex number's real part is zero, whereas the original code would return Complex.INFINITY.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Complex.ZERO when the real part of the complex number is greater than 1000, whereas the original code would return Complex.ZERO only when the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return Complex.ZERO when the real part of the complex number is exactly equal to Infinity, whereas the original code would return Complex.ZERO for any complex number with infinite magnitude.

DONE.
