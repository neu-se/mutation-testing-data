  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of an error, while the new code fragment would always return null, potentially hiding the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of an error, while the new code fragment would always return undefined, potentially hiding the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment caught the error and returned it, while the new code fragment would throw the error, potentially causing the program to crash.

DONE.
