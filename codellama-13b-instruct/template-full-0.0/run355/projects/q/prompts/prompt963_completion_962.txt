  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the current promise to the beginning of the arguments array, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with the current promise as the first argument instead of the `thisp` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(thisp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `thisp` argument to the beginning of the arguments array, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with the `thisp` argument as the first argument instead of the current promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(thisp, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add both the `thisp` argument and the current promise to the beginning of the arguments array, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with both arguments as the first argument instead of just the `this
