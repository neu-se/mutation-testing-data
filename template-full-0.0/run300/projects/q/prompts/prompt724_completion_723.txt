  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `null` in this case. This means that the promise returned by `all` would be resolved with an array of `null` values, rather than the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the callback function. This means that the promise returned by `all` would be rejected with the error, rather than resolved with the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("error")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that
