  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` is a function call, while `iter.peekType` is a property access. The function call would evaluate to the return value of the function, which is not necessarily the same as the property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` is a property access, while `iter.peekType()` is a function call. The property access would evaluate to the property value, which is not necessarily the same as the return value of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType` is a property access, while `otherIter.peekType()` is a function call. The property access would evaluate to the property value, which is not necessarily the same as
