  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the operation to advance by `length` units, rather than just one unit, which could lead to unexpected results when the operations are consumed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the operation to advance by `length` units in the other iteration, rather than just one unit, which could lead to unexpected results when the operations are consumed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the operation to advance by 1 unit for every operation consumed, rather than just one unit, which could lead to unexpected results when the operations are consumed.

DONE.
