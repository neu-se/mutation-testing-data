Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last rule from the `rules` array instead of adding new rules, potentially altering the policy's access control logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift(...rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds the new rules to the beginning of the `rules` array instead of the end, which may change the order in which rules are evaluated during the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules = rules
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely replaces the existing `rules` array with the new rules provided, discarding any previously defined rules in the policy.

DONE.
