  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error object, while this replacement throws the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error with a specific message, while this replacement throws an error with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while this replacement does not throw any error.

DONE.
