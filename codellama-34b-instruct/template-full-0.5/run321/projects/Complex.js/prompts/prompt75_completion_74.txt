  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping over the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 instead of 0, potentially causing the loop to never execute or to access elements outside of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as NaN is not a valid array index.

DONE.
