Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` immediately resolves the promise with no arguments, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` creates a function that expects a Node-style callback, which will be called with the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))` will immediately reject the promise with a custom error message, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is intended to create a resolver function for handling the result of the asynchronous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing it with `null` means that no callback function is provided, which will lead to the promise being unresolved and potentially cause the operation to hang, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` provides a proper callback mechanism for handling the result.

DONE.
