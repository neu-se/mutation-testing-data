  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `typeof` operator to check if `ses` was defined, while this new code uses the strict equality operator `===` to check if `ses` is equal to `undefined`. The `typeof` operator returns a string representing the type of a variable, while the strict equality operator checks if the values of two variables are the same. In this case, if `ses` is not defined, then the original code would return `true`, while the new code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `typeof` operator to check if `ses` was defined, while this new code uses the `undefined` value to check if `ses` is not equal to `undefined`. The `typeof` operator returns a string representing the type of a variable, while the `undefined` value represents the absence of a value. In this case, if `
