  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but it is being used in the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions. By using `options.encoding` instead of `options`, we are changing the behavior of the function to use the encoding specified in the options object, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but it is being used in the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions. By using `options.throws` instead of `options`, we are changing the behavior of the function to use the `throws` property specified in the options object, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
