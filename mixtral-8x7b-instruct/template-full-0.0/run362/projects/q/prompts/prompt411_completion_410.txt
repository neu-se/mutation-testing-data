 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the context instead of using the default `<PLACEHOLDER>` value, potentially causing issues if the `inspect` method relies on the context (`this`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `true` as the context instead of using the default `<PLACEHOLDER>` value, potentially causing issues if the `inspect` method relies on the context (`this`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspectedValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `inspectedValue` property instead of calling the `inspect` method, potentially causing issues if the `inspect` method performs additional logic or error handling.

DONE.
