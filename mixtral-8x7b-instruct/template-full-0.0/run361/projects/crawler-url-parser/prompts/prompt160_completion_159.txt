 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^\/]*$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes everything after the last slash, including the slash, instead of keeping the last slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/(\/[^\/]*)*$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches zero or more occurrences of a slash followed by one or more non-slash characters, instead of just one occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/(\/[^\/]*)+[\/]?$/, ""
