  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the operands for subtraction, and it creates a new behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello" + "world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the operands for subtraction, and it creates a new behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[] + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the operands for subtraction, and it creates a new behavior.

DONE.
