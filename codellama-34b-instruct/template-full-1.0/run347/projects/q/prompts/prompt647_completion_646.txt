  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a string that is allowed by the Q.dispatch function. The function expects the second argument to be either "get", "set", "delete" or "post" and throws a TypeError when the argument does not have one of these values

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"SET"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is not the same as "SET" and the function will throw a TypeError when the argument does not have the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is not the same as undefined and the function will throw a TypeError when the argument does not have the expected value.

DONE.
