  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `a` argument is a function with a length of 1, while the new code fragment checks if the `a` argument is a function with a length of 2. This change would cause the function to behave differently when the `a` argument is a function with a length of 1, as it would not satisfy the condition and the function would not be executed.

DONE.
