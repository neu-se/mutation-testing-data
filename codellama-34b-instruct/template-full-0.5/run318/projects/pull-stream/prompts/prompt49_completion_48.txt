  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 0 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to execute one more time than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one more time than intended, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the end of the array instead of the beginning, potentially causing the loop to execute in the opposite order than intended.

DONE.
