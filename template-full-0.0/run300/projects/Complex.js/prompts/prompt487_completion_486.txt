  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() {
  return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']());
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would always return `true`, even if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isFinite = function() {
  return isFinite(this['re']) && isFinite(this['im']);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method would always return `false`, even if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isNaN = function() {
  return isNaN(this['re']) || isNaN(this['im']);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method
