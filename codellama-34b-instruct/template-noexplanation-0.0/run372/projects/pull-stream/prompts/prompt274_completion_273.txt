  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream)
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called multiple times, which will result in the `stream` variable being overwritten and the `flatten` function returning a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.once()
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called only once, which will result in the `stream` variable being overwritten and the `flatten` function returning a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.once(function() {})
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to be called only once, and the `stream` variable will be overwritten with a new stream that is the result of calling the `once` method on the original stream. This will result in the `flatten` function returning a different value than expected.

DONE.
