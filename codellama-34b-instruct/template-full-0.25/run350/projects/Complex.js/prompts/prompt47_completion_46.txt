  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `false` even if `a` has the required properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && !('arg' in a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression now checks for the absence of the `arg` property instead of its presence, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` even if `a` does not have the required properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression now uses the logical OR operator instead of the logical AND operator, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` if either `a` or `b` has the required properties, instead of requiring both `a` and `b
