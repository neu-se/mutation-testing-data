  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_ slice(array_slice.call(arguments), 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is not a function and would throw an error, causing the program to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply to the third argument and beyond, and would not affect the first two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply to the second argument and before, and would not affect the last argument.

DONE.
