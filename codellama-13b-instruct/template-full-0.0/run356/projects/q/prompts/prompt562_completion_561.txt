  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(object, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is used to handle the result of the `Q.async` function, which is a promise for the return value of the generator function. In the original code, the `Q.async` function is used directly, which means that the result of the generator function is not handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(object, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` function is used to handle the result of the `Q.async` function, which is a promise for the return value of the generator function. In the original code, the `Q.async` function is used directly, which means that the result of the generator function is not handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread(object, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior
