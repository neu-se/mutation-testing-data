  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("I'm a bug!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of returning a value, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "I'm a bug!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string instead of a value, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return undefined instead of a value, which would cause the program to produce incorrect output.

DONE.
