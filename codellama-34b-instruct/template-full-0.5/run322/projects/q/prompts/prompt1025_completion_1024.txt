  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function expression that would be called instead of the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` instead of the original function.

DONE.
