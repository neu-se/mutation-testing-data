  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.valueOf.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method is called instead of `promiseDispatch`, which could potentially have different effects on the program's logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is used instead of `newPromise`, which could potentially have different effects on the program's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function is called instead of `promiseDispatch`, which could potentially have different effects on the program's logic.

DONE.
