  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args` by itself would pass the original array as an argument to `value.apply()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of the `args` array and any additional arguments passed to it, whereas `args` by itself would pass the original array as an argument to `value.apply()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array where each element is the result of applying the provided function to the corresponding element of the original array, whereas `args` by itself would pass the original array as an argument to `value.apply()`.
