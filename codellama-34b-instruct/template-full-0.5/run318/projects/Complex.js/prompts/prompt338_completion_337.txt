  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the modified code fragment `0` would return the value `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the modified code fragment `-1` would return the value `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the modified code fragment `a + 1` would return the value `a + 1`.

DONE.
