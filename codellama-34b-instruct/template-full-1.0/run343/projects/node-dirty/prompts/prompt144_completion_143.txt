  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--this._inFlightWrites >= 0 && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used Less-than-or-equal-to operator ` <= 0` however, in this option, it has been replaced with Greater-Than-or-equal-to operator `>= 0`, which has different behavior under different scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--this._waitForDrain && !(this._inFlightWrites > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the logical statement in the original code fragment, changing the original behavior. It also replaces the Less-than-or-equal-to operator with Greater-Than operator `> 0`, which changes the comparison performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
---!this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
