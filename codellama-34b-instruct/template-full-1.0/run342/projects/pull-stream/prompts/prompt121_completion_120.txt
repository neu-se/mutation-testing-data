  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` function immediately with a `null` argument, rather than waiting for the `source` function to provide the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc += data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `acc` variable differently than the original code fragment, which would only update it if the `data` argument was not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reducer` function with a different argument order than the original code fragment.

DONE.
