  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Promise.prototype` object, instead of `undefined`, which could cause the `all()` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and passing it to the `all()` function would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a promise, and passing it to the `all()` function would cause an error.

DONE.
