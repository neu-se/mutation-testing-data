  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether there are more ops in the iterator, while `hasNext` is a property that returns the next op in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator than `thisIter`, and `hasNext` would return the next op in the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next op in the iterator, while `hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more ops in the iterator.

DONE.
