 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the special cases for `b` being 1 or -1 would not be checked when `a` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` for non-zero values of `a`, skipping the special cases for `b` being 1 or -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division by zero error when `a` is not equal to 0, whereas the original condition does not cause an error.

DONE.
