Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' ? 1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the length used for the operation based on the type of the next operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations when composing deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the other iterator plus one, which could cause an off-by-one error in the length calculation, leading to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it ensures that the length is always non-negative, which could mask issues where the length should actually be zero or negative, affecting the logic of how operations are composed.

DONE.
