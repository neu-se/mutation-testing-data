  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.skip
```
This would result in different behavior because `skip` would cause the iterator to move past the current operation, while `next` would retrieve the current operation and move the iterator forward.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` would retrieve the next operation without advancing the iterator, while `next` would retrieve the current operation and advance the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.forEach(() => {
  // do nothing
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` would loop over all operations in the iterator, while `next` would retrieve the current operation and move the iterator forward.

DONE.
