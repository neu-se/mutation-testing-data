  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `domain`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `false` if `domain` is truthy, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if `domain` is falsy, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`.

DONE.
