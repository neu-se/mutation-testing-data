  Option 1:
```
1/x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `x` directly, while the replaced code fragment would use the reciprocal of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the value of `x`, while the replaced code fragment would multiply `x` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the value of `x`, while the replaced code fragment would add 1 to `x`.

DONE.
