Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^http:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match URLs that start with "http://" instead of matching any URL that starts with "//", potentially causing valid URLs to be incorrectly modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\w+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match URLs that start with a forward slash followed by one or more word characters, which could lead to incorrect handling of URLs that should be prefixed with "http://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^ftp:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match URLs that start with "ftp://" instead of matching any URL that starts with "//", which would prevent the normalization of other valid protocols.

DONE.
