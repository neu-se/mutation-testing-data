  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the host of the link URL is the same as the host of the page URL, while this new code fragment checks if they are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host === pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the host of the link URL is the same as the host of the page URL, while this new code fragment checks if they are not the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.length != pageurl.host.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the host of the link URL is the same as the host of the page URL, while this new code fragment checks if the length of the host of the link URL is not the same as the length of the host of the page URL.

DONE.
