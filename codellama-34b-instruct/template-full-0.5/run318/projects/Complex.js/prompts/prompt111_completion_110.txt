  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isNaN` operator would return `false` if the value is `NaN`, which would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called, even if the value is not `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function would return `true` if the value is a finite number, which would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called, even if the value is not a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function would return `true` if the value is `NaN`, which would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called, even if the value is not `NaN`.

DONE.
