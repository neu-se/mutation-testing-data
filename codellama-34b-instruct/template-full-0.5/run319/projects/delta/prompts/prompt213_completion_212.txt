  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the delta is constructed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` is a different object than `delta`, and it would change the way the delta is constructed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the delta is constructed.

DONE.
