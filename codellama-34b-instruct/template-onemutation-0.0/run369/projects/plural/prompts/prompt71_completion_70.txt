  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'cellos'`, which is a plural noun. The pluralization function would return a different result for these two inputs.

DONE.
