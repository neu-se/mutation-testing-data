  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, the comparison is using the "===" operator, which checks for both value and type equality. In this suggestion, the "==" operator is used, which only checks for value equality, which could result in false positives or false negatives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the "!" operator negates the expression, which would cause the comparison to always evaluate to false, even if b is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, the comparison is using the "===" operator, which checks for both value and type equality. In this suggestion, the "!==" operator is used, which checks for inequality, which could result in false positives or false negatives.

DONE.
