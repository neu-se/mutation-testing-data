  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : options
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is not defined, `null` will be used instead of `options`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is not defined, `undefined` will be used instead of `options`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : options.reviver + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is defined, `options.reviver + 1` will be used instead of `options.reviver`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to fail.

DONE.
