  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the descriptor object's property to a new function that does nothing, which would likely cause the promise to resolve with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the descriptor object's property to null, which would likely cause the promise to reject with a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () { throw new Error() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the descriptor object's property to a new function that throws an error, which would likely cause the promise to reject with the error.

DONE.
