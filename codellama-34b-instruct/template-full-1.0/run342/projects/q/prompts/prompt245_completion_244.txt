  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longStackCounter++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `longStackCounter` variable, which is used to track the number of stack traces in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shortStackCounter++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment a non-existent `shortStackCounter` variable, which would cause an error and potentially break the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackCounter++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment a non-existent `stackCounter` variable, which would also cause an error and potentially break the promise chain.

DONE.
