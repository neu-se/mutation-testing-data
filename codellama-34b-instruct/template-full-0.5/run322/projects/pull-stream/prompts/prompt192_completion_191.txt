  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.call(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `map` function to the current object, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.apply(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `map` function to the current object, and also pass the `data` argument as an array of arguments to the `map` function, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.bind(this)(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the current object and the `data` argument, which may not be intended.

DONE.
