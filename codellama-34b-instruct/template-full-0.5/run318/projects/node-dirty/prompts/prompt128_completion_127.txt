  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is a method that uncorks the stream, allowing it to resume writing, whereas `cork` is a method that corks the stream, preventing it from writing. Using `uncork` instead of `cork` would cause the stream to write data even if it is not ready to do so, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `write` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `cork` is a method that corks the stream, preventing it from writing. Using `write` instead of `cork` would cause the stream to write data even if it is not ready to do so, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(
