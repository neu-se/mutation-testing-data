  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to include an extra element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to exclude the previous element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to include an extra element and exclude the previous element.

DONE.
