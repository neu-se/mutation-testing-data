  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied even if the other delta has an `insert` operation at the same position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be applied even if the other delta has an `insert` operation at the same position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied even if the other delta has an `insert` operation with a length greater than 0.

DONE.
