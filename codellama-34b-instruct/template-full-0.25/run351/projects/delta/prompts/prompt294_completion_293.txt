  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current element and move to the next one, potentially causing the loop to miss an iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move back to the previous element, potentially causing the loop to iterate over the same element multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move to the element at twice the current index, potentially causing the loop to skip over elements or iterate over them multiple times.

DONE.
