  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `priority`, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `arg`, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `arg` by 2, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

DONE.
