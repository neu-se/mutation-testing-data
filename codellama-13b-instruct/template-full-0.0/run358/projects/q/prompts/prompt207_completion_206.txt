  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" &&
            typeof console.warn === "function" &&
            console.warn("Q is deprecated, use Q.Promise instead.", new Error("").stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print a warning message to the console when the `Q` function is called, indicating that it is deprecated and suggesting using `Q.Promise` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" &&
            typeof console.warn === "function" &&
            console.warn("Q is deprecated, use Q.Promise instead.", new Error("").stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print a warning message to the console when the `Q` function is called, indicating that it is deprecated and suggesting using `Q.Promise` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" &&
            typeof console.warn === "function" &&
