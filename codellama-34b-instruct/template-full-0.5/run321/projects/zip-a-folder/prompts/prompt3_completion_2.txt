  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` property is changed from `'tar'` to `'zip'`, which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', archiverOptions: {gzip: true}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archiverOptions` property is changed to include the `gzip` option, which would result in the archive being compressed using gzip instead of the default compression algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', archiverOptions: {zlib: {level: 9}}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archiverOptions` property is changed to include the `zlib` option with a level
