  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for deep equality, while `===` checks for reference equality. If the attributes are different objects with the same properties, `===` would return `false`, while `isEqual` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.length === lastOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the attributes array, rather than the attributes themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.every((attr, i) => attr === lastOp.attributes[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check that every attribute in `newOp.attributes` is equal to the corresponding attribute in `lastOp.attributes`, rather than checking if the two arrays are equal.

DONE.
