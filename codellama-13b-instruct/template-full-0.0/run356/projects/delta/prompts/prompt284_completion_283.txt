  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character is not a valid JavaScript identifier, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value is not a valid JavaScript identifier, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value is not a valid JavaScript identifier, and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
