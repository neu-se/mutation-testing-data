  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is a different property than `a['abs']`, and it is not clear how this change would affect the overall behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['re']` is a different property than `a['abs']`, and it is not clear how this change would affect the overall behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['im']` is a different property than `a['abs']`, and it is not clear how this change would affect the overall behavior of the program.

DONE.
