  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), whereas `Math.pow` returns the base to the power of the exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the base to the power of the exponent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log()` returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the base to the power of the exponent.

DONE.
