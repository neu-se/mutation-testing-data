  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method to check if the path matches the regex, and the new code uses the `match` method to get the matched substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(this.regex, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method to check if the path matches the regex, and the new code uses the `replace` method to replace the matched substring with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method to check if the path matches the regex, and the new code uses the `split` method to split the path on the regex.

DONE.
