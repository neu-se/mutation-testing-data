  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero()` checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is the real part of the complex number, and checking if it is equal to zero would not take into account the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is the imaginary part of the complex number, and checking if it is equal to zero would not take into account the real part.

DONE.
