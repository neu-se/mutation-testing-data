  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith()` checks if the `linkurl_path` starts with the `pageurl_path`, whereas `includes()` checks if the `linkurl_path` contains the `pageurl_path` anywhere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `pageurl_path` contains the `linkurl_path`, which is the opposite of the original check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` checks if the `pageurl_path` is at the beginning of the `linkurl_path`, whereas `includes()` checks if the `pageurl_path` is present anywhere in the `linkurl_path`.
