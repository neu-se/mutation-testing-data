  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a reference to a function, while `read + 1` would be a reference to a different function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a reference to a function, while `read.source` would be a reference to a different function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a reference to a function, while `read.sink` would be a reference to a different function.

DONE.
