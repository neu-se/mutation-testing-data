  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `JSON.parse()` method to parse the `rowStr` string as a JSON object, but the modified code fragment is using the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the `rowStr` string to uppercase. This would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail, and the `row` variable would be set to `undefined`, which would result in different behavior in the code that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `JSON.parse()` method to parse the `rowStr` string as a JSON object, but the modified code fragment is using the `split()` method to split the `rowStr` string into an array of substrings using a comma as the delimiter. This would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail, and the `row` variable would be set to `undefined`, which would result
