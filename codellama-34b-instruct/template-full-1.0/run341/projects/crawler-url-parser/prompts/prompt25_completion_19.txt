  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in the string " " being treated as a regular expression, which would result in a TypeError because the second argument to `replace` must be a string or a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in the code passing the `undefined` value as the second argument to `replace`, which would result in a TypeError because the second argument must be a string or a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in the code passing the `null` value as the second argument to `replace`, which would result in a TypeError because the second argument must be a string or a function.

DONE.
