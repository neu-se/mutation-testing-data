Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` to the `values` function instead of the actual `stream`, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to process the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a constant integer `42` to the `values` function instead of the actual `stream`, which would likely cause the flattening logic to fail or behave incorrectly since `42` is not a valid input for the expected stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values('string')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a string `'string'` to the `values` function instead of the actual `stream`, which would not be a valid input for the flattening process and could lead to incorrect handling of the data.

DONE.
