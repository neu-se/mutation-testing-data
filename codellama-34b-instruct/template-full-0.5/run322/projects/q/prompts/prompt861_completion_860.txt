  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is equal to `undefined`, while this code fragment checks if it is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is equal to `undefined`, while this code fragment checks if it is equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is equal to `undefined`, while this code fragment checks if it is not equal to `null`.

DONE.
