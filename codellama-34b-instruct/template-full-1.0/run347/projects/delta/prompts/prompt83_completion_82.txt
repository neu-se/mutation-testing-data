  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.is(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.is()` is a strict comparison method that checks for both value and type equality, whereas `isEqual()` only checks for value equality. This could cause the algorithm to produce different results if the attributes have different types but the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(newOp.attributes) === JSON.stringify(lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` converts the attributes to a string representation before comparing them, whereas `isEqual()` compares the attributes as objects. This could cause the algorithm to produce different results if the attributes have different internal structures but the same string representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `isEqual()` comparison with a direct reference comparison. This would cause the
