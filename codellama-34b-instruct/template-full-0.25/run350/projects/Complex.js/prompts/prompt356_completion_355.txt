  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `b`, which refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a` refers to the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `b`, which refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `c` is a new variable that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `b`, which refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `0` is a constant value that is not related to the complex number.

DONE.
