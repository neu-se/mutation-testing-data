  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the `end` variable and passes the `data` variable to the `cb` function if it is not set, while this modified code fragment always passes `null` as the `data` parameter, regardless of whether the `end` variable is set or not. This could cause issues if the `map` function is relying on the behavior of passing the `data` parameter to the `cb` function only if `end` is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the `end` variable and passes the `data` variable to the `cb` function if it is not set, while this modified code fragment always passes the negation of the `end` variable as the `data` parameter, regardless of whether `end` is set or not. This could cause issues if the `map` function is relying on the behavior of passing the `data` parameter to
