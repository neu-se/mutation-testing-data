  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function that is not called in the original code fragment, and calling it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and adding 1 to it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it with a different `this` value would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
