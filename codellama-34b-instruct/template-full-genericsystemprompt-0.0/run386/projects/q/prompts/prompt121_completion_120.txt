  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `i < 0` would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute indefinitely, as the condition `i < 0` would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute a random number of times, as the condition `i < 0` would be true a random number of times.

DONE.
