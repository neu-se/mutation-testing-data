  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make a GET request instead of a POST request, which could cause the code to fail if the server expects a POST request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send an empty object as the request body, which could cause the server to respond with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url, { foo: 'bar' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a request body with a different key-value pair, which could cause the server to respond with an error or different results.

DONE.
