  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because the map function returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. The original code uses the filter function to logically test each operation in the delta's array of operations and returns a new array with only the filters by those tests, instead of returning a new array of generic objects that transform the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because forEach does not return a new filtered array, unlike filter. filter is used to step through an array and execute a function on each iteration. In this particular case, forEach would not return a new array that holds only the items that satisfy the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because reduce is used to take in an array, a combining function, and an initial value, and returns a single output
