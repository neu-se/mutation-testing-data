Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index `i` by 1 every time the predicate is called, potentially causing the line count to be off by one compared to the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the index `i` by 2, leading to an incorrect line index being passed to the predicate, which could affect how lines are processed or displayed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the index `i` to 0 every time the predicate is called, causing the line count to always start from zero, which could lead to incorrect processing of lines.

DONE.
