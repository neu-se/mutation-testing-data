  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `this['isInfinite']()` means that the expression would evaluate to `true` only when the divisor is not infinite, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression inside the parentheses would evaluate to `true` only when the divisor is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `z['isInfinite']()` means that the expression would evaluate to `true` only when the dividend is not infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
