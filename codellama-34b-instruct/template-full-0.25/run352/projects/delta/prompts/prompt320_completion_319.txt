  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different operation than `op.retain`, and would cause the `retain` method to delete the specified number of characters instead of retaining them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more character than the original code, potentially causing the `retain` method to retain more characters than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one fewer character than the original code, potentially causing the `retain` method to retain fewer characters than intended.

DONE.
