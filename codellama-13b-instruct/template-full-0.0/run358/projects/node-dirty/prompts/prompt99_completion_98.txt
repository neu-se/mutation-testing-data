  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when a corrupted row is encountered, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when a corrupted row is encountered, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when a corrupted row is encountered, which would cause the program to crash.

DONE.
