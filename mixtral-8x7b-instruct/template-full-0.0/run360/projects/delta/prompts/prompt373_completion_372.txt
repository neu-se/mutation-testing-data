 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, while the original code fragment `thisIter.next()` advances the iterator. This change could cause an infinite loop if the peeked operation is an insertion, as the loop condition checks for `thisIter.hasNext()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(0)` returns the current operation without advancing the iterator, effectively skipping the next operation. This change could lead to unexpected behavior in the transformed delta, as some operations might be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.previous()` is not a valid method on the OpIterator class, and it
