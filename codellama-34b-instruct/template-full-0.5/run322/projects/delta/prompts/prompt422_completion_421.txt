  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code subtracts the offset from the index, while this replacement adds the offset to the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code subtracts the offset from the index, while this replacement multiplies the index by the offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index / offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code subtracts the offset from the index, while this replacement divides the index by the offset.

DONE.
