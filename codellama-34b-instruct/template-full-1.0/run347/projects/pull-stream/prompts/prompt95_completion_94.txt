  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data && null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `data` is falsy, while the original code would return the original `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if `data` is truthy, while the original code would return the original `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `data` is `null`, while the original code would return the original `data`.

DONE.
