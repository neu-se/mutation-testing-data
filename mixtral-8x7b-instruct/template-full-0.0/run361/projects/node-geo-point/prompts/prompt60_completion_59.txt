 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the correct function to use, but the original code uses a variable `sin` which is not defined in the provided code. This would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the sine function with the number 1 would significantly alter the calculation of the new longitude value, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)
