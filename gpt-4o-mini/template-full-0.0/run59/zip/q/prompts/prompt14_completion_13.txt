Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ses.ok` is not strictly equal to `true`, which would return `true` if `ses.ok` is `false`, `undefined`, or any other value, potentially allowing the code to execute when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isReady
```
This would result in different behavior because it references a different property (`isReady`) of the `ses` object, which may not exist or may have a different meaning, leading to unexpected behavior in the execution flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ses.ok` is strictly equal to `false`, which would allow the code to execute only if `ses.ok` is `false`, potentially preventing execution when it should proceed if `ses.ok` is `true`.

DONE.
