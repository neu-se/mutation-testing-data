  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This change will also cause the `cos` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially reveal a weakness in the test suite.

DONE.
