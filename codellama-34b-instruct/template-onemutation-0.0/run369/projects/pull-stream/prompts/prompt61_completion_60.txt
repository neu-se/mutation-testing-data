  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `read` function with two arguments, `null` and a callback function, while the mutated code fragment uses the `read` function with two arguments, `abort` or `true` and a callback function. This change could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently, depending on the implementation of the function and the values of `abort` and `done`.

DONE.
