  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the current component, rather than by the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the current component, rather than by the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator to the next operation, rather than to the next component.

DONE.
