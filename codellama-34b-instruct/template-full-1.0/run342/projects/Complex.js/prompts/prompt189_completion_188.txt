  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `a` to be equal to `b`, which would cause the `if` statement to always be true, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making it check whether `a` is not equal to `b`, which would cause the `if` statement to always be false, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `a` is greater than `b`, which would cause the `if` statement to be true only if `a` is greater than `b`, but it would still be true if `a` is equal to `b`.

DONE.
