  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 3)` to remove the last three characters. This would cause the function to return a different plural form for words that end in "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", or "cactus".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' });
```
This would result in different
