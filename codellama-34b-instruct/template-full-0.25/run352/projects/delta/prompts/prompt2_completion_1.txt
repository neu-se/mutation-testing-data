  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is null. If `b` is null, the original code would return an empty object, while this replacement would return `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is not an instance of the `Object` constructor. If `b` is not an instance of `Object`, the original code would return an empty object, while this replacement would return `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(b, 'constructor')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` does not have a `constructor
