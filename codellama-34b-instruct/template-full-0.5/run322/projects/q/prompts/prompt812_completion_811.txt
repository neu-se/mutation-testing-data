  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is called with a `null` context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is called with a different context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is called with a different argument, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
