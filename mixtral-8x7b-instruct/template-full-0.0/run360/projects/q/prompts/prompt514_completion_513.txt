 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object's resolve function would be called immediately, instead of waiting for the promise returned by `promise.then` to resolve. This could cause issues if the rest of the code expects the deferred object's resolve function to be called asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use Q's defer method instead of the native Promise. This could cause issues if the rest of the codebase is not using Q promises consistently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object's resolve function would be called immediately with a null value, instead of waiting for the promise returned by `promise.then` to resolve. This could cause issues if the rest of the code expects the deferred object'
