  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) + Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the product of `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`, which produces a result that is not equal to the sum of the two functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) - Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the product of `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`, which produces a result that is not equal to the difference of the two functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the product of `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`, which produces a result that is not equal to the product of the two functions.

DONE.
