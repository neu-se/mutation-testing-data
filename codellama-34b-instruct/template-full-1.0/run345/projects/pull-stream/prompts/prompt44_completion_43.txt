  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid object, and would cause a `TypeError` when the function is called with `pull.apply(undefined, ref)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `null` to check if the `ref` argument is null or undefined, and using `ref` directly to pass it as an argument to `pull.apply()`. If we replace `null` with `null`, the check for `ref` being null or undefined would still pass, but the `pull.apply()` call would fail because `null` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[], ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is not a valid object, and would cause a `TypeError` when the function is called with `pull.apply([], ref)`.

DONE.
