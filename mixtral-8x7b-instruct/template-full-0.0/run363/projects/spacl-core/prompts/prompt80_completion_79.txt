 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule['matches']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses array-like access to access the `matches` method, which would work but is not the standard way of accessing object methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method of the `rule` object, which would not have the same effect as the original `rule.matches` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule['query']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses array-like access to access the `query` method, which would work but is not the standard way of accessing object methods.

DONE.
