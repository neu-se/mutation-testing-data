  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of unhandled rejections, rather than the array of unhandled rejections themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first unhandled rejection, rather than the array of unhandled rejections themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the array of unhandled rejections, rather than the array itself.

DONE.
