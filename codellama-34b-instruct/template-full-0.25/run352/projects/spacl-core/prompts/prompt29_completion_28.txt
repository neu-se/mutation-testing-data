  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.join` is a method that joins the elements of an array into a string, whereas `parts.reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array and returns a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `parts.reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array and returns a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.splice` is a method that adds or removes elements from an array, whereas `parts.reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array and returns a single value.

DONE.
