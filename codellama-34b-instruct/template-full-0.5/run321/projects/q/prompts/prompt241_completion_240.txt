  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that may have a different implementation than `isPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would invert the result of `isPromise`, potentially causing the `coerce` function to be called instead of `fulfill`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `isPromiseAlike` would cause the `coerce` function to be called only if the value is both a promise and a promise-like object, whereas the original code would call `coerce` if the value is only a promise-like object.

DONE.
