  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `number` and `object` types, while this replacement only checks for `number`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null && op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for `object` type, while this replacement also checks for `null` and `undefined` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null && op.retain !== undefined && op.retain !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for `object` type, while this replacement also checks for `null`, `undefined`, and `string` values.

DONE.
