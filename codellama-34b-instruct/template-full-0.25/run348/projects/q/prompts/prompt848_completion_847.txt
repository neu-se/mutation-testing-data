  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with the argument `1`, which would cause it to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `1`, rather than a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with the argument `null`, which would cause it to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, rather than a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with the argument `undefined`, which would cause it to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than a new deferred object.

DONE.
