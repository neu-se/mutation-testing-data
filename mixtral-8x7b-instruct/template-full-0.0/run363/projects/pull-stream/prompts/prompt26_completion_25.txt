 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.bind(null, read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses [].concat instead of the spread operator, which may result in different behavior when dealing with arrays or objects with custom `.length` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.bind(pull, null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.prototype.apply` instead of `Function.prototype.call`, which may result in different behavior when handling context (`this`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(...args) => pull.apply(null, [...ref, ...args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a rest parameter and spread operator, which may result in different behavior when handling arrays or objects with custom `.length` properties.

These changes introduce different behaviors that may
