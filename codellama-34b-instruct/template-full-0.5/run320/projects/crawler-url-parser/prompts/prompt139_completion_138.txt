  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of `/index.[a-z]+$`, while the new code fragment replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with `/`, while the new code fragment replaces the match with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because
