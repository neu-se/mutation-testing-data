 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function would no longer check if the current index is a property of the array, and would always reduce the array starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function would reduce the array up to the second-to-last element, ignoring the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0 in this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function would always start reducing the array from the first element, even if it is not present in the array (since `0 in this` would be `true` for sparse arrays).

DONE.
