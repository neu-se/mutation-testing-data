  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"custom reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string " custom reason " is passed as the rejection reason, instead of the original reason object, which could be a complex object with additional properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value is passed as the rejection reason, instead of the original reason object. This could cause the promise to be fulfilled with a null value, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("custom reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because the "custom reason" string is passed as the rejection reason, instead of the original reason object. This could result in a different error message being thrown, which could lead to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
