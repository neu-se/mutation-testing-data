  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the callback to be called with `null` and `null` instead of `err` and `null` when `err` is not equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the callback to be called with `null` and `null` instead of `err` and `null` when `err` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? err : null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the callback to be called with `err` and `null` instead of `err` and `null` when `err` is truthy
