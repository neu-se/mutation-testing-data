  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 || b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator, while this option uses a logical OR operator. This would cause the code to execute the `return` statement in the `if` block if either `a` or `b` is less than 3000, whereas the original code would only execute the `return` statement if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator, while this option uses a logical AND operator with a negated condition for `b`. This would cause the code to execute the `return` statement in the `if` block if `a` is less than 3000 and `b` is greater than 3000, whereas the original code would only
