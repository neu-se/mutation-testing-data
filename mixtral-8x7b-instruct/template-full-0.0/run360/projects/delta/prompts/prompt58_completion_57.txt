 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.includes(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the newOp already exists in the ops array using the 'includes' method, which returns a boolean instead of unconditionally inserting the newOp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length > index
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there is any op already present at the given index, instead of checking if the index is equal to the length of the ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op === newOp).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the newOp already exists in the ops array by filtering the array and checking the length of the resulting filtered array, which returns a boolean instead of unconditionally inserting the newOp.

DONE.
