  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `sinh` function to return the opposite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be passed the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be passed a different argument.

DONE.
