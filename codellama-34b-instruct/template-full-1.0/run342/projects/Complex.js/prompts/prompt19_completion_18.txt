  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `y` variable, but the replacement code fragment uses the `x` variable instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `y` variable, but the replacement code fragment uses the `a` variable instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `y` variable, but the replacement code fragment uses the `b` variable instead.

DONE.
