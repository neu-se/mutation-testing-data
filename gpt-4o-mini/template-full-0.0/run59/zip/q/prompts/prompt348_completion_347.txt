Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of handling the exception and rejecting the promise, it simply logs the exception to the console, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with the exception instead of rejecting it, which would change the expected flow of error handling in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Custom error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error instead of passing the original exception, which could obscure the original error context and lead to confusion in debugging.

DONE.
