  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "person". Replacing it with `'person'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "person". Replacing it with `'peoples'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "person". Replacing it with `'persons'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
