Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation instead of just peeking at the current one, potentially altering the flow of the iteration and affecting how lines are processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the next operation instead of the operation itself, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operation if the type does not match the expected 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds one to the length of the next operation, which could cause the iteration to skip or incorrectly process operations, leading to unexpected results in the delta.

DONE.
