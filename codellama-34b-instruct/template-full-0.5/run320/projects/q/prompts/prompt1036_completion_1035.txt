  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise. This change would cause the `put` method to return a rejected promise instead of a pending one, which could break the code that uses the `put` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise. This change would cause the `put` method to return a resolved promise instead of a pending one, which could break the code that uses the `put` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise. This change would cause the `
