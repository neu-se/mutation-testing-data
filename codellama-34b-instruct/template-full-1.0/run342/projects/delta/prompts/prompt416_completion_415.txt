  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nextType === 'insert' && offset < index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `(offset < index)` would be missing, which would cause the `offset` variable to be updated incorrectly in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nextType === 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `(nextType === 'delete')` would be added, which would cause the `index` variable to be updated incorrectly in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nextType === 'insert' && priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `(priority)` would be added, which would cause the `offset` variable to be updated incorrectly in certain cases.

DONE.
