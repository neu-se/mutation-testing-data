 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, whereas the original code checks the length of `laterQueue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns null, which would cause an error if used in a context that expects a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new statement to the code, which would cause a syntax error in this context.

DONE.
