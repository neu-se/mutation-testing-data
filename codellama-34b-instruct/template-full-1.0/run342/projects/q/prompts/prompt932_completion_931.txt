  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var
```
This would result in different behavior because `var` is a keyword in JavaScript, and the original code fragment did not use any keywords.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a number, and the original code fragment did not use any numeric literals.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and the original code fragment did not use any object literals.

DONE.
