  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates the end of the stream, while `null` is a null value that does not indicate the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates the end of the stream, while `undefined` is a value that does not indicate the end of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates the end of the stream, while `true` is a boolean value that indicates the end of the stream, but it is not the same as the `end` variable.

DONE.
