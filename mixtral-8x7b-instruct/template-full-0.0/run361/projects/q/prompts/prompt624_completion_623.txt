 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always resolve to a promise that is fulfilled with `null`, instead of setting the value of the property on the target object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always reject with an error message, instead of setting the value of the property on the target object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Unexpected invocation') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would throw an error when it is invoked, instead of setting the value of the property on the target object. This simulates a situation where the method is not properly implemented.

DONE.
