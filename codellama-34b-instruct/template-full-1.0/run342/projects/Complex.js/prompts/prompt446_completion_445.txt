  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.floor() and Math.round() behave differently, especially when dealing with decimal numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil() and Math.round() behave differently, especially when dealing with decimal numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.random() generates a random number between 0 and 1, whereas Math.round() and Math.floor() both return an integer value.

DONE.
