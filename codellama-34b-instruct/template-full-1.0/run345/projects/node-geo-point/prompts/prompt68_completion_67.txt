  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the bearing
would always be 0, causing the destination point to be the same as the
origin point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the bearing
would always be negative, causing the destination point to be on the opposite
side of the origin point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(inthething(itheraces))
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the bearing
would be affected by the behavior of the `inthething` and `itheraces` functions,
which are not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
