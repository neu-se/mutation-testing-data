  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash (/) as a delimiter, but the new code fragment is using the backslash (\\) as a delimiter. This would cause the code to behave differently when parsing URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash (/) as a delimiter, but the new code fragment is using the backslash (\\) as a delimiter. This would cause the code to behave differently when parsing URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash (/) as a delimiter, but the new code fragment is using the backslash (\\) as a delimiter. This would cause the code to behave differently when parsing URLs.

DONE.
