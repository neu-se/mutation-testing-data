  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return the original word instead of the expected plural form, resulting in a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return the correct plural form for the word "memo", but it will also add a new rule to the `rules` array, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return the correct plural form for the word "memo", and it will also add a new rule to the `rules` array that uses a function to determine the plural form.

DONE.
