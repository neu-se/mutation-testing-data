  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator `!` would flip the truthiness of the expression, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `zipAFolderOptions` and `customWriteStream` are both defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?.` optional chaining operator would evaluate to `undefined` if `zipAFolderOptions` is `undefined`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `customWriteStream` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would always evaluate to `true` if `zipAFolder
