 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, and checking for `null` will always return `false` since operation objects are never `null`. This change would cause the `slice` method to return a Delta object with no operations, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is a next operation in the iterator. However, the original code uses `iter.hasNext()` in the while loop condition, so replacing it with the same expression would not change the behavior. Instead, let's replace it with a different expression that always returns `true`:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would never terminate, causing the `slice` method to enter an infinite loop and eventually crash the program.
