  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` value would be increased by 1, which would cause the tile coordinates to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` value would be doubled, which would cause the tile coordinates to be off by a factor of 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` value would be halved, which would cause the tile coordinates to be off by a factor of 0.5.

DONE.
