  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `domain` variable, which is an object, while the replacement code fragment is using the number `0`, which is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `domain` variable, which is an object, while the replacement code fragment is using the `null` value, which is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `domain` variable, which is an object, while the replacement code fragment is using the `undefined` value, which is a primitive value.

DONE.
