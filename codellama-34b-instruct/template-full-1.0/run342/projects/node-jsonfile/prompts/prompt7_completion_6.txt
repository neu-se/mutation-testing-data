  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `readFile`, and would return the contents of the file directly, rather than a promise that resolves with the contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `writeFile`, and would write the file contents directly, rather than returning a promise that resolves when the write is complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file)
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFile.bind(null, file)` is a bound version of `readFile`, and would pass the file parameter to the bound function, rather than requiring it as an argument.

DONE.
