  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option is set to `true`, which would cause Cheerio to parse the HTML data as XML, which could result in different parsing behavior than the original code fragment.
