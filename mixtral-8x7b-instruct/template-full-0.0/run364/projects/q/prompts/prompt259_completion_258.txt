 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Q` instance is created, which might have different internal behavior or properties than the original `Q` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the built-in `Promise.resolve` instead of the custom `Q.resolve`, which might have different behavior or implementation details.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly resolves the promise with the value, bypassing any validation or handling of thenables that the original code might have performed.

DONE.
