  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This code fragment is similar to the original `Q(value)`, but it adds a `.then()` method to the promise returned by `Q(value)`. The `.then()` method takes a callback function as its argument, which is called when the promise is resolved. In this case, the callback function simply returns the value that was passed to `Q(value)`, which is the same value that was passed to the `resolve` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value + 1; });
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous option, but it adds 1 to the value that was passed to `Q(value)` before returning it. This change in behavior could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the value to be incremented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value * 2
