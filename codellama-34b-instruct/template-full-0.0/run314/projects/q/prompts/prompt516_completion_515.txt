  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles rejected promises, whereas `then` is a method that handles fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that handles both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas `then` only handles fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that waits for all promises in an array to be fulfilled, whereas `then` only waits for the first promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
