 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.length >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition would allow the `concat` method to include an empty delta when combining with another delta, which could cause unexpected results in subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality without type coercion, while the original `>` operator does coerce types. This could lead to unexpected behavior when concatenating deltas with different types of length properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(other.ops) && other.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `other.ops` is an array before checking its length, providing better protection against cases where `other.ops` might not be an array or might not have a `length` property.
