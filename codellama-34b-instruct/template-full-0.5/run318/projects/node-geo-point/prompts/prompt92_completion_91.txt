  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range of values than the `cos` function, which could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 +
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 +` operator would add 1 to the result of the `cos` function, which could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function returns a random number between 0 and 1, which could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
