  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").join("");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses the `split()` method to split the text into an array of words and the `join()` method to join the words back together without any spaces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/ /g, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses the `replace()` method to replace all spaces in the text with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/\s+/g, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace
