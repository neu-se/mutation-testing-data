  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the condition, so the code would return the timezone object even if it is deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is checking for strict equality, so the code would only return the timezone object if it is deprecated and its `deprecated` property is set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated && tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is checking for both conditions to be true, so the code would only return the timezone object if it is not deprecated and its `deprecated` property is set to `true`.

DONE.
