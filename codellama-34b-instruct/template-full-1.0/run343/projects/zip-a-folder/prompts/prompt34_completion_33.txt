  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with the `close` event instead of the `error` event, which could cause the promise to reject with the wrong error message or data, or lead to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the promise being rejected with a specific error message or data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `null` instead of an error object, which could cause the promise to reject with no error message or data, or lead to unexpected behavior in the code
