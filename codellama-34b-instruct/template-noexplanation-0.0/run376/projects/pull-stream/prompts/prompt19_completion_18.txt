  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `ref[0]`.

DONE.
