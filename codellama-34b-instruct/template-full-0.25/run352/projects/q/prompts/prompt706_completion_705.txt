  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `concat()` creates a new array that contains the elements of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds an element to the end of the array, whereas `concat()` creates a new array that contains the elements of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, whereas `concat()` creates a new array that contains the elements of the original array.

DONE.
