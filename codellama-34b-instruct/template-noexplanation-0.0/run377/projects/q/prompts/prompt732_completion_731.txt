  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise with an empty array, even if there are still pending promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise with an array of promises, even if some of the promises are still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 && promises.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise with an empty array, only if there are no pending promises and the array of promises is empty.

DONE.
