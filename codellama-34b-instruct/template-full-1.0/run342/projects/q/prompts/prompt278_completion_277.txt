  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, while `self.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.notify` is a function that sends a notification to the promise's listeners, while `self.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value, while `self.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise.

DONE.
