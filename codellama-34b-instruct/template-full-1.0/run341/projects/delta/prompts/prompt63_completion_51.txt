  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys` method to be called on the `attributes` object, rather than the `arg` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys` method to be called on the `arg` object, rather than the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys` method to be called on `null`, rather than an object.

DONE.
