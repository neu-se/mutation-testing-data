  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER `<senario input>` can be replaced with:
```
"should throw error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to the `throwError` function is now a string literal, which does not raise an error. The `eval` function would simply return the string instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER `<senario input>` can be replaced with:
```
notFound.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the length of the `notFound` array to 0, which would result in a different stack trace and error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER `<senario input>` can be replaced with:
```
"different-error-message"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message that is caught and returned.

DONE.
