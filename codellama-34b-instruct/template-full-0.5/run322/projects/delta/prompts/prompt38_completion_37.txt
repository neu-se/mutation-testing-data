  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the first argument passed to the `transform` function, and replacing it with `b` would change the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` is a different value than `b`, and it would change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `b`, and it would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
