  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a variable name, while the replacement `"foo"` is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a variable name, while the replacement `id + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of the variable `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a variable name, while the replacement `data.countries[id]` is an expression that retrieves the value of the `id` property of the `data.countries` object.

DONE.
