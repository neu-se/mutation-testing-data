 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor[op].call
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the `op` method is called on the `descriptor` object. The `apply` method allows passing an array of arguments, while the `call` method requires individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor[op].bind(null, op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the `op` method is called on the `descriptor` object by using `bind`. This creates a new function with the `op` property pre-set as the first argument, which might not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor.op()
