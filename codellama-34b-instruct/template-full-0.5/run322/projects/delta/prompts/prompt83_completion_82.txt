  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the `attributes` objects are different, even if the keys and values are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the number of keys in the `attributes` objects is different, even if the keys and values are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.hasOwnProperty('differentKey') !== lastOp.attributes.hasOwnProperty('differentKey')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the `attributes` objects have different keys, even if the keys and values are the same.

DONE.
