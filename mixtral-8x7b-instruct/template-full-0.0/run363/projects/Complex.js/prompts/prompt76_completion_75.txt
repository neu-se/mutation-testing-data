 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i < tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last token in the `tokens` array will not be processed, causing the complex number to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will not execute at all, causing the complex number to be parsed as `{ 're': 0, 'im': 0 }`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i in tokens
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will iterate based on the presence of properties in the `tokens` array, rather than their index, causing unpredictable parsing behavior.

DONE.
