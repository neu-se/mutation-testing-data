  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at index 1 instead of 0, which may cause the loop to skip over the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at index -1, which is an invalid index and will likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Infinity
```
This change will cause the loop to start at index Infinity, which is an invalid index and will likely cause an error.

DONE.
