 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2 * Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is a constant value, while the original code fragment is a function call. This change would cause the `sinh` method to return a complex number with a real part of `sinh(a) * 2` and an imaginary part of `cosh(a) * Math.sin(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number. This change would cause the `sinh` method to return a complex number with a real part of `sinh(a) * Math.abs(b)` and an imaginary part of `cosh(a) * Math.sin(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
