  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that takes an array as an argument and returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array. By calling `array_slice.call(arguments)`, we are passing the `arguments` object as an array to `array_slice`, which would result in a new array containing the elements of `arguments`. This would be different from the original code, which was simply passing `arguments` as a single object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` is a method that returns a new array containing the elements of `arguments`, starting from the specified index (or 0 if no index is specified). This would be different from the original code, which was simply passing `arguments` as a single object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
