 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the last captured group to match if the context property exists, even if the count is exceeded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if the context is provided, even if the captured groups don't match the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the first context property to match if the count is 0, even if the captured group is missing.

DONE.
