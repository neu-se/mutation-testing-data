  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method would not call the `set` method with a callback function, which would cause the `drain` event to not be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method would not call the `set` method with a callback function, which would cause the `drain` event to not be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method would call the `set` method with a callback function that does nothing, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted immediately.

DONE.
