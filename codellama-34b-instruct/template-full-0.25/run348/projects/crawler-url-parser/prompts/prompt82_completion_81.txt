  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `replace()` method, which would remove any characters after the first semicolon in the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split(";")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `split()` method, which would split the `href` attribute into an array of strings using the semicolon as the delimiter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').substring(0, $(this).attr('href').indexOf(";"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `substring()` method, which would extract a portion of the `href` attribute starting from the first character and ending at the index of the first semicolon.
