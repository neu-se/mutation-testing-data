  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method starts at index 2, which would include the second element of the array, rather than starting at index 1, which would include the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method starts at index -1, which would include the last element of the array, rather than starting at index 1, which would include the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the splice method removes and returns the element at index 1, rather than including it in the resulting array.

DONE.
