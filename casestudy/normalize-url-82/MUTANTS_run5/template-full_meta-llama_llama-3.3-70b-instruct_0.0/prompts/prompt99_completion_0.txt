Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.removeTrailingSlash && urlObj.pathname!== '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is true and the pathname is not the root directory, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!options.removeTrailingSlash || urlObj.hash!== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is false or the hash is not empty, which is different from the original condition that checks for the presence of `removeTrailingSlash` or a specific pathname and an empty hash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname === '' && options.removeTrailingSlash
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only remove the trailing slash when the pathname is empty and `removeTrailingSlash` is true, which is a more restrictive condition than the original one.

DONE.
