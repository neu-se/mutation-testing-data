  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called with a different argument, which could change the length of the peeked operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called on a different iterator, which could have a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called on both iterators and the results are added together, which could change the total length of the peeked operations.

DONE.
