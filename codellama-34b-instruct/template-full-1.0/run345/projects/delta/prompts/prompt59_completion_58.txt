  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops[0]` returns the first element of the `ops` array, whereas `ops.ops` would return a nested array of `ops` within the `ops` array. This change would cause the code to access a different part of the data structure, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length` returns the number of elements in the `ops` array, whereas `ops.ops` would return a nested array of `ops` within the `ops` array. This change would cause the code to access a different part of the data structure, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements of `ops` starting from the second element, whereas `ops.ops
