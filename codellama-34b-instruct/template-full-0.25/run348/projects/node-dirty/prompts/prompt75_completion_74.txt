  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'load'` is emitted when the database is loaded, while the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'load'` is emitted when the database is loaded, while the event `'close'` is emitted when the database is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'load'` is emitted when the database is loaded, while the event `'drain'` is emitted when the write stream is drained.

DONE.
