 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function is called with an additional argument, which adds indentation to the output. The original code does not include indentation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
util.inspect(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because `util.inspect` is used instead of `JSON.stringify`, which may produce different output for certain objects, such as functions or circular references.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.toJSON ? obj.toJSON() : obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has a `toJSON` method and uses its result instead of the object itself. This can lead to different output when the object has a custom `toJSON` method.

DONE.
