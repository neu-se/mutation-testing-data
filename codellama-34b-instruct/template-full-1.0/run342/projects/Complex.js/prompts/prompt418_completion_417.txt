  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `isZero` checks if the number is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of the `re` property, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by zero would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
