  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if the pattern does not match the input string, whereas the original code fragment checks for the opposite condition (i.e., the pattern does match the input string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === spec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns the part of the input string that matches the pattern, whereas the original code fragment checks for the opposite condition (i.e., the pattern does not match the input string).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== spec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if the pattern does not match the input string, whereas the original code fragment checks for the opposite condition (i.e., the pattern does match the input string).
