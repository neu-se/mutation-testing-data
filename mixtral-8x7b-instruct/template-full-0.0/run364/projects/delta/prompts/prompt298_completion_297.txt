 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
predicate.call(null, line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the context of the `predicate` function, which might cause unexpected behavior if the function relies on the `this` keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
predicate(line, {}, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is incremented before being passed to the `predicate` function, which might cause issues if the function relies on the correct index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
predicate(line, {}, 'string')
