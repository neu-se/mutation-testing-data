  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot(this['re'], -this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.hypot()` computes the square root of the sum of the squares of its arguments, while `hypot()` uses the Pythagorean theorem to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle. If the arguments are swapped, the result will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot(this['re'], this['im'] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length `x` and `y` is `Math.hypot(x, y)`, not `Math.hypot(x, y + 1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot(this['re'] - this['im'], Math.sqrt(2) * (this['re'] + this['im']))
