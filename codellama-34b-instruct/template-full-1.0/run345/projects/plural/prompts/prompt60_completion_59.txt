  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterias'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment correctly handles the irregular plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment would incorrectly add an extra "s" to the end of the word, resulting in "criterias".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment correctly handles the irregular plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment would incorrectly add an extra "s" to the end of the word, resulting in "criterions".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterio'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment correctly handles the irregular plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment would incorrectly remove the "s" from the end of the word, resulting in "criterio".
