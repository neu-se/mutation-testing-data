  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed from "post" to "get". The "get" method is used to retrieve a property value, whereas the "post" method is used to set a property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"push"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed from "post" to "push". The "push" method is used to add an element to the end of an array, whereas the "post" method is used to set a property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pop"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed from "post" to "pop". The "pop" method is used to remove the last element of an array, whereas the "post" method is used to set a property value.

DONE.
