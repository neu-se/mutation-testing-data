  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` returns a string representing the URL, while `URL.parse` returns an object with the URL's components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a URL object, while `URL.parse` returns an object with the URL's components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of `URL.parse` specifies whether to parse the query string, and passing `false` would result in the query string not being parsed.

DONE.
