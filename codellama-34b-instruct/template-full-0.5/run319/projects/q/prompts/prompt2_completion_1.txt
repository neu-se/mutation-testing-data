  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise" = function () {
    throw new Error("Test mutation");
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would attempt to call the `promise` function, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise" = function () {
    return "Test mutation";
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would attempt to call the `promise` function, which would return a string instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise" = function () {
    return Promise.reject("Test mutation");
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would attempt to call the `promise` function, which would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

DONE.
