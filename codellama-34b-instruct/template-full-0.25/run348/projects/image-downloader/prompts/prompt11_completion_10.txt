  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension of a path, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(path.dirname(pathname), path.basename(pathname))
```
This would result in different behavior because it joins the directory name and file name of a path, whereas `path.basename` returns just the file name.

DONE.
