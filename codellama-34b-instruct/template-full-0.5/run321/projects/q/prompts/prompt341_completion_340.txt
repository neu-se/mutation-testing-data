  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a promise that resolves to the value of `defer.promise`, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that resolves to the value of `defer.promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise returned by `defer`, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that resolves to the value of `defer.promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` is a function that rejects the promise returned by `defer`, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that resolves to the value of `defer.promise`.

DONE
