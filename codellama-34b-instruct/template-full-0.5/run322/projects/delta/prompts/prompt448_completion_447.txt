  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, whereas the original code would return the value of `op.delete` if it exists, or `undefined` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, whereas the original code would return the value of `op.retain` if it exists, or `undefined` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, whereas the original code would return the value of `op.insert` if it exists, or `undefined` otherwise.

DONE.
