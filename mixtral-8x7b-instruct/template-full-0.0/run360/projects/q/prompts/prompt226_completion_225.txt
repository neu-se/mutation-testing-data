 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object using the `[].slice.call` method, which might not have the same content as the original `arguments` object in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object using the `Array.prototype.slice.call` method, which might not have the same content as the original `arguments` object in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array-like object from the arguments object using the spread operator, which might not have the same content as the original `arguments` object in all cases.

Note: These changes might not cause the tests to fail, but they would result
