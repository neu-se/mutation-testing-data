  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, other.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the other delta, instead of the base op, which could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, new AttributeMap()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the op to an empty attribute map, which could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the other delta to the attributes of the base op, which could lead to false positives or false negatives in the test suite.

DONE.
