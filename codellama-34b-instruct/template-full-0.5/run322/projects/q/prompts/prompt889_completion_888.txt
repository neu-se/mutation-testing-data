  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments and start the slice from the third argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first two arguments and ignore the rest, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the second argument and ignore the rest, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
