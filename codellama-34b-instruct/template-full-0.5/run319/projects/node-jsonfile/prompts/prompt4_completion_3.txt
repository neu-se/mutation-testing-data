  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options` object, which may have properties that are used to configure the `readFile` function. By replacing it with `null`, the function would receive a `null` value instead, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options` object, which may have properties that are used to configure the `readFile` function. By replacing it with an empty object, the function would receive an empty object instead, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding = 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options` object to specify the encoding of the file, but the mutated code fragment sets the encoding to a fixed value of `'utf8'`. This may cause the function to behave differently if
