  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called instead of the `cb` function, which may have unintended consequences in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a `null` argument, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with an `undefined` argument, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
