  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "external")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype()` function would be called with an extra argument, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype("http://www.example.com/", pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype()` function would be called with a different set of arguments, resulting in a different URL being checked for the link's type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype()` function would be called with a different set of arguments, resulting in a different URL being checked for the link's type.

DONE.
