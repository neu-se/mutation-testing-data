 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of Math.cos, which can significantly change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.exp calculates the base of the natural logarithm (e) raised to the power of the input, which is not the same as the original Math.cos function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.random generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), which is not the same as the original Math.cos function.

DONE.
