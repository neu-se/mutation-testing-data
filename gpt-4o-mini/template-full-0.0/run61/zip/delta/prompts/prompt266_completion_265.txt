Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly delete one additional character than intended, potentially leading to data loss in the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively delete nothing, ignoring the actual length of the operation and potentially causing inconsistencies in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete twice the length of the operation, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or unintended deletion of adjacent operations.

DONE.
