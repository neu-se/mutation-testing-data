 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'x' instead of 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'S' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the entire word to uppercase and appends 'S' instead of just appending 's' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 1 }
