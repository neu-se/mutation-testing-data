  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `cb(null, null)` is a function call that passes two `null` arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `cb(undefined, undefined)` is a function call that passes two `undefined` arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `cb(null)` is a function call that passes only one argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
