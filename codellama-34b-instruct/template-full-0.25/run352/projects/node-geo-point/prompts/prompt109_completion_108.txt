  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` level would be increased by 1, which would cause the tile coordinates to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` level would be decreased by 1, which would cause the tile coordinates to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` level would be doubled, which would cause the tile coordinates to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
