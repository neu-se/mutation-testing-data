  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used to remove an element from the `urlMap` object, but the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to add an element to the `urlMap` object, but the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method is used to remove all elements from the `urlMap` object, but the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
