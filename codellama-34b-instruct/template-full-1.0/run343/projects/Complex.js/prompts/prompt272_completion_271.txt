  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
 This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, causing the `abs` function to return 0 for any input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, causing the `abs` function to always return a positive value for any input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1, causing the `abs` function to always return a negative value for any input.

DONE.
