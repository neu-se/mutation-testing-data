  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `y * (x + 1)`, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator has a higher precedence than the multiplication operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(y + 1) * x`, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - x
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator has a higher precedence than the multiplication operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(y - 1) * x`, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
