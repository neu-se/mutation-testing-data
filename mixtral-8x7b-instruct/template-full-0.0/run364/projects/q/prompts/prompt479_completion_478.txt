 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the specific rejected promise from the unhandledRejections array, but does not remove the corresponding unhandledReason, causing a mismatch between the two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.length
