  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "man" or "woman", while the modified code fragment matches words that end with "man" or "wo" followed by "man".
