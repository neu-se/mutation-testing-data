  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the real part of the complex number by the number of places, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
