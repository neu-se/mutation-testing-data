  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because this rule would return the word "os" instead of "oes" for words ending in "o" and not "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because this rule would return the word "oes" instead of "os" for words ending in "o" and not "y".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'eees' })
```
This would result in different behavior because this rule would return the word "eees" instead of "oes" for words ending in "o" and not "y".
