  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the `key` property to an empty array, while this replacement sets the value to an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the `key` property to an empty array, while this replacement sets the value to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the `key` property to an empty array, while this replacement sets the value to `null`.

DONE.
