  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.values` returns an array of the property values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of property names, while `Object.entries` returns an array of property name/value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.fromEntries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.fromEntries` is the inverse of `Object.entries`, and it constructs a new object from an array of property name/value pairs.

Note: These suggested replacements are not intended to be used in production code, but rather as examples to demonstrate different ways of mutating the original code.
