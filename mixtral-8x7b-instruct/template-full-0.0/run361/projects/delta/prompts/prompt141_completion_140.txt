 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing incorrect index calculations and unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the length, causing all operations to be processed, potentially leading to incorrect composition or slicing of the delta operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `length` property on the actual operation object instead of the `peekLength` method, potentially causing errors if the operation object does not have a `length` property or if the `peek` method returns `undefined`.

DONE.
