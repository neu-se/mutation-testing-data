  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is defined in the `Promise` prototype, but it has a different signature than the `post` method, so it would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is defined in the `Promise` prototype, but it has a different signature than the `post` method, so it would not work as intended.

DONE.
