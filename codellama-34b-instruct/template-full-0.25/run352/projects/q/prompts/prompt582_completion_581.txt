  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `errback` function to be called with the `continuer` function as its `this` context, rather than the `generator` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(generator, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `errback` function to be called with the `generator` function as its `this` context, rather than the `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `errback` function to be called with the `continuer` function as its `this` context, rather than the `generator` function.

DONE.
