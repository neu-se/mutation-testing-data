  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is an object, so attempting to access its first element would throw an error instead of always returning `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is an object, and its `message` property may not be truthy, causing the check to return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is an object that is not necessarily an instance of `Error`, so the check would not return `true` every time.

DONE.
