  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, while the new code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is finite and `a['arg']` is finite. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially lead to errors in the program.

DONE.
