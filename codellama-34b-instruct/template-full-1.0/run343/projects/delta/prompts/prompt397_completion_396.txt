  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `push`, and would likely cause errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(<>rand())
```
This would result in different behavior because `rand()` is a random number generator and would cause the `retain` method to retain a different amount of length than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(<someVariable>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain a value based on the value of `someVariable`, which could be different than the value of `length` in the original code.

DONE.
