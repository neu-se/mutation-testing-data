 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` uses the provided `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` uses the provided `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled(array[0])
