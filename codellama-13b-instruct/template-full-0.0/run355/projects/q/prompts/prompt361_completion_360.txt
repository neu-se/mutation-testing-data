  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would resolve the promise with a fulfilled value, while `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with a rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would resolve the promise with a fulfilled value, while `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would resolve the promise with a fulfilled value, while `deferred.promiseDispatch` would dispatch a promise operation to the promise.

DONE.
