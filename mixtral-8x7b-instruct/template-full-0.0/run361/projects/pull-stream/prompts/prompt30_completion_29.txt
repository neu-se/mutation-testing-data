 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the fourth argument instead of the third one, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or accessing an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `ref` array instead of accessing the third element, potentially changing the behavior of the function and causing unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the loop variable `i` instead of the fixed index `2`, potentially causing it to access different elements in the `ref` array depending on the length of the arguments. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
