  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Option 1
(<TYPE>op.retain ?? false) && op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is behaving differently than the original code. In the original code, the `&&` operator would return `op.attributes` if `op.retain` is truthy, or `false` if `op.retain` is falsy. However, in the new code, if `op.retain` is falsy, the expression would return `false` instead of `op.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Option 2
!op.retain && op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is behaving differently than the original code. In the original code, the `!` operator would return the negation of `op.retain`, which would always evaluate to a boolean value. However, in the new code, if `op.retain` is falsy, the expression
