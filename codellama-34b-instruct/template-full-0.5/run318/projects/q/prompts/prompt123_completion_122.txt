  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key if object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` keyword would cause the code to enter a new block, potentially changing the behavior of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key or object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `or` keyword would cause the code to evaluate both sides of the expression, potentially changing the behavior of the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key && object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` keyword would cause the code to evaluate both sides of the expression, potentially changing the behavior of the loop.

DONE.
