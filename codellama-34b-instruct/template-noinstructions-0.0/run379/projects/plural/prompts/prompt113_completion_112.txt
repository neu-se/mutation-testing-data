  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(tools)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array, so the `clothes` array would be modified and would no longer be the same as the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.push(tools)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method modifies the original array by adding new elements to it, so the `clothes` array would be modified and would no longer be the same as the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.splice(0, 0, tools)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method modifies the original array by adding new elements to it, so the `clothes` array would be modified and would no longer be the same as the original array.

DONE.
