  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is used in the `eachLine` function as the index of the current line, but by replacing it with `0`, the function would always return the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is used in the `eachLine` function as the index of the current line, and `i + 1` would cause the function to skip the first line and return the second line instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is used in the `eachLine` function as the index of the current line, and `i * 2` would cause the function to return every other line.

DONE.
