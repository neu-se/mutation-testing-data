  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value `null` instead of the policy object with the specified name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the lowercase version of the policy name, which may not be the same as the actual policy name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "xyz"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the string "xyz" to the end of the policy name, which may not be the same as the actual policy name.

DONE.
