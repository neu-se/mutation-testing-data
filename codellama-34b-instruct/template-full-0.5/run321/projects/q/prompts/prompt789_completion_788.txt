  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different error message if it is not fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(onUnhandledError, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the original error message if it is not fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would not be rejected if it is not fulfilled before the timeout.

DONE.
