 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both numbers being infinite instead of at least one being infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite() || z.isFinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is infinite or the input complex number is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this['isFinite']() || !z['isFinite']()
