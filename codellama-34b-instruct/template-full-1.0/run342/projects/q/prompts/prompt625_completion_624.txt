  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking that `object` was not undefined, and now it would always be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking that `object` was not undefined, and now it would always be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking that `object` was not undefined, and now it would always be null.

DONE.
