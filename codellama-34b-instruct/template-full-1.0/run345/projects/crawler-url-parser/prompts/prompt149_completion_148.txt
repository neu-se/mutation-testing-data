  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_path` variable is being used instead of the `pageurl_path` variable, which would cause the function to operate on the wrong input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let pageurl_parts = linkurl_path.split("/").filter(function(elem,index,array){return elem.length>0});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_path` variable is being used instead of the `pageurl_path` variable, which would cause the function to operate on the wrong input. Additionally, the `filter` function is being used with a different function as its argument, which could cause the resulting array to have different elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let pageurl_parts = pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]+)$/, "").split("/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the
