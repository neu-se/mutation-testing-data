  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `calculateDistance` method would return `undefined` instead of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.longitude` is a different value than `this`, so the `calculateDistance` method would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, so the `calculateDistance` method would return a random distance instead of a fixed distance.

DONE.
