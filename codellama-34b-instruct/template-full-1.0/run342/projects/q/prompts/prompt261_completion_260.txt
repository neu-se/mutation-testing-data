  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the `if` statement, making the code in the `else` block unreachable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for the `if` statement, making the code in the `if` block unreachable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for the `if` statement, making the code in the `if` block unreachable.

DONE.
