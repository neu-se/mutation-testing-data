  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is rejected, it would return `null` instead of `rejected`, which could cause issues for the code that handles the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is rejected, it would return `undefined` instead of `rejected`, which could cause issues for the code that handles the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is rejected, it would return the `promise` object itself instead of `rejected`, which could cause issues for the code that handles the promise.

DONE.
