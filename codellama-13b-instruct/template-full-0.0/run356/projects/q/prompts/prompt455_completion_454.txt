  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is being used as a boolean value, and the `!` operator is being used to negate it. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called even when the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true`, which would result in the `unhandledRejections` array being modified even when the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is being used as a boolean value, and the `!` operator is being used to negate it. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called even when the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `false`, which would result in the `unhandledRejections` array being modified even when
