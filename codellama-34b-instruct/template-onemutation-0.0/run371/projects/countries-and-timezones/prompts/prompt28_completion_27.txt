  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer. This change would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return different values for the `utcOffsetStr` and `dstOffsetStr` properties of the `result` object, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses these values.

DONE.
