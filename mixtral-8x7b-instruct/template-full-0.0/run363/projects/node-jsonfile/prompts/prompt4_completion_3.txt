 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the encoding, which may cause issues if the input file is not text or uses a different encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.encoding || 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a default encoding to 'utf8', which may not match the desired encoding for certain files, causing issues when reading or writing files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes null as the encoding, which may cause issues if the input file is not text or uses a different encoding.

These changes introduce different behavior compared to the original code fragment, which allows for more comprehensive testing of the code. DONE.
