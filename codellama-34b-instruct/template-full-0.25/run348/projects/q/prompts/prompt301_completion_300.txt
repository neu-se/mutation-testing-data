  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `this` to the array, which could cause the `join` method to fail if it expects only two elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the `join` method to fail if it relies on the order of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace `that` with `null`, which could cause the `join` method to fail if it expects a non-null value.

DONE.
