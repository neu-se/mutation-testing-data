  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a string, while `options` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a function, while `options` is an object.

DONE.
