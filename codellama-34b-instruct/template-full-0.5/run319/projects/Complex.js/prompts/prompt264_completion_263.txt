  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the argument passed to the `atan2` function, which is used to calculate the angle of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the argument passed to the `cos` function, which is used to calculate the cosine of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the argument passed to the `sin` function, which is used to calculate the sine of the complex number.

DONE.
