  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` is the negation of `done`, so the code inside the `if` block would be executed when the promise is not done, rather than when it is done.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `done === false` is equivalent to `!done`, so the code inside the `if` block would be executed when the promise is not done, rather than when it is done.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `done !== true` is equivalent to `!done`, so the code inside the `if` block would be executed when the promise is not done, rather than when it is done.

DONE.
