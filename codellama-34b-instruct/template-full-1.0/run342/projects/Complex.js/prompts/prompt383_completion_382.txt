  Sure thing! Here are three different options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos()` function returns the cosine of the input value, rather than the sine. This could cause the complex number to be incorrectly transformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan()` function returns the tangent of the input value, which is not the same as the sine or cosine. This could cause the complex number to be incorrectly transformed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
Math.sin + Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` functions are being added together, which would cause the complex number to be transformed in a way that is not intended.

DONE.
