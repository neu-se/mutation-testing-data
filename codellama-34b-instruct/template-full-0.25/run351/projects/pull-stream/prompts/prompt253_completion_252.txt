  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream, while `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk of data from the current stream. Using `nextStream` instead of `nextChunk` would cause the code to read the next stream instead of the next chunk of data, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` is a function that reads the next chunk of data from the current stream, while `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream. Using `nextChunk()` instead of `nextStream` would cause the code to read the next chunk of data instead of the next stream, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true
