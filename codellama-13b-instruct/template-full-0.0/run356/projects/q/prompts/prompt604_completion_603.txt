  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    self.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called asynchronously, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    self.promiseDispatch(deferred.reject, op, args);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called asynchronously, which could lead to unexpected results.
