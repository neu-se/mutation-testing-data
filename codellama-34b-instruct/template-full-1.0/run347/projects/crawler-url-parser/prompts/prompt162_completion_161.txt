  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, whereas the `==` operator checks for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, whereas the `==` operator checks for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length - pageurl_parts.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used to subtract the length of the `pageurl_parts` array from the length of the `linkurl_parts` array, and then comparing the result to 1.

DONE.
