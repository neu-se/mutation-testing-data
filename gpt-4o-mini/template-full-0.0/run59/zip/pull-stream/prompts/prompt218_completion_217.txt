Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the error instead of the actual error `err`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the error in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `err` as the first argument but `null` as the second argument, which would mean that the callback is invoked without a valid callback function, likely causing a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would switch the order of the arguments, passing the callback as the first argument and the error as the second, which is not the expected signature for the callback and could lead to unexpected results or errors in the handling of the callback.

DONE.
