  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is never called, so the promise state would not be checked, and the function would always return `object` instead of the expected resulting value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is only called on promises, and would result in an error if `object` is not a promise. Additionally, the `then` method would not return the expected resulting value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called with the wrong `this` context, causing an error. Additionally, the `inspect` method would not return the expected resulting value.

DONE.
