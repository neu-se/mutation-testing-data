Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code of the response would be incremented by 1, potentially changing the HTTP status code sent to the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.statusCode` is used instead of `this.statusCode`, which could lead to different behavior if `res` and `this` are not the same object in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
200
```
This would result in different behavior because a fixed status code of 200 (OK) would always be used, regardless of the actual status code of the response, potentially hiding errors or other status codes.

DONE.
