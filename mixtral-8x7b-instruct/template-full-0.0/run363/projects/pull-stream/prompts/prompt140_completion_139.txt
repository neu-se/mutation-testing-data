 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be wrapped in an arrow function, potentially changing its context and affecting how `cb` is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because a no-op function would be used as the default value for `cb`, potentially causing the original code's intended behavior to be suppressed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` would be invoked with the result of `generate()` instead of being used as the callback function, which could cause unexpected behavior in the original code.

DONE.
