  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the loop would iterate over the verbs in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, so the loop would iterate over all but the first element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.filter(v => v.startsWith('d'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, so the loop would iterate over only the verbs that start with the letter 'd'.

DONE.
