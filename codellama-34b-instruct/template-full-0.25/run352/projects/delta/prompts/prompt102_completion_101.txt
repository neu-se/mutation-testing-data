  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is used to remove the last element of an array, but the `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid argument for the `pop` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is used to remove the last element of an array, but the `this.ops.length - 1` argument is not a valid index for the `pop` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is used to remove the last element of an array, but the `this.ops.length` argument is not a valid index for the `pop` method.
