  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.async` function returns a function, but the original code calls that function immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.async` function returns a function, but the original code calls that function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.async` function returns a function, but the original code calls that function immediately.

DONE.
