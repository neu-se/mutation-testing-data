  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because calling 'createWriteStream' on the target directory would create a new file with a null name, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because calling 'createWriteStream' with the 'a' flag would append to the target file instead of overwriting it, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(path.join(path.dirname(targetFilePath), 'backup.tar'))
```
This would result in different behavior because calling 'createWriteStream' with a different path would create a new file named 'backup.tar' in the target directory instead of overwriting the existing target file.

DONE.
