  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which would result in an empty string being returned, while the new code fragment would return a string with a single space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which would result in an empty string being returned, while the new code fragment would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which would result in an empty string being returned, while the new code fragment would return `undefined`.

DONE.
