  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with a different argument, potentially returning a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with a different argument, potentially returning a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id].name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with a different argument, potentially returning a different result.

DONE.
