  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `reducer` function to receive `null` as the second argument, which may cause it to produce unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `reducer` function to receive `undefined` as the second argument, which may also cause it to produce unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the `reducer` function to receive `0` as the second argument, which may cause it to produce incorrect results or errors.

DONE.
