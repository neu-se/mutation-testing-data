  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object instead of modifying the existing one, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the original object being modified in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[id] = getCountry(id, options);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the result of `getCountry()` directly to the `prev` object, instead of creating a new object with the result. This could cause issues if other parts of the code rely on the new object being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev = Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object and assign it to the `prev` variable, instead of modifying the existing object in place. This could cause
