  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `inspect` is not a function, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to always throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `inspect` is a function, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to never throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `inspect` is not a function, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to always throw an error.

DONE.
