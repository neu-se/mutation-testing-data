  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern would not match the word "man" anymore, and the replacement function would replace the letter "a" with "e", which would result in the word "women" being returned instead of "woman".
