  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function than `clearTimeout`, and it would not clear the timeout set by the `setTimeout` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that sets a new timeout, rather than clearing an existing one. It would create a new timeout that would not be cleared by the `clearTimeout` function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, rather than clearing a timeout. It would log a message to the console every time the `timeoutId` variable was referenced, which would not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
