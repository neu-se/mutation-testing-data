  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a variable that is set to `true` when the `sink.abort()` method is called. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, and the `read()` method would not be called with the `abort` argument set to `true`. This could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
