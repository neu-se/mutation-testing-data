  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the `src` variable is a glob, the `!isGlob(src)` expression would evaluate to `false`, and if the `src` variable is not a glob, the expression would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && src.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator requires both expressions to be true, so if the `src` variable is a glob and has a length greater than 0, the expression would evaluate to `true`, otherwise it would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || src.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator requires either expression to be true, so if the `
