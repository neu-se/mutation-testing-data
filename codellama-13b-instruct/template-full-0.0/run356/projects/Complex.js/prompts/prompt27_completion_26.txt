  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable `Invalid Param` is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a string concatenation of a string literal and a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable `Invalid Param` is defined or not, and if the number `1` is defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a string concatenation of a string literal and a string literal. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable `Invalid Param` is
