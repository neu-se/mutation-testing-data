  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort || null` is a nullable boolean value. If `abort` is true, the original code fragment would return `abort`, while `abort || null` would return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `!abort` is the negation of `abort`. If `abort` is true, the original code fragment would return `abort`, while `!abort` would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort && null` is a nullable boolean value. If `abort` is true, the
