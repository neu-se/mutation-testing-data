  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().type
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` only returns the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation, while `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation.

DONE.
