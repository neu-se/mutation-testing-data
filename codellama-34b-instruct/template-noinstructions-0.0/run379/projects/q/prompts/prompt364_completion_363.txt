  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the fulfillment value of the promise, while `undefined` would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the fulfillment value of the promise, while `null` would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the fulfillment value of the promise, while `throw new Error("test")` would throw an error.

DONE.
