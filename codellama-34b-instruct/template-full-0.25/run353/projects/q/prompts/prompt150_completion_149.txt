  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stackCounter
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stackCounter` is a different property than `p.stack`, and it may not be defined for all promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.source.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source.stack` is a different property than `p.stack`, and it may not be defined for all promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stack.length` is a different property than `p.stack`, and it may not be defined for all promises.

DONE.
