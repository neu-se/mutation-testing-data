  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `nextStream` would only be called when the `end` argument is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback passed to `_read` would be called with the `err` and `data` arguments, whereas the original code fragment would only call the callback with the `err` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err
