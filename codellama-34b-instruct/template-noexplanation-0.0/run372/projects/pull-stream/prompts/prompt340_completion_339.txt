  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key
```
This change will cause the `field` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the `filter` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.value
```
This change will cause the `field` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the `filter` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key + data.value
```
This change will cause the `field` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the `filter` function to behave differently.

DONE.
