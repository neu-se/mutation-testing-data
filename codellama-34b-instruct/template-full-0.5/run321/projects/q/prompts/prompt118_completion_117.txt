  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` parameter is used as the `this` value for the callback function, and passing `undefined` would cause the callback to be called with a different `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` parameter is used as the `this` value for the callback function, and passing `null` would cause the callback to be called with a different `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` parameter is used as the `this` value for the callback function, and passing an object would cause the callback to be called with a different `this` value.

DONE.
