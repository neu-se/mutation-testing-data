  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method removes all entries from the map, whereas the original code only removes a single entry using the `delete` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method adds a new entry to the map with a value of `null`, whereas the original code only removes an entry if it exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var tmp = urlMap.get(baseUrlStr);
delete tmp;
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, tmp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the three lines of code first retrieve the value associated with the `baseUrlStr` key, then delete that value, and finally set the value back to the original value using the `set` method. This would have no effect on the original code, but could result in different behavior in
