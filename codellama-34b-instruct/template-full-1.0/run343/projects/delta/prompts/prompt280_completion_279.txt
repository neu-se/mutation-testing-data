  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the null object being passed to the `diff` function, which would likely cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `retain` property of `thisOp` being passed to the `diff` function, which would likely cause the function to produce different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = other.retain(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `retain` method of `other` being called with a parameter, which would likely cause the method to produce different output.

DONE.
