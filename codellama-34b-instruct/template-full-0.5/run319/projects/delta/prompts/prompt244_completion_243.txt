  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next `length - opLength` operations in the iterator, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next `length - opLength` operations in the other iterator, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only skip over the next `opLength` operations in the other iterator, potentially missing a necessary operation.

DONE.
