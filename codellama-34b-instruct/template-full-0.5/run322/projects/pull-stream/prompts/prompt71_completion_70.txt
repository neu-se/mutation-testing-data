  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `op` could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `op` by 2 could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

DONE.
