  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, which would cause the promise chain to short-circuit and not execute the subsequent `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would return a promise that resolves to `null`, which would cause the promise chain to short-circuit and not execute the subsequent `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would return a promise that resolves to the original value, which would cause the promise chain to continue executing the subsequent `then` method.

DONE.
