  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.on('close', resolve)` would be called instead of `output.on('error', reject)`, which means that the promise would be resolved instead of rejected when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Some error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject(new Error('Some error message'))` would be called instead of `reject`, which means that the promise would be rejected with a specific error message instead of just being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Some error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(new Error('Some error message'))` would be called instead of `resolve`, which means that the promise would be resolved with a specific error message instead of just being resolved.

DONE.
