  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return 0, even if the input value is not Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return -1, even if the input value is not Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return Infinity, even if the input value is not Infinity.

DONE.
