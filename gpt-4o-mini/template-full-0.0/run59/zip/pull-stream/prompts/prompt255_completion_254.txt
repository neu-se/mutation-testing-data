Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Stream not available'))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of attempting to read the next stream, it immediately calls the callback with an error, which would prevent any further processing of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would recursively call `nextStream` instead of initializing the stream, potentially leading to a stack overflow if there are no streams to process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function directly with `null` and the callback, bypassing the logic to handle the next stream, which could lead to incorrect handling of the stream's data.

DONE.
