  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two elements in the iterator, potentially causing the loop to miss important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator back to the previous element, potentially causing the loop to repeat operations or miss important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the loop to repeat operations or miss important operations.

DONE.
