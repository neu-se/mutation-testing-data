  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression would be evaluated as `NaN` when `b` is `NaN`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `NaN` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b - 1` expression would be evaluated as `NaN` when `b` is `NaN`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `NaN` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * 2` expression would be evaluated as `NaN` when `b` is `NaN`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `NaN` in that case.

DONE.
