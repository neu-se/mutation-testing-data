  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "person" as "people", while this new code fragment adds it as "peoples".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'persons')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "person" as "people", while this new code fragment adds it as "persons".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'humans')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "person" as "people", while this new code fragment adds it as "humans".

DONE.
