  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` is a method that advances the iterator to the next element, but it does not return a value, so the expression `thisIter.next` would evaluate to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` takes an optional argument that specifies the number of elements to advance the iterator. Passing `1` as an argument would advance the iterator by one element, which would cause the loop to skip over the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.length` returns the number of elements in the array, so passing it as an argument to `thisIter.next` would advance the iterator to the end of the array.

DONE.
