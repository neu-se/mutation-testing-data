  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with a `null` argument, which is not the same as calling it with the original `end` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with the number `1` as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with the original `end` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with the value `undefined` as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with the original `end` argument.

DONE.
