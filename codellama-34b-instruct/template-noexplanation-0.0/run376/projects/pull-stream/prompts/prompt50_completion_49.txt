  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, which will result in the `else if` block being executed. This will cause the function to return `s.source` instead of `read`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, which will result in the `else if` block being executed. This will cause the function to return `s.source` instead of `read`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.prototype.constructor === Function
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, which will result in the `else if` block being executed. This will cause the function to return `s.source` instead of `read`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the calling code
