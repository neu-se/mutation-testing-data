  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. This could cause the `invert` function to produce different results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `attr[key]` is undefined, while this new code fragment also checks if it is null. This could cause the `invert` function to produce different results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined && attr[key] !== null && attr[key] !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks
