  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array, while the new code fragment returns an array with three elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array with three elements, while the new code fragment returns an array with four elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array with three elements, while the new code fragment returns an array with five elements.

DONE.
