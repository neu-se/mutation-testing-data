  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the domain of the host, rather than the domain of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the subdomain of the host, rather than the subdomain of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).tld
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the top-level domain (TLD) of the host, rather than the TLD of the URL.

DONE.
