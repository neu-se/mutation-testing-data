  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` is a boolean inverse of `end`, so it would cause the `if` statement to be executed even if `end` is not true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && false` is a logical AND operation that always evaluates to `false`, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || true` is a logical OR operation that always evaluates to `true`, so the `if` statement would always be executed.

DONE.
