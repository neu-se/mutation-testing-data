  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(!read || typeof read.source !== 'function')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making the check for `read.source` fail when it would have succeeded in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(read && typeof read.source === 'object')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `read.source` is an object, rather than a function, which would cause the check to fail when it would have succeeded in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(read && typeof read.source === 'function' && read.source.length === 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check the length of `read.source` to be equal to 1, which would cause the check to fail when it would have succeeded in the original code.

DONE.
