  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the program to crash, whereas the original code fragment would continue executing the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return from the function without executing the rest of the code, whereas the original code fragment would continue executing the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, whereas the original code fragment would return the result of the `flush` function.

DONE.
