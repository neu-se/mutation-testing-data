  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.direct
``` 
This would result in different behavior because Q.direct is defined as a Proxy that forwards the dispatch message to the original value, and Q.nextTick() is used to delay the execution of the operation until the next event loop iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.root
``` 
This would result in different behavior because Q.root is defined as a Proxy that forwards the dispatch message to the root value, which is the value that was initially wrapped by the Proxy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.meta
``` 
This would result in different behavior because Q.meta is defined as a Proxy that forwards the dispatch message to the meta value, which is the value that contains the metadata for the original value being wrapped by the Proxy.

DONE.
