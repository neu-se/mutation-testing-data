  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with a non-zero status code, indicating an error, whereas the original code would simply exit with a zero status code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with the string "error" as the status code, whereas the original code would simply exit with a zero status code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error("error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with an Error object as the status code, whereas the original code would simply exit with a zero status code.

DONE.
