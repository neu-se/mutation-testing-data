  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mimos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned plural form would be incorrect for the given singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned plural form would be incorrect for the given singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, since the returned plural form would be correct for the given singular form.

DONE.
