  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire `other` Delta onto the end of `delta`, rather than just the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first element of `other` onto the end of `delta`, rather than the entire `other` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(other);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate `other` onto the end of `delta`, rather than just pushing the first element of `other` onto `delta`.

DONE.
