  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (laterQueue.length > 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is only called if `laterQueue` is non-empty, whereas the original code calls `flush()` regardless of the length of `laterQueue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (flushing === false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is set to `true` when the function is called, and this change would cause `flushing` to be set to `false` even if the function is called again later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = requestPortTick;
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is set to a function that posts a message to the message channel, whereas the original code sets `requestTick` to a function that calls `setTimeout` with the `flush` function as its argument.

DONE.
