  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber[0]` would be `undefined` if the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function returned `undefined`, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` even if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable was not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber[1]` would be `undefined` if the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function returned `undefined`, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` even if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable was not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber[0]` would be `null` if the `getFileNameAndLine
