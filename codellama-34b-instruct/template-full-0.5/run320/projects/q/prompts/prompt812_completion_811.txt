  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments, but in this case, it would be invoked with the argument `1`, which would cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments, but in this case, it would be invoked with the argument `null`, which would cause it to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments, but in this case, it would be invoked with the argument `undefined`, which would cause it to fail.

DONE.
