  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it subtracts 1 instead of adding it, which could potentially cause a different result in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the variable `b` instead of 1, which could potentially cause a different result in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 1
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it multiplies `a` and `b` instead of squaring `a` and adding 1. This could potentially cause a different result in the calculation.

DONE.
