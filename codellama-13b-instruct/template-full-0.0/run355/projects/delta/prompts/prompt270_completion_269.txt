  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `other` delta to be applied to the `this` delta, rather than the other way around.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `this` delta to be applied to the `other` delta, rather than the other way around.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `other` delta to be applied to the `this` delta, but only for the first operation in the `other` delta, rather than all of them.

DONE.
