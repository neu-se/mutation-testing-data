  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number and will never be equal to the string `'string'`. The `if` statement will always evaluate to `false`, and the `length` variable will never be assigned a value.
```
DONE.
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number and will always be greater than 0 if it is non-zero. The `if` statement will always evaluate to `true`, and the `length` variable will always be assigned a non-zero value.
```
DONE.
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number and will always be less than 0 if it is negative. The `if
