Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.emit` function to not receive the promise object, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the unhandled rejection event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the promise object would mean that the event emitted does not reference the original promise, which could lead to confusion or errors in tracking which promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` would refer to the context of the function where `trackRejection` is called, which may not be the promise object itself, leading to incorrect event emission and tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
