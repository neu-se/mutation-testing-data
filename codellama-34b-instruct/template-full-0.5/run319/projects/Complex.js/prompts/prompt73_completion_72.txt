  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to the next iteration of the loop, while the replaced code would exit the loop immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to the next iteration of the loop, while the replaced code would exit the loop immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to the next iteration of the loop, while the replaced code would exit the loop immediately.

DONE.
