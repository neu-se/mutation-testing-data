  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` is a number, and `array` is an array, so the `map` function would not be able to iterate over the array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array[i]` is a single element of the array, and `map` function would not be able to iterate over the array elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice(i)` returns a new array containing the elements from index `i` to the end of the array, and `map` function would not be able to iterate over the array elements.

DONE.
