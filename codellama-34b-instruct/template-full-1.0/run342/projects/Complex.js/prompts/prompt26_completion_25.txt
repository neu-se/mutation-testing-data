  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 'Invalid Param';
```
This would result in a different error message being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in a different error message being thrown, with a different error type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in a different error message being thrown, with a different error type and a more general error message.

DONE.
