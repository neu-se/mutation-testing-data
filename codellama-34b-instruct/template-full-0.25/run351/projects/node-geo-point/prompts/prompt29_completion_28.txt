  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are swapped, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 180 - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is replaced with a random value between -90 and 90 degrees, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
