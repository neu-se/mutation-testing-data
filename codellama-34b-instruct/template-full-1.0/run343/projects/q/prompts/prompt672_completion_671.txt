  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.reject()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise immediately, whereas the original code `Q` would forward the promise to the next step in the chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.isPending()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.isPending()` would return a boolean value indicating whether the promise is pending or not, whereas the original code `Q` would forward the promise to the next step in the chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.when()`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` would resolve the promise immediately, whereas the original code `Q` would forward the promise to the next step in the chain.

DONE.
