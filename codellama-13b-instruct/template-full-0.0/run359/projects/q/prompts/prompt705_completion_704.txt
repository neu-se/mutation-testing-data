  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` returns an array of all the arguments passed to the function, while `arguments[0]` returns the first argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `void 0` returns `undefined`, while `void 0` returns `undefined` and also evaluates to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` returns the value of the `this` keyword, while `this` returns the value of the `this` keyword and also evaluates to the value of the `this` keyword.

DONE.
