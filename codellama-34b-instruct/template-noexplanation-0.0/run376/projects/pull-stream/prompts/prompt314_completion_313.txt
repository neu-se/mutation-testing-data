  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` instead of `data`, which may cause issues if the function is expected to return a specific type of data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `data`, which may cause issues if the function is expected to return a specific type of data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This change will cause the function to return the string "hello" instead of `data`, which may cause issues if the function is expected to return a specific type of data.

DONE.
