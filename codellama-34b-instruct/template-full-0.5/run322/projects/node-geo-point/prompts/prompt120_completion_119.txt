  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, distance, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to use the longitude of the current `GeoPoint` instance as the latitude of the destination point, which would produce a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1, distance, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to use a latitude that is one degree higher than the current `GeoPoint` instance, which would produce a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2, distance, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to use a longitude that is twice the value of the current `GeoPoint` instance, which would produce a different result than the original code.

DONE.
