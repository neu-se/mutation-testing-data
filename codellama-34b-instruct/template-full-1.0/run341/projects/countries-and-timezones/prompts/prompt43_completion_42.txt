  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` for all countries, rather than a map of countries with their corresponding timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a map of countries with their corresponding timezones, but the timezones would be incorrect because the `getTimezone` function is not being called correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true, ...options }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a map of countries with their corresponding timezones, but the timezones would be deprecated because the `getCountry` function is being called with the `deprecated` option.

DONE.
