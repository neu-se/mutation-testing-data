  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `arguments` would cause the `nodeArgs.push` method to push a `null` element onto the array instead of the `arguments` object, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"arguments"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string containing the word "arguments" instead of the `arguments` object itself would cause the `nodeArgs.push` method to push a string onto the array instead of the `arguments` object, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
()=>arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an arrow function that returns the `arguments` object instead of the `arguments` object itself would cause the `nodeArgs.push` method to push a function onto the
