  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `hasNext()` method, and without them, the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` property is a boolean value that indicates whether there are more operations in the iterator, and without the parentheses, the code would not check the value of this property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method returns the next operation in the iterator, and without the parentheses, the code would not call the method and would not advance the iterator.

DONE.
