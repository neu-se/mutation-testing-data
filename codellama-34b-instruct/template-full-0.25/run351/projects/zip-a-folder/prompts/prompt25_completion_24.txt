  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enable gzip compression, even if the `archiverOptions` object does not specify it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only enable gzip compression if the `archiverOptions` object is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions ? { gzip: true } : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only enable gzip compression if the `archiverOptions` object is truthy, and would use an empty object otherwise.

DONE.
