  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `num` as it is, but the replaced code fragment is adding 1 to the value of `num`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `num` as it is, but the replaced code fragment is multiplying the value of `num` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `num` as it is, but the replaced code fragment is subtracting 1 from the value of `num`.

DONE.
