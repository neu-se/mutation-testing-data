  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `message` is an array, and `message[0]` would be the first element of the array, which may not be the same as `message` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `message` except the first one, which may not be the same as `message` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.pop()` would remove and return the last element of `message`, which may not be the same as `message` itself.

DONE.
