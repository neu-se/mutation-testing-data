  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `undefined`. This means that the new promise would be fulfilled with `undefined`, even if the original promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `undefined`. This means that the new promise would be fulfilled with `undefined`, even if the original promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this
