  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `length` is falsy, while the new code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `length` is equal to 0. These two operators have different behavior when dealing with falsy values, and the new code fragment may produce different results in some cases.

DONE.
