  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is negated, which changes the sign of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is multiplied by 2, which changes the magnitude of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b**(1/2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is raised to the power of 1/2, which changes the behavior of `atan2`.

DONE.
