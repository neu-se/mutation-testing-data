  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(err === true ? null : err, null)` would only call the callback with `null` as the second argument if `err` is `true`, while the new code fragment would always call the callback with `null` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(err === true ? null : err, null)` would only call the callback with `null` as the second argument if `err` is `true`, while the new code fragment would always call the callback with `err` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `err`.
