  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `p = p.source` changes the value of `p` to the source of the promise, while `p = p.source.promise` changes the value of `p` to the promise itself. This could potentially cause the loop to exit prematurely if the `source` property of the promise is not a promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `p = p.then` changes the value of `p` to the `then` function of the promise, while `p = p.source.promise` changes the value of `p` to the promise itself. This could potentially cause the loop to never exit if the `then` function of the promise is not a promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source && p.source.promise
```
This would
