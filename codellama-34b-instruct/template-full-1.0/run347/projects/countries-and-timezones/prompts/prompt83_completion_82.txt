  Sure, here are three mutants for the given code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => <PLACEHOLDER>(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` would be called with the updated `options` argument, which could change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => <PLACEHOLDER>(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` would be called with the `deprecated` option set to `true`, which could change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => <PLACEHOLDER>(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` would be called with the updated `options` argument, which could change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
