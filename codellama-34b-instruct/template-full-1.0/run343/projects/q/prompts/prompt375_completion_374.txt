  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would always return `true`, regardless of the throw state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(threw)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would always return `true`, regardless of the throw state.

DONE.
