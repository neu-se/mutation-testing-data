 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer, "throw", undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a default value for the `arg` parameter in the `continuer` function, which could cause the error handling to behave differently if the `throw` operation is called without an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `continuer` function with a new function that always throws an error, which would cause the async generator to immediately reject with an error instead of properly handling the yielded promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer, "other_verb"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an invalid verb, which would cause an exception to be thrown in the `continuer` function, leading to the async generator immediately rejecting with an error.

DONE.
