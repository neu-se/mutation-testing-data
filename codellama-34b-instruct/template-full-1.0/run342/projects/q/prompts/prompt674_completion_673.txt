  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch1` would refer to a different method in the `Promise` prototype, which could lead to unexpected results when trying to invoke the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with a different context, which could lead to errors when trying to access the `this` context within the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch === isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` method is not a member of the `Promise` prototype, and therefore would not be a valid method to call. Additionally, the comparison operation `===` would return a boolean value, which is not a function and therefore cannot be called.

DONE.
