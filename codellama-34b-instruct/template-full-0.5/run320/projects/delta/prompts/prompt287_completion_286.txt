  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the `if` block when `index` is less than 0, which means it will not execute the `if` block when `index` is greater than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the `if` block when `index` is less than 0, which means it will not execute the `if` block when `index` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the `if` block when `index` is less than 0, which means it will not execute the `if` block when `index` is not equal to 0.

DONE.
