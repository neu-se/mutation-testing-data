  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
