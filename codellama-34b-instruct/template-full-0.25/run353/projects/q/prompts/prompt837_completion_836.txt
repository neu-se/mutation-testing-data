  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with `null` as its `this` value, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with `undefined` as its `this` value, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(process.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with `process.domain` as its `this` value, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
