  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  throw new Error('Handler not found');
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a handler function, while the mutated code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  return () => {
    return 'dummy';
  };
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a handler function that performs a specific operation, while the mutated code would return a dummy function that returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  return () => {
    return 42;
  };
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a handler function that performs a specific operation, while the mutated code would return a function that returns a constant value.

DONE.
