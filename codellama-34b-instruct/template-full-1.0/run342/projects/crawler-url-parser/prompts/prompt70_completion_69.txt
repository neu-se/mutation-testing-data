  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.root()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.root()` is a method that gets the top-level element of a Cheerio object, whereas `cheerio.load()` is a method that loads a HTML string into a Cheerio object. If a Cheerio object is passed as the data argument to the `parse()` function, the `cheerio.root()` method would return a Cheerio object, where the `cheerio.load()` method would fail because it expects a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.noConflict()
```
This would result in different behavior because `$.noConflict()` is a jQuery method that reverts the jQuery alias and the "$" symbol to their previous values. If a Cheerio object is passed as the data argument to the `parse()` function, the `$.noConflict()` method would fail because it expects a jQuery object.
