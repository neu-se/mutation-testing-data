  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable, while `null` is a constant. If the `aborted` variable is set to `null`, the code would behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable, while `undefined` is a primitive value. If the `aborted` variable is set to `undefined`, the code would behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable, while `aborted + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of the `aborted` variable. If the `aborted` variable is set to a non-zero value, the code would behave differently.

DONE.
