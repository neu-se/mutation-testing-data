  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function(value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `result.value` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function(value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `result.value` object, so it would throw an error.
