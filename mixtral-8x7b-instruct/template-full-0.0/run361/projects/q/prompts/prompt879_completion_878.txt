 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error("Buggy node resolver"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new Error object is thrown instead of using the deferred.makeNodeResolver() function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise instead of waiting for the Node.js callback to resolve or reject it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
