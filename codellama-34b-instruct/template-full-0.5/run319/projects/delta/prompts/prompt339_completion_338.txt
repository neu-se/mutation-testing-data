  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the `slice` function to return a different set of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be decremented by 1 instead of incremented, which could cause the `slice` function to return a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be multiplied by 2 instead of incremented, which could cause the `slice` function to return a different set of elements.

DONE.
