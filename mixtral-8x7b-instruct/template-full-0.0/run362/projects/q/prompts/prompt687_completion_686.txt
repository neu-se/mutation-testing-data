 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly uses `Array.prototype.slice` to convert the `arguments` object to an array, while the original code relies on the correct behavior of the `array_slice` utility function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `arguments` is an array-like object with a `slice` method, which is not guaranteed in all environments. The original code uses a more defensive approach by relying on the `array_slice` utility function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
