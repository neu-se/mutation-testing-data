  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while the modified code fragment calculates the square of `a` and subtracts 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while the modified code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while the modified code fragment calculates the product of `a` and `b` and adds 1.

DONE.
