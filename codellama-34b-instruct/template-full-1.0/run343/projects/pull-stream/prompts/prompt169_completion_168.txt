  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort, abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the function arguments has changed, which could potentially cause the function to fail if it relies on a specific argument order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort()` function has been called inside the `cb` function, which could potentially cause the function to always execute the `onAbort` function even if the `abort` condition is not met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has been used instead of the `||` operator, which could potentially cause the `onAbort` function to be called even if the `abort` condition is not met.

DONE.
