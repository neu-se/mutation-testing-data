  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `url` property is undefined, whereas the original code would check if the `url` property is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `url` property has a length greater than 0, whereas the original code would check if the `url` property is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `url` property starts with the string "http", whereas the original code would check if the `url` property is falsy.

DONE.
