  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, but the replaced code fragment uses the `b` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, but the replaced code fragment uses the `a + 1` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, but the replaced code fragment uses the `a - 1` expression.

DONE.
