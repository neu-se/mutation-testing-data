  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return false even if the code is working correctly then all the tasks will go down.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return true even if the code is not working correctly then all the tasks will go up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return the opposite boolean value then all the tasks will change their behavior.

DONE.
