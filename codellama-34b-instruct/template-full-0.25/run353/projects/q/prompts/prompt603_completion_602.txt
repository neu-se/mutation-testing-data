  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `defer` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(new Error("error"))` would cause the promise to be resolved with an error, whereas `defer` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify("error")` would cause the promise to be notified with an error, whereas `defer` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value.

DONE.
