  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the entries of the Map, rather than the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of this._data.keys()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the Map, rather than the entries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const val of this._data.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the Map, rather than the entries.

DONE.
