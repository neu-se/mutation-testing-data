  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem.insert` property is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem.delete` property is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem.retain` property is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
