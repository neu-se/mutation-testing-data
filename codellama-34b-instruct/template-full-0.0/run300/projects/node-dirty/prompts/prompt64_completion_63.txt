  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` is a method that immediately destroys the stream, whereas `end()` is a method that gracefully closes the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `end()` is a method that gracefully closes the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that temporarily blocks writes to the stream, whereas `end()` is a method that gracefully closes the stream.

DONE.
