  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail to parse the URL correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail to parse the URL correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail to parse the URL correctly.

DONE.
