Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the keys of the `urlMap` instead of the values, leading to an array of URLs instead of the corresponding objects containing URL details.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs (tuples) from the `urlMap`, instead of just the values, which would change the structure of the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values()).filter(url => url.url.includes('http'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the values to only include those URLs that contain 'http', potentially omitting some URLs that do not meet this condition.

DONE.
