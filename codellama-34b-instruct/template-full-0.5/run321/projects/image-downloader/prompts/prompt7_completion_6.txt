  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` is a boolean variable, and the new code fragment `extractFilename === true` is a comparison that always evaluates to `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to always be true, even if the `extractFilename` variable is set to `false`, which would result in the `options.dest` path being modified even if the `extractFilename` option is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` is a boolean variable, and the new code fragment `!extractFilename` is a negation that always evaluates to `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to always be false, even if the `extractFilename` variable is set to `true`, which would result in the `options.dest` path not being modified even if the `extractFilename` option is set.
