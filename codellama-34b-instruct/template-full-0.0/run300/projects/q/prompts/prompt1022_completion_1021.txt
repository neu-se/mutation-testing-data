  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `send`, which is a different method that may have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added to the `post` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `function() {}` is added to the `post` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
