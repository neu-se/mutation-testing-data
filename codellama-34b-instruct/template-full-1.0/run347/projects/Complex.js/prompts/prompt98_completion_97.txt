  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== 'i' && tokens[i + 1] !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is 'i' or 'I', while the modified code fragment checks if the next token is not 'i' and not 'I'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is 'i' or 'I', while the modified code fragment checks if the next token is 'j' or 'J'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is 'i' or 'I', while the modified code fragment always returns false.

DONE.
