  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, while the `typeof` operator checks for the type of a variable. In this case, `linkurl` is a string, so `linkurl == "string"` would evaluate to `false`, while `typeof linkurl == "string"` would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.length` checks the length of the string, while `typeof linkurl == "string"` checks the type of the variable. In this case, `linkurl.length` would evaluate to `0` if the string is empty, while `typeof linkurl == "string"` would evaluate to `true` if the variable is a string, regardless of its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.includes("string")
```
This would result in different behavior
