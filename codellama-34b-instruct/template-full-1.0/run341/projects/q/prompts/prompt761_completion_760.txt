  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array, which would break the reference to the original array and cause the `allResolved` function to not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.concat(promises)` would add a copy of the `promises` array to the end of the original array, which would cause the `allResolved` function to not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.splice(0)` would remove all the elements of the `promises` array, which would cause the `allResolved` function to not work as intended.

DONE.
