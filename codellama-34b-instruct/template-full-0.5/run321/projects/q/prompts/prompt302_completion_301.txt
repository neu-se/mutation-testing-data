  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always reject, even if the values are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always resolve, even if the values are not the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x === y || x === z
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to reject if the values are not the same, or if they are not the same as a third value `z`.

DONE.
