  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return a different value for `module`, causing the conditional statement to evaluate differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.exports` would be assigned a different value (or no value at all), which would affect the result of the conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.exports` would be reassigned a new value, which would affect the result of the conditional statement.

DONE.
