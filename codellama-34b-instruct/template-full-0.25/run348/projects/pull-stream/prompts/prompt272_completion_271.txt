  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this replacement code fragment pipes the `stream` object to `process.stdout`, which would cause the stream to be consumed and potentially modify the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.on('data', function(chunk) {
  console.log(chunk.toString());
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this replacement code fragment attaches a `data` event listener to the `stream` object, which would cause the stream to be consumed and potentially modify the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout).on('error', function(err) {
  console.error(err);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply
