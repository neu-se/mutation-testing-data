  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now "rejectionHandled" instead of "unhandledRejection", which would cause the code to emit a different event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now "unhandledRejection" instead of "rejectionHandled", which would cause the code to emit a different event.
