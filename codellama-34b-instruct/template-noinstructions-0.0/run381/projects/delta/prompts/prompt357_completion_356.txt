  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.length` would return the length of the `arg` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `arg` which returns the value of `arg`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.toString()` would return a string representation of the `arg` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `arg` which returns the value of `arg`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the `arg` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `arg` which returns the value of `arg`.

DONE.
