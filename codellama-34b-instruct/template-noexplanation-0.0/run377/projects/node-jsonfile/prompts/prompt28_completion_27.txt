  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `shouldThrow` variable is `true`. This will result in the `err.message` line not being executed, and the function will return `null` instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `shouldThrow` variable is `true`. This will result in the `err.message` line not being executed, and the function will return `null` instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `shouldThrow` variable is `false`. This will result in the `err.message` line being executed, and the function will throw an error instead of returning `null`.
