  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not, whereas the original code fragment `/\/\//` matches the string `"/"` exactly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not, whereas the original code fragment `/\/\//` matches the string `"//"` exactly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/.*?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` after the `.*` makes the `*` match non-greedy, meaning it will match as few characters as possible, whereas the original code fragment `/\/\//` matches as many characters as possible.

DONE.
