Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of the original condition, now checking if the old string has an ending newline character and there are no newlines before adds, instead of checking if it doesn't have an ending newline character and there are no newlines before adds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!newEOFNewline && !noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variables being checked, now looking at the new string's ending newline character and the presence of newlines before adds, which could lead to incorrect handling of the "No newline at end of file" message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline || noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from "and" to "or", now checking if either the old string has an ending newline character or there are no newlines before adds, which would trigger the special case handling more frequently than the original code.
