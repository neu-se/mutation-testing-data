Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `object` into a resolved promise immediately, bypassing any asynchronous behavior that the original `Q` implementation might have provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, "extraArg"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the dispatch call, which may cause the method to behave incorrectly or throw an error if it does not expect more than one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("fetch", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from "get" to "fetch", which may not be defined in the `dispatch` method, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
