  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` would remove characters from the right side of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the left side. This could cause the request to be sent to a different URL than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would convert the URL to uppercase, which could cause the request to be sent to a different server or resource.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would remove the first character of the URL, which could cause the request to be sent to a different server or resource.

DONE.
