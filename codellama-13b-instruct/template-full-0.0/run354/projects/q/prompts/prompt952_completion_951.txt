  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `thisp` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` keyword refers to the arguments passed to the function, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` keyword refers to the `undefined` value, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `thisp` argument.

DONE.
