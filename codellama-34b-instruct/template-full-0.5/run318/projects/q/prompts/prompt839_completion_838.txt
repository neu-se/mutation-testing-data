  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, whereas `void 0` is a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, whereas `void 0` is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, whereas `void 0` is a truthy value.

DONE.
