  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is not related to the `write` operation, and it would not be emitted in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted every time the `write` operation fails, which could happen multiple times in this scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'writable'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writable` event is not related to the `write` operation, and it would not be emitted in this context.

DONE.
