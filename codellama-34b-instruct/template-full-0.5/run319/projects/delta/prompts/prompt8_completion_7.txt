  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a strict equality operator that checks both the value and the type of the operands, whereas `!=` is a non-strict equality operator that checks only the value. In this case, if the value of `attributes[key]` is `null`, the non-strict equality operator would return `true`, but the strict equality operator would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`. In this case, if the value of `attributes[key]` is `undefined`, the non-strict equality operator would return `true`, but the strict equality operator would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
