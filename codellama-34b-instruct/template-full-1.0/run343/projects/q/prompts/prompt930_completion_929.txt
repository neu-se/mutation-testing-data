  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`, whereas `this` in the original code fragment refers to the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `this` in the original code fragment refers to the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is a local variable that is not defined in the original code fragment, whereas `this` in the original code fragment refers to the `Promise` object.

DONE.
