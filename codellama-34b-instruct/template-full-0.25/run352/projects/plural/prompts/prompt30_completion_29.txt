  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crises/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches "thesis" or "crisis" case-insensitively, while the new code fragment matches "thesis" or "crises" case-insensitively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches "thesis" or "crisis" case-insensitively, while the new code fragment matches "thesis" or "crisis" case-insensitively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches "thesis" or "crisis" case-insensitively, while the new code fragment matches "thesis" or "crisis" case-sensitively.

DONE.
