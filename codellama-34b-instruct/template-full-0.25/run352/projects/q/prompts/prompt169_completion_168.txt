  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is from Node.js, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack lines that are from Node.js, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is a function that extracts the file name and line number from a stack line, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack lines that do not have a file name and line number, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is from the Q library, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack lines that are from the
