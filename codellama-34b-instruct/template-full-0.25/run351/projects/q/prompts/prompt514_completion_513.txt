  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(value)` would immediately resolve the promise with the value, whereas `defer` would create a new promise that would be resolved later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(reason)` would immediately reject the promise with the reason, whereas `defer` would create a new promise that would be rejected later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify(reason)` would immediately notify the promise with the reason, whereas `defer` would create a new promise that would be notified later.

DONE.
