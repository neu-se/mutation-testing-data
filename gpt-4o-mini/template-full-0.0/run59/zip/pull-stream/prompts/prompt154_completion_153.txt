Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `onAbort` would mean that the abort callback does not receive the intended abort signal, potentially leading to unhandled abort scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` instead of `onAbort` would cause the abort callback to be invoked with a truthy value, which may not be the expected behavior and could lead to incorrect handling of the abort condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of `onAbort` would mean that the abort callback does not receive a valid function to execute, which could lead to a runtime error or unexpected behavior when trying to call the abort callback.

DONE.
