  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function expects a function as its second argument, but `null` is not a function and will cause the function to return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function expects a function as its second argument, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause the function to return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function expects a function as its second argument, but `() => {}` is an empty function and will not cause the function to return an error.

DONE.
