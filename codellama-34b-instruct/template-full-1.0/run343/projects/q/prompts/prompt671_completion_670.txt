  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value to the function, whereas the original code passes `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `0` as the `this` value to the function, whereas the original code passes `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", ["", args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty string (`""`) as the `this` value to the function, whereas the original code passes `undefined`.

DONE.
