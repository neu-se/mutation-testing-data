  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while this code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the `deferred` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(new Error("Invalid argument"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while this code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while this code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with `null`.

DONE.
