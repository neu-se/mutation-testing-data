  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` method to be called twice on the same input, which could potentially lead to different results if the method is not idempotent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `protocol` property of the `parsedBaseUrl` object to be returned directly, rather than being parsed as a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method of the `parsedBaseUrl` object to be called, which could potentially return a different string representation of the URL than what is returned by the `URL.parse` method.

DONE.
