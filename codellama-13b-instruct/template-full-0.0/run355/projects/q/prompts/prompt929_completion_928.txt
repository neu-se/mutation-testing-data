  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `this` object as the first argument to the `nbind` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(object);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `object` argument as the first argument to the `nbind` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(name);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `name` argument as the first argument to the `nbind` function, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
