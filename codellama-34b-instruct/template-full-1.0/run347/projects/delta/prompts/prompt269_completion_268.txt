  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Delta.op().retain(newOp.retain));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` always returns `null`, while `Delta.op().retain` returns an op with a `retain` property of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(delta.ops.length, newOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops.length` is the number of ops in the delta, while `newOp.retain` is a string representation of the op's retain value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(newOp.retain.length, newOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain.length` is the length of the op's retain value, which may be different from `delta.ops.length`.

DONE
