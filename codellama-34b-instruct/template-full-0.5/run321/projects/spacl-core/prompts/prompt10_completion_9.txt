  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
version !== '1' && version !== '1.0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for versions other than `'1'` or `'1.0'`, regardless of whether the `spec` string contains any wildcards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0'
      ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/
      : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for versions other than `'1'` or `'1.0'`, regardless of whether the `spec` string contains any wildcards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
version !== '1' && version !== '1.0' && spec.match(/\
