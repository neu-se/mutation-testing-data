  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the real part of the complex number is zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the imaginary part of the complex number is not zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

DONE.
