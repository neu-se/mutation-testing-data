  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment, which could potentially reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This change will also cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment, which could potentially reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
