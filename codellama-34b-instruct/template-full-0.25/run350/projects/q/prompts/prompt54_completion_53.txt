  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().slice(8)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string that is a substring of the original string, starting from the 8th character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string that is the original string in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string that is the original string in reverse order.

DONE.
