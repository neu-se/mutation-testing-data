  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number. Changing the function in the code would cause the output to be different and potentially incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number. Changing the function in the code would cause the output to be different and potentially incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number. Changing the function in the code would cause the output to be different and potentially incorrect.

DONE.
