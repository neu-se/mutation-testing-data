  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl, baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseurl` property of `currentUrl` as the second argument to `gettype()`, instead of passing `baseUrl` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl, baseUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseurl` property of `baseUrl` as the second argument to `gettype()`, instead of passing `baseUrl` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `url` property of `currentUrl` as the first argument to `gettype()`, instead of passing `currentUrl` as in the original code.

DONE.
