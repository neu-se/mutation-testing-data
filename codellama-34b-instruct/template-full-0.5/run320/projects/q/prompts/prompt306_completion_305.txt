  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop one iteration earlier than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once.

DONE.
