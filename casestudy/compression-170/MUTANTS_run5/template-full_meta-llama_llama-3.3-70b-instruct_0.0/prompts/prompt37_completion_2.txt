Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHeader
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeHeader` is not a standard method in Node.js HTTP responses, whereas `writeHead` is, so this replacement would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.writeHead(this.statusCode, this.headers)
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to `res` explicitly instead of using `this`, and also passes `this.headers` as an argument, which might not be the intended behavior in all cases, potentially leading to differences in the response headers sent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.flushHeaders
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushHeaders` is not a standard method in Node.js HTTP responses, and using it would likely result in an error, whereas the original `writeHead` method is used to send the response headers.

DONE.
