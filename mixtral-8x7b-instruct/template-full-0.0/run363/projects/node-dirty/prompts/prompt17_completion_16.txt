 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Symbol()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol()` creates a unique symbol that cannot be used as a key in a `Map` object, causing the `set` method to fail silently and not persist the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the key to `Map.prototype.get()` would always return `undefined`, even if the key exists in the map. This could cause unexpected behavior in the `set` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a function as the key to `Map.prototype.get()` would always return `undefined`, even if the key exists in the map. This could cause unexpected behavior in the `set` method.

DONE.
