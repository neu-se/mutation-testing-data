 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the string 'rejected' instead of checking the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 'null' instead of checking the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a bound function instead of the state of the promise. The bound function will always return the same result, regardless of the state of the promise.

DONE.
