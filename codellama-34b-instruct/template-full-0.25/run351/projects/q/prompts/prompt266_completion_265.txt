  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolvedPromise` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality between `resolvedPromise` and the boolean value `true`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `resolvedPromise` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would check for strict inequality between `resolvedPromise` and the boolean value `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolvedPromise` is `false`.

DONE.
