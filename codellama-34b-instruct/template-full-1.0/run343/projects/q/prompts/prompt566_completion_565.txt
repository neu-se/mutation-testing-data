  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.nextTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.nextTick()` is a function that schedules a task to be executed on the next tick of the event loop, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled with the result of a value or promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick().then()

This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick()` is a function that schedules a task to be executed on the next tick of the event loop, whereas `Q.then()` is a function that returns a new promise that is fulfilled with the result of a value or promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolved()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolved()` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of a value or promise, whereas the PLACEHOLDER is a function that
