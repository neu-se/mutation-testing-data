  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different operations in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is being modified, which could affect the outcome of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is being modified, which could affect the outcome of the operation.

DONE.
