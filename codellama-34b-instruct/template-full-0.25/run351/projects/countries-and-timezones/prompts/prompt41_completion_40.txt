  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `prev` value, which would cause the `reduce` function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `prev` value by 2, which would cause the `reduce` function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `prev` value, which would cause the `reduce` function to produce a different output.

DONE.
