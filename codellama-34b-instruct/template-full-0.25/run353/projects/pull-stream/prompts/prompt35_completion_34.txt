  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2]` element is not the same as the `ref[1]` element, which is what the original code fragment was referring to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1] + 1` expression would return a different value than the `ref[1]` element, which is what the original code fragment was referring to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1] * 2` expression would return a different value than the `ref[1]` element, which is what the original code fragment was referring to.

DONE.
