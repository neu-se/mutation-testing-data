  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally track every rejection reason, regardless of whether it was reported or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only track rejection reasons for reported unhandled rejections, and not for all rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.concat(reportedUnhandledRejections)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track rejection reasons for both reported and unreported unhandled rejections, which is redundant and may cause unnecessary memory usage.

DONE.
