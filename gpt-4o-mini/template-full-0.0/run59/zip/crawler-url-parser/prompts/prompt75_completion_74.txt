Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed URL instead of using the dynamic value from the `href` attribute, which may lead to incorrect parsing and extraction of links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('src')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to extract the `src` attribute instead of the `href` attribute, which is not applicable for anchor (`<a>`) tags and would likely result in `undefined` for most cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'baseUrlStr'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the variable name as a string instead of the actual variable value, leading to a failure in parsing the intended base URL.

DONE.
