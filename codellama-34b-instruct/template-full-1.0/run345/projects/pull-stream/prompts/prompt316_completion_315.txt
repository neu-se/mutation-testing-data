  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the `terminate` function and instead call the `cb` function directly, potentially causing the read stream to stay open longer than necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `ended` variable to `null`, allowing the read stream to continue reading even if it has already ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the wrong arguments, potentially causing the read stream to behave unexpectedly or throw an error.

DONE.
