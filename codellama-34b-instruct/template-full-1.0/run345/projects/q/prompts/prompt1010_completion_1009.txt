  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments starting from the 2nd element instead of the 1st.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments starting from the 1st element and ending at the 2nd element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments starting from the 2nd element and ending at the 1st element.

DONE.
