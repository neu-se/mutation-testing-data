  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function takes a single argument, but `φ2` is an array of two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function takes a single argument, but `φ2` is an array of two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function takes a single argument, but `φ2` is an array of two elements.

DONE.
