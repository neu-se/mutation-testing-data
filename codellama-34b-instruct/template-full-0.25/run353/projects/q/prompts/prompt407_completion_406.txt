  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `value` is not a promise, and `false` when it is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the `value` is an object with a `then` method, which is a common characteristic of promises. If the `value` is not a promise, but it has a `then` method, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and if the `value` is a promise, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending
