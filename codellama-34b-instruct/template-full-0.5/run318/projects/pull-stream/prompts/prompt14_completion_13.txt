  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra time, potentially causing the function to return an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last argument, potentially causing the function to return an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the second argument, potentially causing the function to return an unexpected value.

DONE.
