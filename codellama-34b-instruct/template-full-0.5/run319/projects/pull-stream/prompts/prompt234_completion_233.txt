  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is being incremented by 1, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is being multiplied by 2, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is being accessed as an object, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result if it is expecting a different type of input.

DONE.
