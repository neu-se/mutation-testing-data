  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is always `false`, so the condition `if (!Number.isFinite(a['arg'])) {` will never be `true`, even if `a['arg']` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is only `true` for `NaN` values, but the condition `if (!Number.isFinite(a['arg'])) {` can also be `true` for infinite values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a global function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the argument is a finite number. It does not check for infinity the way `Number.isFinite` does.

DONE.
