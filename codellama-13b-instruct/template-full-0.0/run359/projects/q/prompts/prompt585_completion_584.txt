  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.done` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.spread` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.async` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error if called.

DONE.
