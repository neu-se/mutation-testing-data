  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined on the `Complex` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError` if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined on the `Complex` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError` if called.

DONE.
