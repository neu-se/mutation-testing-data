  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Placeholder error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always emit an error with the message "Placeholder error", whereas the original code would only emit an error if the read stream emitted an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the queue of any pending writes, whereas the original code would leave the queue unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the in-memory database of all data, whereas the original code would only delete the data associated with the key that was being removed.

DONE.
