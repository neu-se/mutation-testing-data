  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call the `deferred.reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call the `deferred.reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is not a valid callback, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call the `de
