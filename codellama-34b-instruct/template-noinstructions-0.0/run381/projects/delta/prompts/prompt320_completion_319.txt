  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `Delta` object to retain one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `Delta` object to retain one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `Delta` object to retain twice as many characters as intended.

DONE.
