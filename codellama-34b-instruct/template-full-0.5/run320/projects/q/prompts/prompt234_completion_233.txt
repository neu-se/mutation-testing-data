  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promise` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.source` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.valueOf()` returns a different value than `resolvedPromise`.

DONE.
