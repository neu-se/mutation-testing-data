  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.length - 2` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this code fragment uses `w.length - 1` to remove only the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.length - 2` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this code fragment uses `w.length - 3` to remove the last three characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 4) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
