 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `arguments` object directly. This could cause issues if the code relies on the `arguments` object's mutability or its `callee` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(arguments)
