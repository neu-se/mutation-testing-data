  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current operation and move to the next one, potentially causing the loop to miss an operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move back to the previous operation, potentially causing the loop to repeat an operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move to the next operation, but with a different index, potentially causing the loop to skip or repeat operations.

DONE.
