  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.assign() returns a new object, while cloneDeep() returns a deep copy of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.create(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.create() creates a new object that inherits from the prototype of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = {...b}
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator creates a shallow copy of the object, while cloneDeep() creates a deep copy.

DONE.
