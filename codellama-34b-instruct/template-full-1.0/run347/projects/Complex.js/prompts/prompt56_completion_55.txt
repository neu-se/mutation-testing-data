  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value that is added to `a['arg']`, changing the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin()` function is called with a different argument, which would change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] - Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos()` function is called with a different argument, which would change the result of the `Math.cos()` function.

DONE.
