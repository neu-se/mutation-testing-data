 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { deferred.resolve(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is not propagated and gets resolved instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { deferred.reject(new Error('Manually rejected')); }
