  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra comma at the end of the `Map` entry, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `undefined` value at the end of the `Map` entry, which would cause the `Map` to have a different size than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `null` value at the end of the `Map` entry, which would cause the `Map` to have a different size than expected.

DONE.
