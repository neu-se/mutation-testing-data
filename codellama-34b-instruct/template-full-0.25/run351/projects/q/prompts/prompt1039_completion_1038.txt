  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)` which would reject the promise with the given error, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the error, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)` which would reject the promise with the given error, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with a new error, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.
