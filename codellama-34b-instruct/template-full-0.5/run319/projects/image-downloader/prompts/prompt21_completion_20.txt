  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` property is not defined in the options object, and the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/^.*\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the last occurrence of a forward slash and any characters before it, which would change the file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the file path by forward slashes and the `pop` method would return the last element, which would change the file name.

DONE.
