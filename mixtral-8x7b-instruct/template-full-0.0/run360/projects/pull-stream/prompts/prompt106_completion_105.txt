 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `done` directly, while the mutated code wraps `done` in an arrow function, potentially changing the context and causing issues if `this` is used within the `done` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method changes the context of the `done` function, potentially causing issues if `this` is used within the `done` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(done)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules the `done` function to be called asynchronously, which may not be expected by the test suite.

DONE.
