 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for explicit equality with `undefined` instead of using the negated existence check with the bang operator `!`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'country' in result
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string 'country' is a property of the result object, instead of checking if the `country` variable is a key in the `result` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(result, country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `hasOwnProperty` method to check if the `country` variable is a direct property of the `result` object, instead of checking if the `country` variable is a key in the `result` object.

DONE.
