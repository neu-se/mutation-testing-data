  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create()
```
This creates a new archiver instance, which is different from the original code fragment `archiver`, which is a function that returns a new archiver instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create({})
```
This creates a new archiver instance with an empty options object, which is different from the original code fragment `archiver`, which does not accept any options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create({}, {})
```
This creates a new archiver instance with two empty options objects, which is different from the original code fragment `archiver`, which only accepts one options object.

DONE.
