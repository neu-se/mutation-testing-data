  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = snapshot.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of the resolved promise to the `promises` array, rather than the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the original promise to the `promises` array, rather than the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = snapshot.value + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the resolved value of the promise plus one to the `promises` array, rather than the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
