  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a function that checks if a value is a rejected promise, while `isPromise` is a function that checks if a value is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` is the logical negation of `isPromise`, which would cause the code to check if the value is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, while `isPromise` is a function that checks if a value is a promise.

DONE.
