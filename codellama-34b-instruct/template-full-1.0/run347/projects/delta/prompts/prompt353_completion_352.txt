  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument, which would cause the delta to be modified in a way that is not intended by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(inverted.ops.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the delta to be modified in a way that is not intended by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a negative argument, which would cause the delta to be modified in a way that is not intended by the original code.

DONE.
