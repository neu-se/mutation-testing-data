  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'call'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the chosen method is `apply`, which applies the `this` argument to the function, while `call` does not. This change would cause the function to be called with a different `this` argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bind'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the chosen method is `apply`, which binds `this` to the function, while `bind` does not. This change would cause the function to be called without being bound to a specific `this` argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
