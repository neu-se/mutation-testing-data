  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(value).then(fulfilled, rejected, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `Q` function, which is not a promise and does not have a `then` method. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(value).then(fulfilled, rejected, progressed).then(null, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called twice, with the second call having no effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(value).then(fulfilled, rejected, progressed).then(null, null).then(fulfilled, rejected, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called three times, with the third call having no effect.

DONE.
