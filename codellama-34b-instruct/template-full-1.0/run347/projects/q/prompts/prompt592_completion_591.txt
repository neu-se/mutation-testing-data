  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive 1 as an argument instead of the expected arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive -1 as an argument instead of the expected arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive an array [1, 2] as an argument instead of the expected arguments object.

DONE.
