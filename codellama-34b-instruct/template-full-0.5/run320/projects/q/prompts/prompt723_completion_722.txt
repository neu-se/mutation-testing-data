  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original check for a promise, allowing non-promise values to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, causing the code to always assume that the value is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, causing the code to always assume that the value is a promise.

DONE.
