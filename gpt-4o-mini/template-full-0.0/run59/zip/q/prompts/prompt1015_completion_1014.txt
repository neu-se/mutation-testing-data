Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would immediately resolve the promise without waiting for the callback to be executed, potentially leading to incorrect handling of asynchronous results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because using `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of whether the operation was successful, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because binding the first argument to 'error' would cause the resolver to always treat the result as an error, even if the operation completed successfully, thus incorrectly signaling failure.

DONE.
