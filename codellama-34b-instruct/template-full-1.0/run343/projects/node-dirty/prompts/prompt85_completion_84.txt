  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.slice` returns a new string, whereas `buffer.split` returns an array of strings. In the context of the code, `buffer.split` is used to split the buffer into an array of rows, each row representing a key-value pair. If `buffer.slice` is used instead, the resulting array would contain strings that are each a portion of the buffer, rather than complete rows. This would lead to incorrect parsing and interpretation of the data, potentially leading to errors or incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.substring` returns a new string, whereas `buffer.split` returns an array of strings. Similarly to the previous option, using `buffer.substring` instead of `buffer.split` would result in incorrect parsing and interpretation of the data, potentially leading to errors or incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
