Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `test` function, meaning that the callback will be invoked when `test(data)` returns `false` instead of `true`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of valid data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `data` is strictly equal to `null`, which would cause the callback to be invoked only when `data` is `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `data` has a length greater than 0, which would only trigger the callback for non-empty arrays or strings, potentially missing valid data that is empty or not an array/string.

DONE.
