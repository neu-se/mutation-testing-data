  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which could cause the calculation of the complex exponent to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which could cause the calculation of the complex exponent to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause the calculation of the complex exponent to be incorrect.

DONE.
