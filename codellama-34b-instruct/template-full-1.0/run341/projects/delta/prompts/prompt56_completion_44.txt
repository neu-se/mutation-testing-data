  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire `ops` array with the value of the `ops` property of the `newOp` object, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `ops` array with the value of the `ops` property of the `newOp` object at the current index, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `ops` array with the value of the `ops` property of the `this` object, which is likely not the intended behavior.

DONE.
