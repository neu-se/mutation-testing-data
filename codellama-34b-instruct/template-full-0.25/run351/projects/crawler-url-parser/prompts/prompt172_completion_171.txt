  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.parse = parse;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `parse` function, which is not exported in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.extract = extract;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `extract` function, which is not exported in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.gettype = gettype;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `gettype` function, which is not exported in the original code.

DONE.
