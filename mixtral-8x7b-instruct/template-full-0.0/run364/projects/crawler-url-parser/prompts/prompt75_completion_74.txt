 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
$('script')[0].attribs['src']
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects the 'src' attribute of the first script tag instead of the 'href' attribute of the 'a' tags.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
$('a').eq(0).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it only selects the 'href' attribute of the first 'a' tag instead of all 'a' tags.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
$('a').find('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to find the 'href' element within the 'a' tags instead of getting the 'href' attribute.

DONE.
