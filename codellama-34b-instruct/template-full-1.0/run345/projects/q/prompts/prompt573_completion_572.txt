  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an undefined element into the arguments array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a null reference error when trying to access the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(args++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the args variable by 1, which could cause unexpected results if the code relies on the arguments length.

DONE.
