  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string matches the pattern, while this new code fragment checks if the string does not match the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string matches the pattern, while this new code fragment checks if the string does not match the pattern and is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string matches the pattern, while this new code fragment checks if the string does not match the pattern and is not undefined, and if both conditions are true, it would return a
