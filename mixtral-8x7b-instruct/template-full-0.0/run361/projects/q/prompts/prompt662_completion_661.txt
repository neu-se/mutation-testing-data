 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for `array_slice()`, causing an exception and changing the flow of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the `dispatch("apply", [...])` method, which might expect an array with specific content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the `dispatch("apply", [...])` method, which might expect `this` to be the current object but instead receives the value of the current `this` in the context where the `invoke` method is called.

DONE.
