  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the equality of the `deprecated` property with `true`, while the new code fragment checks for the inequality of the `deprecated` property with `true`. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones if the `deprecated` property is not equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the equality of the `deprecated` property with `true`, while the new code fragment checks for the negation of the `deprecated` property. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones if the `deprecated` property is not `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== 'true'
```
This would
