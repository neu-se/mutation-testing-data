  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `point` has a `type` property but not a `coordinates` property, whereas the original code would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `point` does not have a `type` property but does have a `coordinates` property, whereas the original code would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') || point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `point` has either a `type` or `coordinates
