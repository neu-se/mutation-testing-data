  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would match any string that contains at least one character, while the new code fragment `0` would only match the empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would match any string that contains at least one character, while the new code fragment `-1` would only match the empty string and any string that contains at least one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would match any string that contains at least one character, while the new code fragment `Infinity` would only match the empty string and any string that contains at least one character.

DONE.
