  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, but this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, but this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](-1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, but this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is negative one.

DONE.
