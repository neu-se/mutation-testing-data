Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `resolvedPromise` would indicate that the promise is not resolved, leading to potential errors when the promise's value is expected to be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `resolvedPromise` would also indicate that the promise is not resolved, which could cause issues in promise chaining or when checking the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not a promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string instead of `resolvedPromise` would break the expected behavior of the promise, as it would not be a valid promise object, leading to type errors when methods expecting a promise are called.

DONE.
