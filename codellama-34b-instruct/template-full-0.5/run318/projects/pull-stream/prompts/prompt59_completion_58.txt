  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator performs a logical AND operation on the values of `abort` and `end`, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if both `abort` and `end` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator performs a logical OR operation on the values of `abort` and `end`, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if either `abort` or `end` is truthy.
