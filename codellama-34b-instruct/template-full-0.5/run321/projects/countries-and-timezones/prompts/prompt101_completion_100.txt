  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the timezone is not deprecated, while the new code fragment checks if the timezone is deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the timezone is not deprecated, while the new code fragment checks if the timezone is deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the timezone is not deprecated, while the new code fragment checks if the timezone is deprecated.

DONE.
