 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is always called with a null error, even if an error occurred. This could hide potential issues in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => cb(new Error('Test error'))
