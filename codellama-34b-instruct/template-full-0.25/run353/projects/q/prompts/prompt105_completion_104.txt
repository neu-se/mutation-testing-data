  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index + 1], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is incremented before being used as an index into the array, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index - 1], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is decremented before being used as an index into the array, which would cause the loop to iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index + 2], index + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is incremented by 2 before being used as an index into the array, which would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array and also cause the loop to iterate over the array twice as fast.

DONE.
