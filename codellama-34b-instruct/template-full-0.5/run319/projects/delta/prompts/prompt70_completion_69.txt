  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `!=` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is compared to a negative number instead of a positive number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is compared to 0 instead of being greater than 0.

DONE.
