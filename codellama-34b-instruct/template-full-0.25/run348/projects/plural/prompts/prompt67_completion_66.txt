  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'memo'`, which would have returned the singular form of the word "memo", while the new code fragment would return the plural form "memos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'memos'`, which would have returned the plural form of the word "memo", while the new code fragment would return the singular form "memo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'memos'`, which would have returned the plural form of the word "memo", while the new code fragment would return a different plural form "memoes".

DONE.
