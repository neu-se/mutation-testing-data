  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method immediately, rather than on the next tick of the event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush.bind(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `_flush` method to a different context, potentially changing the behavior of the method when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(this._flush.bind(this), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the call to `_flush` until the next tick of the event loop, rather than calling it immediately.

DONE.
