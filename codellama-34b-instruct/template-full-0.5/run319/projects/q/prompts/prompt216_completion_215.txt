  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, whereas `coerce` is a function that converts a value to a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a resolved promise, whereas `coerce` is a function that converts a value to a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that takes an array of promises and returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved, whereas `coerce` is a function that converts a value to a promise.

DONE.
