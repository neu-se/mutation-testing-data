  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expected a number as an argument, but `null` is not a number and will cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expected a number as an argument, but `undefined` is not a number and will cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expected a positive number as an argument, but `0` is a valid number that will cause the function to return the same point it was called with.

DONE.
