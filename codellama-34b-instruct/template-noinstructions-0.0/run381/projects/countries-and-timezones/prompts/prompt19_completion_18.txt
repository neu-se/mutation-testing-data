  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return a string instead of an object, which would break the `buildCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return `null` instead of an object, which would break the `buildCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return `undefined` instead of an object, which would break the `buildCountry` function.

DONE.
