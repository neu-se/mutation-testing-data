  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the code to insert an operation at the end of the list, even if the operation would have been merged with the last operation in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the code to insert an operation at the end of the list, even if the operation would have been merged with the last operation in the list, as it would check if the last operation's attributes are null, not the new operation's.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the code to insert an operation at the end of the list, even if the operation would have been merged with the last operation in the list, as it would check if the last operation has a retain attribute, not the new operation's.
