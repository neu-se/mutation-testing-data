  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bad"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a syntax error, since "bad" is not a valid keyword in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is a valid keyword in JavaScript, but it would not be a valid argument for the "verb" parameter in the "continuer" function, since it is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the number 3 as the "verb" parameter in the "continuer" function, which would be incorrect since it is not a string.

DONE.
