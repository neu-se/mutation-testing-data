  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it may match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it may match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it may match a different set of strings.

DONE.
