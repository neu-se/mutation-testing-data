  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, which is always positive, while the original code fragment uses `a` directly, which may be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` would add 1 to the value of `a`, while the original code fragment uses `a` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number, while the original code fragment uses `a` directly.

DONE.
