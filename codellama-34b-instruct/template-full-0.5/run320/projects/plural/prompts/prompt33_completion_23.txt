  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a different substring than `w.substr`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a different substring than `w.substr`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.charAt
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.charAt` would return a different character than `w.substr`, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
