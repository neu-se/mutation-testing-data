  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all countries for a given timezone, including those that are deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all countries for a given timezone, including those that are not deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, { allTimezones: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the non-deprecated countries for a given timezone.

DONE.
