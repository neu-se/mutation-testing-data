  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2]` element is not the same as the `ref[1]` element, which is what the original code fragment was referencing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[3]` element is not the same as the `ref[1]` element, which is what the original code fragment was referencing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[4]` element is not the same as the `ref[1]` element, which is what the original code fragment was referencing.

DONE.
