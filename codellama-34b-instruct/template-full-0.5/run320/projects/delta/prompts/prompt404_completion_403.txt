  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `otherData` from a reference to a number, which could cause the `transform` method to behave differently when handling the `retain` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `otherData` from a reference to a number, which could cause the `transform` method to behave differently when handling the `retain` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `otherData` from a reference to a number, which could cause the `transform` method to behave differently when handling the `retain` operation.

DONE.
