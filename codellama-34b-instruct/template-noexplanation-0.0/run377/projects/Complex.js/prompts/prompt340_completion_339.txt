  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 1
```
This change will cause the `acsc` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === -1
```
This change will cause the `acsc` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b === 0
```
This change will cause the `acsc` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
