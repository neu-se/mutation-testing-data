  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toLocaleString` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

DONE.
