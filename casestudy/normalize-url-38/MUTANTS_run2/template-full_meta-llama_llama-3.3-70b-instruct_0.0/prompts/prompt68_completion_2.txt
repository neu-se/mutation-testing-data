Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is being applied to the pathname instead of the hostname, which could lead to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is being applied to the lowercase version of the hostname, which could lead to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain if the hostname contains uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'urlObj.hostname'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'urlObj.hostname' is being tested against the regular expression instead of the actual value of urlObj.hostname, which would always result in the 'www.' subdomain not being removed.

DONE.
