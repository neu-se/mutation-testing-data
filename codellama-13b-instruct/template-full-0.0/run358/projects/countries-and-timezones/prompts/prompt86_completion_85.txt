  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c.id` property is a string, while the original code fragment `c` is an object. This could cause issues if the `getCountry` function is expecting an object as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c.name` property is a string, while the original code fragment `c` is an object. This could cause issues if the `getCountry` function is expecting an object as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.timezones, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c.timezones` property is an array of strings, while the original code fragment `c` is an object. This could cause issues if the `getCountry` function is expecting an object as its first argument.

DONE.
