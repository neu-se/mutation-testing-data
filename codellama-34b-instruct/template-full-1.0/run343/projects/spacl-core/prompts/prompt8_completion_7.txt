  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a different method than `match` and will have a different purpose.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is also a different method than `match` and will have a different purpose.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a specified number of characters from a string, and is not related to the purpose of the original code fragment.

DONE.
