 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3 - (i % 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it alternates between `ref[3]` and `ref[2]` based on the loop iteration, instead of consistently accessing `ref[2]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it randomly selects an index from the `ref` array instead of consistently accessing `ref[2]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(-1)[0]
