  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `value[name]` would be called as a function, rather than having the `apply` method called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with a bound `this` value, rather than calling `apply` on `value[name]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would call `value[name]` with `value` as the `this` value, rather than using the `apply` method.

DONE.
