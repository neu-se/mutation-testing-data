Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host !== null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `parsedUrl.host` is not null, which would allow the code to execute the block even when `parsedUrl.host` is valid, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.host && !baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `parsedUrl.host` and `baseUrlStr` are falsy, which would prevent the block from executing if either is truthy, leading to a failure in handling valid base URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || !baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the block to execute if `parsedUrl.host` is null or if `baseUrlStr` is falsy, which could lead to incorrect handling of URLs when a valid base URL is provided.

DONE.
