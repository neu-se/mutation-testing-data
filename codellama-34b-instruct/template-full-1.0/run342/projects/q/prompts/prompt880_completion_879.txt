  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` expects a function as an argument, passing `undefined` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because a no-op function would be passed as the resolver, which would not have any effect on the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err) { throw err; })
```
This would result in different behavior because a function that throws an error would be passed as the resolver, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
