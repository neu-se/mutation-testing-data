  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which would replace all occurrences of the BOM character, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which would make the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would also match the BOM character in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/gm, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which would replace all occurrences of the BOM character, not just the first one, and the `m` flag is added, which would make the regular expression match across multiple lines.

DONE.
