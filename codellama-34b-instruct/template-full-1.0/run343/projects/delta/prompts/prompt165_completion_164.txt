  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `otherIter.peekType()`. This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekType()` method returns the type of the next operation in the other iterator, while `thisIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the this iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `otherIter.peekLength()`. This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the other iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the this iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `otherIter.peekOp().retain`. This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekOp()` returns the current operation in the other iterator, and `retain` is a property of the operation.

DONE.
