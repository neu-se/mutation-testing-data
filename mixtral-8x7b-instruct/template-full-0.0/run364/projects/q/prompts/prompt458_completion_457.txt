 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would receive a `null` value, which could cause unexpected behavior if not properly handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would receive a number, which could cause unexpected behavior if not properly handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would receive an empty object, which could cause unexpected behavior if not properly handled.

These changes would not necessarily cause the tests to fail, but they could expose weaknesses in the test suite by introducing unexpected behavior that is not accounted for in the tests. DONE.
