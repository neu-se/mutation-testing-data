  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `test` function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits and returns `false` as soon as one of its operands is `false`, regardless of the value of the other operand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits and returns `true` as soon as one of its operands is `true`, regardless of the value of the other operand.

DONE.
