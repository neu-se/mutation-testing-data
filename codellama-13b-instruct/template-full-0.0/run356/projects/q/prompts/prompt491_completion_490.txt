  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the `this` keyword, which refers to the promise object, instead of the `promise` variable, which is the promise object that was passed to the `trackRejection` function. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a different object than the one that was passed to the `trackRejection` function, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the `promise` variable, which is the promise object that was passed to the `trackRejection` function, instead of the `this` keyword, which refers to the promise object. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the same object as the one that was passed to the `trackRejection` function, which
