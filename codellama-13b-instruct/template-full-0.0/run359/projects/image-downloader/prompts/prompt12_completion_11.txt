  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `pathname` to lowercase, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `pathname` to uppercase, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would remove the first character of the `pathname`, which could affect the behavior of the code.

DONE.
