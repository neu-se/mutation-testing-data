  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `untrackRejection` function think that the promise has been resolved, but it actually hasn't. This would cause the function to return `true` even though the promise is still unresolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `untrackRejection` function think that the promise has been resolved with no value, but it actually hasn't. This would cause the function to return `true` even though the promise is still unresolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `untrackRejection` function think that the promise has been resolved to a rejection, but it actually hasn't. This would cause the function to return `true` even though the promise is still unresolved.

DONE.
