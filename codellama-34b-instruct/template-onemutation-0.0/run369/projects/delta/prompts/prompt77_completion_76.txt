  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if it is not an object. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `lastOp` is not an object, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
