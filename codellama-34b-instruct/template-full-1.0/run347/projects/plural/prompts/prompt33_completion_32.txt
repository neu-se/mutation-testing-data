  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` and `slice` have different meanings and uses in JavaScript. `substr` is used to extract a portion of a string, while `slice` is used to extract a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `substr` have different uses and meanings in JavaScript. `substring` is used to extract a portion of a string, while `substr` is used to extract a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.charAt
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt` and `substr` have different uses and meanings in JavaScript. `charAt` is used to extract a single character from a string, while `substr` is used to extract a portion of an array.

DONE.
