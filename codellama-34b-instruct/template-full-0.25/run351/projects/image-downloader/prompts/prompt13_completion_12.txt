  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI component, while `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URI.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes the entire URI, while `decodeURIComponent` decodes the URI component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lowercase the decoded basename, while the original code does not modify the decoded basename.

DONE.
