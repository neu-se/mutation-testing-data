  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(start, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the elements from the start index, up to and excluding the end index. This would cause the splice method to modify the wrong ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat([newOp])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the newOp to the end of the ops array, instead of inserting it at the correct index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the newOp to the wrong index in the ops array.

DONE.
