 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[#].*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match any '#' character followed by any number of characters, instead of only matching after the '#' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/#.+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match one or more characters after the '#' character, instead of matching any number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[?].*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match any '?' character followed by any number of characters, which would affect query parameters instead of the fragment.

DONE.
