  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains any non-standard data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver, options.throws)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains any invalid data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver, options.throws, options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains any non-UTF-8 characters.

DONE.
