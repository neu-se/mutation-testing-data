  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.substring(0, rowStr.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the string, potentially causing the JSON.parse() function to fail due to invalid JSON syntax.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr[0].toUpperCase() + rowStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capitalize the first character of the string, potentially causing the JSON.parse() function to fail due to unexpected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the string, potentially causing the JSON.parse() function to fail due to unexpected data.

DONE.
