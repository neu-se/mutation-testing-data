Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.unshift(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the key to the beginning of the `keys` array instead of the end, resulting in a reversed order of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to push the value of the property instead of the key, which would lead to an array of values instead of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys[key] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a boolean value to the `keys` array at the index of `key`, which does not correctly store the keys and would lead to an array with undefined values and a sparse structure.

DONE.
