  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles unhandled errors, while `onUnhandledError` is a local variable that is not defined in the provided code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.onerror` is a function that handles unhandled errors, while `onUnhandledError` is a local variable that is not defined in the provided code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` is a function that schedules a function to be executed on the next tick of the event loop, while `onUnhandledError` is a local variable that is not defined in the provided code.

DONE.
