  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `abort()` is a function call with no arguments.

DONE.
