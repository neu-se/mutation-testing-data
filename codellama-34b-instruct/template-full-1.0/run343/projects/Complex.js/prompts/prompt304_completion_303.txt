  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to `a` would cause the `sin` and `cos` functions to return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a` by 2 would cause the `sin` and `cos` functions to return different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the division of `a` by 2 would cause the `sin` and `cos` functions to return different values.

DONE.
