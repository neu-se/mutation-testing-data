  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands[0]` is the first operand of the `when` method, which is the promise that is being resolved. In the original code, the `operands[1]` is the progress operand, which is not used in this case. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `operands[0]`, we are passing the promise that is being resolved as the progress operand, which would cause the `when` method to be called with a progress operand that is not a function, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and therefore cannot be called as a function. In the original code, the `operands[1]` is the progress operand, which is a function that is called with the progress value. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `undefined`, we are passing an invalid value as the progress oper
