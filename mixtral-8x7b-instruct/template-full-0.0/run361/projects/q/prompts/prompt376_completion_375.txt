 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is used in the original code to handle progress notifications, while `deferred.resolve` would mark the promise as resolved with the provided value, effectively bypassing the progress handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
