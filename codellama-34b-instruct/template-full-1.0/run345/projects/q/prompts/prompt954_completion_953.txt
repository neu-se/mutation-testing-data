  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because with `deferred.resolve`, the rejected promise would be resolved, causing the `fail` handler to not be called, even if an error occurs in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because with `Promise.reject`, a new rejected promise would be created, which would not be caught by the `fail` handler of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because with `undefined`, the `fail` handler would not be called, even if an error occurs in the promise chain.

DONE.
