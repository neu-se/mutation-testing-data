  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\/index\.[^/]+$/` matches any URL that contains the string `/index.` followed by any character that is not a `/` until the end of the string. In contrast, the original code fragment `/\/index\.[a-z]+$/` matches any URL that contains the string `/index.` followed by one or more letters `a-z` until the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\/default\.[^/]+$/` matches any URL that contains the string `/default.` followed by any character that is not a `/` until the end of the string. In contrast, the original code fragment `/\/default\.[a-z]+$/` matches any URL that contains the string `/default.` followed by one or more letters `a-z` until the end of the string
