  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(null, null)` is a function call that returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` is a function call that returns `undefined`, but `defer` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null, 0)` is a function call that returns `undefined`, but `defer` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
