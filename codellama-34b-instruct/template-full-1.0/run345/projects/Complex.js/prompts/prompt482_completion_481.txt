  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the complex number is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the check for finiteness, making the `isInfinite` function always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the real part of the complex number, and would always return true if the real part is positive.

DONE.
