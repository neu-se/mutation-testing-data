  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` or `true` value as the first argument, and the `done` function or a new anonymous function as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` or `true` value as the first argument, and the `done` function as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment.
