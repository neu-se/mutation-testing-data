Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method name from "allSettled" to "allRejected", which implies that the function would now handle rejected promises differently, potentially leading to unexpected results when all promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "anySettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the last argument from "allSettled" to "anySettled", which suggests a different functionality that may not align with the original intent of resolving all promises, leading to confusion and incorrect promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the last argument from "allSettled" to "allFulfilled", which implies that the function would only consider fulfilled promises and ignore any that are rejected, thus altering the expected behavior of the function.

DONE.
