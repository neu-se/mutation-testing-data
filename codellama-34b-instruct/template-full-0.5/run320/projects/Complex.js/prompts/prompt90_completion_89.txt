  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator is now using the `+` operator instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the ternary operator is now being multiplied by 2, which would cause the result to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the ternary operator is now being divided by 2, which would cause the result to be incorrect.

DONE.
