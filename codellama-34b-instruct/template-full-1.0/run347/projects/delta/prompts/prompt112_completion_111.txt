  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Op>
```
This would result in a type error because `<Op>` is not a valid value for the `delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<newOp>
```
This would result in a type error because `<newOp>` is not a valid value for the `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<lastOp.attributes>
```
This would result in a type error because `<lastOp.attributes>` is not a valid value for the `delete` property.

DONE.
