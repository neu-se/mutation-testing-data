 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array and returns it, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array and returns it, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array by removing or replacing existing elements, whereas `unshift` simply adds an element to the beginning of the array without modifying the existing elements.

DONE.
