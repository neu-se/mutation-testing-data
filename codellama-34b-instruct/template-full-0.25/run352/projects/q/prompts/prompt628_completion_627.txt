  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being added to the array, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being added to the array, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the number of arguments.

DONE.
