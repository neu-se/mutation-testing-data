  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` function to be called even when it is not provided, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof done !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` function to be called only when it is not a function, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` function to be called only when it is not equal to `true`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
