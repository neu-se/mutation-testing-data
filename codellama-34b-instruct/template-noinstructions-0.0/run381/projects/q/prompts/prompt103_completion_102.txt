  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the current element in the array to null instead of accessing it.

DONE.
