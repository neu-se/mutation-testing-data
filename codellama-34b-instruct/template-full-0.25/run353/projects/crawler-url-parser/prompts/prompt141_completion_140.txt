  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to split the path, while the new code uses a backslash. This could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to split the path, while the new code uses a space. This could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to split the path, while the new code uses a pipe symbol. This could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
