  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` variable would be incremented by 1, which could affect the program's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` variable would be decremented by 1, which could affect the program's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could affect the program's execution.

DONE.
