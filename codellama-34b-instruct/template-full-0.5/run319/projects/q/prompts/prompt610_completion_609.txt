  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is being called with an additional argument, which would cause the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", ["key", key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is being called with a different key, which would cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is being called with the same key twice, which would cause the method to return the same value twice.

DONE.
