  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function with base `e` instead of the natural logarithm, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(x) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the natural logarithm of `x` instead of the exponential function, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of `x` instead of the exponential function, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
