  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the callbacks if there are no errors, while this new code fragment executes the callbacks if there are errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the callbacks if there are no errors, while this new code fragment executes the callbacks if there are no errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 || err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the callbacks if there are no errors, while this new code fragment executes the callbacks if there are errors or if there are no callbacks.

DONE.
