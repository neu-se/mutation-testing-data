 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` immediately returns a resolved promise, while the original code uses the `Q` function which might have additional logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` immediately creates a rejected promise, while the original code checks if `error` is a string and creates an `Error` object if it is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, while the original code uses a pre-existing deferred object.

DONE.
