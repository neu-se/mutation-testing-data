 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with an empty array as its `this` context, instead of the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with `null` as its `this` context, instead of the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with a blank function as its `this` context, instead of the `promise` object.

These changes would affect the behavior of the code because the `fallback` function relies on the `promise` object to handle operations that are not supported by the descriptor. By changing the `this` context of the `fallback` function, we introduce a difference in behavior that could
