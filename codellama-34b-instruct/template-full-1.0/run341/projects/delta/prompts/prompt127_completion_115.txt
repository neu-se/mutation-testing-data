  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `next()` returns the next element and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` on the other iterator would advance the iteration, potentially causing the two iterators to get out of sync.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(1)` would advance the iteration by 1 element, potentially causing the two iterators to get out of sync.

DONE.
