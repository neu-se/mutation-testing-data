  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged if it ends with "ics", while the new code fragment appends "es" to the word. This would result in different plural forms for words that end with "ics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged if it ends with "ics", while the new code fragment replaces "ics" with "ices". This would result in different plural forms for words that end with "ics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ixes') }
```
This would result in different behavior because
