  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `http://` protocol, while the new code fragment is using the `https://` protocol. This could potentially cause issues if the URL being parsed is not configured to use the `https://` protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `http://` protocol, while the new code fragment is using the `ftp://` protocol. This could potentially cause issues if the URL being parsed is not configured to use the `ftp://` protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `http://` protocol, while the new code fragment is using the `file://` protocol. This could potentially cause issues if the URL being parsed is not configured to use the `file://` protocol.
