  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the comparison to evaluate to false, even if a is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the comparison to evaluate to true, even if a is not a string or is not equal to the string 'undefined'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the comparison to evaluate to true, even if a is not of type 'undefined'.

DONE.
