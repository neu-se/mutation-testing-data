  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || object_hasOwnProperty(object, key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has the property `key + 1` in addition to `key`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object_hasOwnProperty(object, key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the object has both `key` and `key + 1` properties, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) ^ object_hasOwnProperty(object, key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the XOR of the two property checks, which could cause the
