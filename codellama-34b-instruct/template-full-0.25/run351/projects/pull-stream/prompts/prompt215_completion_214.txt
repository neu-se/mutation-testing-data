  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would have called the `map` function with the `data` argument, but this replacement code fragment would call `cb` with `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would have called the `map` function with the `data` argument, but this replacement code fragment would call `cb` with `err` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would have called the `map` function with the `data` argument, but this replacement code fragment would call `cb` with `aborted` as the first argument and `data
