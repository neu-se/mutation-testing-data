 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
''.concat(strings[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new string by concatenating an empty string with `strings[0]`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[...strings[0]]
