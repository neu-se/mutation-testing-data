  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function and `object.inspect()` is a function call, which would return the result of the function instead of the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.call()` is a function call that would return the result of the function, but it would also change the value of `this` inside the function to `object.inspect`, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.bind()` is a function that would return a new function with the value of `this` bound to `object.inspect`, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
