  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part would be inverted, causing the resulting complex number to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part would be multiplied by a random value, causing the resulting complex number to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '/' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part would be divided by a random value, causing the resulting complex number to be different.

DONE.
