  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allResolved" is a different method than "allSettled" and would not provide the same functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because "any" is a different method than "allSettled" and would not provide the same functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because "all" is a different method than "allSettled" and would not provide the same functionality.

DONE.
