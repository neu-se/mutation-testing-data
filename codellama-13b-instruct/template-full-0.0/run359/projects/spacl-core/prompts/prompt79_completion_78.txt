  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is called on the `rule` object, which is not the same as the `Policy` object. This could cause the `Policy` object to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called on the `rule` object, which is not the same as the `Policy` object. This could cause the `Policy` object to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called on the `rule` object, which is not the same as the `Policy` object. This could cause the `Policy` object to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
