  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a different method than `set`, and it would cause the code to use the wrong method for setting the property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method than `set`, and it would cause the code to use the wrong method for setting the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different method than `set`, and it would cause the code to use the wrong method for setting the property value.

DONE.
