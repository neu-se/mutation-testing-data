 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event is being replaced with the 'warn' event, which has a different meaning and may not be handled correctly by the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'custom_event'
