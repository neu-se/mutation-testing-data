  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `a === 0 && b > 0` is true when the base is fully imaginary and the exponent is real and positive. In this case, the function would return `Complex['ONE']`, which is not the correct result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `a === 0 && b < 0` is true when the base is fully imaginary and the exponent is real and negative. In this case, the function would return `Complex['ZERO']`, which is not the correct result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `a === 0 && b === 0` is true when the base is fully imaginary and the exponent is real and
