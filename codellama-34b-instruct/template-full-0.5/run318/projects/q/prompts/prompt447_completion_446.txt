  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("failed"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would be handled by the `untrackRejection` function and removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `null`, which would be handled by the `untrackRejection` function and removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return 42; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `42`, which would be handled by the `untrackRejection` function and removed from the `unhandledRejections
