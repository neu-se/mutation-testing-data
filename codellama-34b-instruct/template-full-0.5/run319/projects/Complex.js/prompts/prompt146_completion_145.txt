  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the value is not `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the value is not `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NAN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `NaN`, even if the value is not `NaN`.

DONE.
