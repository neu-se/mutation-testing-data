Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first rule in the `rules` array, potentially leading to incorrect results when checking if a path is governed by the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat(new Rule('dummy', 'deny'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new dummy rule that always denies access, which could change the outcome of the `matches` method unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.isActive)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider active rules, potentially ignoring inactive ones that might still govern the path, leading to incorrect access control decisions.

DONE.
