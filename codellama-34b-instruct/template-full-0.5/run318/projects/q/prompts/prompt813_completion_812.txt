  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method of the `Q` function, not the `Promise` prototype, and it would throw an error if called on a `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method of the `Promise` prototype, and it would return a new promise that resolves to `null` when the original promise is fulfilled, rather than throwing an error immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method of the `Promise` prototype, and it would return a new promise that rejects with an error when the original promise is fulfilled, rather than throwing an error immediately.

DONE.
