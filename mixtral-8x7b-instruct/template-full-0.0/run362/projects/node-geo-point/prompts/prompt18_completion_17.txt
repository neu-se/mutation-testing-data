 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check for null values, unlike the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(object) !== '[object Object]'
