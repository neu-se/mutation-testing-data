  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the URL, ignoring any subdirectories or query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("?")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the URL before the query parameters, ignoring any subdirectories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("#")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the URL before the fragment identifier, ignoring any subdirectories or query parameters.

DONE.
