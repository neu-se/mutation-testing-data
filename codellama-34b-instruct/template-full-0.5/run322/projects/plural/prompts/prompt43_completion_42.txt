  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would return "nucleus" instead of "nuclei" for the word "nucleus".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would return "nucleuses" instead of "nuclei" for the word "nucleus".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would return "nucleuses" instead of "nuclei" for the word "nucleus".

DONE.
