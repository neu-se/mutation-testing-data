Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the original rule without cloning it, meaning any changes to the cloned policy will affect the original rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces each rule with `null`, effectively creating a policy with no valid rules, which would lead to unexpected results when querying the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => ({ ...rule, modified: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the rule with an additional property `modified` set to `true`, which could alter the behavior of the rules if they rely on the presence or absence of that property.

DONE.
