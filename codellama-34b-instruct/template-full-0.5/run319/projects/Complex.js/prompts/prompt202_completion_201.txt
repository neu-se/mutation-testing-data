  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the arguments passed to the `Complex` constructor, which could cause the resulting complex number to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `z['re']` to `a` before passing it to the `Complex` constructor, which could cause the resulting complex number to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by `z['re']` before passing it to the `Complex` constructor, which could cause the resulting complex number to be different.

DONE.
