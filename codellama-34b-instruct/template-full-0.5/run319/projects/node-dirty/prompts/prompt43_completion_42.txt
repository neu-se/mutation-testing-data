  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the key instead of the key itself, which could cause the `forEach` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the key plus one instead of the key itself, which could cause the `forEach` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the key plus one instead of the key itself, which could cause the `forEach` method to behave differently.

DONE.
