  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value to the same value, effectively making the cache a no-op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value to the same key, effectively making the cache a no-op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value to one more than the original value, effectively changing the behavior of the cache.

DONE.
