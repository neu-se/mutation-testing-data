 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function would be immediately called with the `value` as an argument, instead of waiting for the promise to fulfill.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called with any argument, instead of receiving the exception as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => rejected('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error message would be passed to the `rejected` function, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

DONE.
