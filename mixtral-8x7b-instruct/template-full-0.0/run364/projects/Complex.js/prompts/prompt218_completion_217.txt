 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.acos (arc cosine) returns the angle in radians for which the cosine is the given value, while Math.cos (cosine) returns the cosine of a given angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.sin (sine) returns the sine of a given angle, while Math.cos (cosine) returns the cosine of a given angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the function call with a constant value would always return the same result, regardless of the input, while the original code fragment (Math.cos) calculates the cosine of the input.

DONE.
