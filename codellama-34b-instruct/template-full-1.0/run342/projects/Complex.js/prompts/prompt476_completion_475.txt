  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isFinite` checks if the value is a finite number. In the context of the code, `isNaN` would return `true` for any number that is not a finite number, which would cause the `isInfinite` flag to be set incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the number is not a finite number, rather than the imaginary part. In the context of the code, this would cause the `isInfinite` flag to be set correctly for some numbers that it should not be set for.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math['abs'](b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the absolute value of the imaginary part of the number is not a finite number, rather
