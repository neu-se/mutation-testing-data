  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the case of the target file path, which could cause the archive to be written to a different location than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'extra' to the target file path, which could cause the archive to be written to a different location than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/tmp/' + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the target file path to a different directory, which could cause the archive to be written to a different location than expected.

DONE.
