  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map function to receive a null value as the second argument, which may not be intended and could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map function to receive an undefined value as the second argument, which may not be intended and could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map function to receive a null value as the first argument, which may not be intended and could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
