 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = i + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the assignment operator instead of the pre-increment operator, which may affect the loop behavior in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it simply evaluates the expression without changing the value of `i`, which could lead to skipping an iteration in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
++i;
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the pre-increment operator on the wrong variable `i` instead of the intended loop variable, which could lead to unexpected loop behavior or infinite loops in the `parse` function.

DONE.
