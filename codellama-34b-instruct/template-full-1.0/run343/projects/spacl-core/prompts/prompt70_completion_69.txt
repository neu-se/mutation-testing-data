  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `path`, which could potentially change the evaluation of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `path` by 0, which would result in the equation always being false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `path` to itself, which could potentially change the evaluation of the `if` statement.

DONE.
