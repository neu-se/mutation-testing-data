  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `predicate` function, causing the `filter` method to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index + 1` argument passed to the `predicate` function would cause it to evaluate the next element in the array, rather than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `index % 2 === 0` would cause the `filter` method to only return elements that are at even indices in the array, rather than all elements that satisfy the `predicate` function.
