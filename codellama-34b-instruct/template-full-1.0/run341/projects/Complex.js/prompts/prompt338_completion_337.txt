  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting function would return the wrong imaginary part for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting function would return the wrong real part for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting function would return a complex number with a different real part and imaginary part than the original code fragment.

DONE.
