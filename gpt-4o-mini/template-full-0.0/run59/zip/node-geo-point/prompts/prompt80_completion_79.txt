Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of the longitude instead of converting it from degrees to radians, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude instead of the longitude for the conversion to radians, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitude by 2 instead of converting it to radians, which would significantly distort the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
