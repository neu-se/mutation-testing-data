  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "http://" protocol to the URL if it is missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "https://" protocol to the URL if it is missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http://" or "https://" protocol from the URL if it is present.

DONE.
