  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise, while the replaced code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise, while the replaced code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise, while the replaced code fragment returns a rejected promise with an error message.

DONE.
