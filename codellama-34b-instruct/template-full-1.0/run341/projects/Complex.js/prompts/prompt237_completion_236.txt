  Sure, here are three options with different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of its argument, while `a * b` returns the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of its argument, while `a * b` returns the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of its argument, while `a * b` returns the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
