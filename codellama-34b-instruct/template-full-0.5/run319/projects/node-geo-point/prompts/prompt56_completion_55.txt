  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and `sin(θ)` would produce a different value than `cos(θ)` for the same angle `θ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a trigonometric function that produces a different value than `cos` for the same angle `θ`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse of `cos`, and `acos(x)` would produce a different value than `cos(x)` for the same value `x`.

DONE.
