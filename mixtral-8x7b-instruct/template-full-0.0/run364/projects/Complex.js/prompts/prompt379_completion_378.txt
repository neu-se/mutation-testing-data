 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine function is replaced with the sine function, which calculates the ratio of the length of the side of a right triangle opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse, rather than the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the hyperbolic cosine function is used instead of the regular cosine function. The hyperbolic cosine function calculates the ratio of the length of the adjacent side of a hyperbolic triangle to the length of the hypotenuse, rather than the ratio of the length of the adjacent side of a regular triangle to the length of the hypotenuse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponential function is used
