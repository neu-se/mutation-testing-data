Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to assign `end` to the logical AND of `end` and `abort`, which means `end` will only be truthy if both `end` and `abort` are truthy, potentially leading to unexpected results when `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets `end` to `null`, disregarding the value of `abort`, which could lead to the `done` callback being called with `null` instead of the intended value, affecting error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `end` to `true`, which would cause the `done` callback to be invoked with `null` instead of the actual error or abort value, potentially masking errors in the stream processing.

DONE.
