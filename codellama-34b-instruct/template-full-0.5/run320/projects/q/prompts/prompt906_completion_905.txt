  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the callback was undefined, while this replacement checks if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not check if the callback was a function, while this replacement checks if it is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not check the length of the callback, while this replacement checks if the callback has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
