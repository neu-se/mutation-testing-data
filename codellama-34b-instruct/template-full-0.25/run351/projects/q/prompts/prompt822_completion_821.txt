  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `object` argument to the `done` method, while the modified code fragment would pass `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `object` argument to the `done` method, while the modified code fragment would pass `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `object` argument to the `done` method, while the modified code fragment would pass the string `"foo"`.

DONE.
