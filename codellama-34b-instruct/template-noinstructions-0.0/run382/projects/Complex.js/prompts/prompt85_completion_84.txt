  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = /* void */
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `z['im'] = 0`, which would set the imaginary part of the complex number to 0, while the new code fragment would leave the imaginary part unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `z['im'] = 0`, which would set the imaginary part of the complex number to 0, while the new code fragment would set the imaginary part to NaN (Not a Number).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `z['im'] = 0`, which would set the imaginary part of the complex number to 0, while the new code fragment would set the imaginary part to Infinity.

DONE
