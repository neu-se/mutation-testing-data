  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `Q.onerror` function from being called, which could cause unhandled exceptions to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Unhandled exception"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error whenever an unhandled exception occurs, which could cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Unhandled exception"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console whenever an unhandled exception occurs, which could help with debugging but would not prevent the program from continuing to run.

DONE.
