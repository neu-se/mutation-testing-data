  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL protocol would be different, and the request would be sent over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL protocol would be different, and the request would be sent over FTP instead of HTTPS.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'htt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL protocol would be different, and the request would be sent over a different protocol than HTTPS.

DONE.
