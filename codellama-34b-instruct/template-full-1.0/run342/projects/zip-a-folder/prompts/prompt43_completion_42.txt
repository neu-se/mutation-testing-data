  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be treated as a glob pattern, which would match any file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be treated as a glob pattern, which would match any file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^globPart$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any file that contains the string "globPart".

DONE.
