  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new op `newOp` to the `delta` object, which could cause the `compose` method to behave differently and potentially produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `thisIter` iterator to the next op, which could cause the `compose` method to behave differently and potentially produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator to the next op, which could cause the `compose` method to behave differently and potentially produce a different output.

DONE.
