  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `str` variable, which is used in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `str` variable, which is used in the function.

DONE.
