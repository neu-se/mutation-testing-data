  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this replacement checks if `value` is null. If `value` is null, the original code would execute the `if` block, while this replacement would execute the `else` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this replacement checks if `value` is strictly equal to null. If `value` is null, the original code would execute the `if` block, while this replacement would execute the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this replacement checks if `value` is not strictly equal to null. If `value` is null, the original code would execute the `if
