 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'String'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the type of the rule[1] to the string 'String', instead of comparing it to the actual constructor function `String`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the constructor of the regex pattern instead of the regex pattern itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[1].toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the function to a string, and then compare the string representation of the function to 'Function', which would never be equal.

DONE.
