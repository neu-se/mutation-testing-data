Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `delta` object without calling the `chop()` method, potentially leaving the `delta` in an unprocessed state, which could lead to incorrect results in subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always chop the `delta` to a length of 1, regardless of the actual content of `delta`, which could lead to loss of data and incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively return an empty `delta` object, as chopping with a length of 0 would remove all operations, leading to a loss of all transformation data.

DONE.
