  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because 'value.then()' would force the 
promise chain to resolve, resulting in a different computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because 'value.catch()' would catch and 
handle any errors that may occur in the promise chain, resulting in a different 
computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because 'value.finally()' would run the 
given callback when the promise is settled, regardless of whether it was 
resolved or rejected, resulting in a different computation.

DONE.
