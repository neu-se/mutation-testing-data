  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because  `!isPromiseAlike(value)` is a negation of the original code fragment, which would result in the `else` block being executed instead of the `if` block, potentially causing a different branch of logic to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because  `isPromise(value)` is a different function from `isPromiseAlike(value)` and may return a different value for the same input, potentially causing a different branch of logic to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because  `value instanceof Promise` is a different instanceof check from `isPromiseAlike(value)` and may return a different value for the same input, potentially causing a different branch of logic to be executed.
