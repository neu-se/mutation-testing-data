  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which would cause the code to store the value at the wrong key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be converted to uppercase, which would cause the code to store the value at the wrong key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be reversed, which would cause the code to store the value at the wrong key in the map.

DONE.
