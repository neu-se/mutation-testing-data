  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `any([])` is a rejected promise, whereas `this` in the context of a promise's `then()` method refers to the promise itself, which would be fulfilled with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is the value `undefined`, whereas `this` in the context of a promise's `then()` method refers to the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a fulfilled promise with the value `1`, whereas `this` in the context of a promise's `then()` method refers to the promise itself, which would be fulfilled with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
