  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the type of operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the type of operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any object value.

DONE.
