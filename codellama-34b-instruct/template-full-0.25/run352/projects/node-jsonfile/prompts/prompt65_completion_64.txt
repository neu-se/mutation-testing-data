  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different. The original code uses the `^` anchor to match the beginning of the string, while the mutated code uses the `\uFEFF` character class to match the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different. The original code uses an empty string as the replacement, while the mutated code uses a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different. The original code uses an empty string as the replacement, while the mutated code uses the string "foo".

DONE.
