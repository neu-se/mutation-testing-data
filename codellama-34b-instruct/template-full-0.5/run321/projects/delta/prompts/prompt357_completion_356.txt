  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an exact match of `arg`, while this modified code fragment would look for a match of `arg + 1`, which would not be found in the same location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an exact match of `arg`, while this modified code fragment would look for a match of `arg * 2`, which would not be found in the same location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an exact match of `arg`, while this modified code fragment would look for a match of `arg - 1`, which would not be found in the same location.

DONE.
