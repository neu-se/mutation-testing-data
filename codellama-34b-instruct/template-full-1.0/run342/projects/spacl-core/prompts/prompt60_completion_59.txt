  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise + 'this-is-an-extra-string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra string would be added to the resulting regex, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would be converted to lowercase, which would cause it to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first character of the regex would be removed, which would cause it to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
