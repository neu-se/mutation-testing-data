  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the absolute value of `a`, while the replaced code fragment is using the negative value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `a` as is, while the replaced code fragment is adding 1 to the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `a` as is, while the replaced code fragment is multiplying `a` by 2.

DONE.
