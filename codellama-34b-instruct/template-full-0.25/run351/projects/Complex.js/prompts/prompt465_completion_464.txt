  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would cause the imaginary part of the complex number to be negated, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be incremented by 1, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be doubled, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
