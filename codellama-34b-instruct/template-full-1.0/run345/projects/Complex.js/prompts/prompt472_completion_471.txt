  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN(this['re'])` is always false when `this['re']` is `NaN`, but `isNaN` returns true when `this['re']` is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] < 0` is always false when `this['re']` is `NaN`, but `isNaN` returns true when `this['re']` is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] != this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] != this['re']` is always false when `this['re']` is `NaN`, but `isNaN` returns true when `this['re']` is `NaN`.

DONE.
