  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `retain` property `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property to `undefined` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property to an empty object instead of the expected object.

DONE.
