  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `MessageChannel` is defined, while the new code fragment checks if it is not defined. This would cause the code to take the `else` branch, which uses `setTimeout` instead of `MessageChannel`, even if `MessageChannel` is supported.

DONE.
