  Sure, here are three potential mutations for the PLACEHOLDER:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get(null)` would return null, which is not the same as `this.get(name)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get(undefined)` would return undefined, which is not the same as `this.get(name)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get("other_name")
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get("other_name")` would return a different policy than `this.get(name)`.

DONE.
