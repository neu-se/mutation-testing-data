  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of strings, rather than a single string, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.replace("\n", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove all newline characters from the string, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.substring(0, concatedStacks.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring of the original string, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail.

DONE.
