  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile.replace(/\W/g, '\\$&')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape all non-word characters in the path specification, including forward slashes, which would cause the matcher to match paths that were not intended to be matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile.replace(/:(\w+)/g, '($1)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all named captures with numbered captures, which would cause the order of the captures to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile.replace(/[\/()]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes and parentheses, which would cause the matcher to match paths that were not intended to be matched.

DONE.
