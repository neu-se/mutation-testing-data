 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the stack trace to a string, losing the ability to filter out unwanted frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `promise.stack` property, which might not exist or contain the desired information in different environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it joins the stack traces with a newline character, but without the separator, which makes it harder to distinguish between the original and the added stack traces.

DONE.
