  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `mapper && mapper`

This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has lower precedence than the `!` operator, so `mapper && mapper` is equivalent to `(mapper && mapper) != null`. In the original code, `!mapper` is equivalent to `mapper != null`, so this change would cause the function to behave differently when `mapper` is a function that returns a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `mapper || mapper`

This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `!` operator, so `mapper || mapper` is equivalent to `(mapper || mapper) != null`. In the original code, `!mapper` is equivalent to `mapper != null`, so this change would cause the function to behave differently when `mapper` is a function that returns a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `!mapper(
