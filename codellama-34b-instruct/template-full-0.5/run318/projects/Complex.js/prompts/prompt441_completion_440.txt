  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the multiplication, which would change the final result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the result of the multiplication, which would change the final result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 from the result of the multiplication, which would change the final result of the calculation.

DONE.
