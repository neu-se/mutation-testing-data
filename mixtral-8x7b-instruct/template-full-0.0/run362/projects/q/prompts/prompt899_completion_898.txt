 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, not a function, and `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function. This change would cause the `fail` method to be called with an object instead of a function, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function. This change would cause the `fail` method to be called with `null` instead of a function, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that resolves the promise. This change would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, instead of waiting
