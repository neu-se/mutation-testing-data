  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different object, which may cause the `extract` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different object, which may cause the `extract` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different object, which may cause the `extract` function to behave differently.

DONE.
