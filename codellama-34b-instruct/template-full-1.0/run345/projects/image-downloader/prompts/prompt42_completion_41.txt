  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` would throw a generic error, whereas `new TimeoutError()` would throw a more specific `TimeoutError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Request Failed.')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error('Request Failed.')` would throw a generic error with the message "Request Failed.", while `new TimeoutError()` would throw a more specific `TimeoutError` with a default message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(res.statusMessage)
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error(res.statusMessage)` would throw a generic error with the status message of the response, while `new TimeoutError()` would throw a more specific `TimeoutError` with the default message.

DONE.
