  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the item to the array, while the modified code fragment pushes the item to the array and then returns the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift(item)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the item to the array, while the modified code fragment unshifts the item to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.concat(item)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the item to the array, while the modified code fragment concatenates the item to the array.

DONE.
