  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, which means that the BOM (Byte Order Mark) will not be removed from the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim` method is being called on the data, which means that any whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the data will be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '').toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method is being called on the data, which means that all characters in the data will be converted to lowercase.

DONE.
