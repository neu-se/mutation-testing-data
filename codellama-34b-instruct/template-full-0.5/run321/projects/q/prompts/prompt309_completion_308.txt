  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different function than `reject`, and would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise, and would cause the promise to reject with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with a different reason, instead of returning a resolved promise.

DONE.
