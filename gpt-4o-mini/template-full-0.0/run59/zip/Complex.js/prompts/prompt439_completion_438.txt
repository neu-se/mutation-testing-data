Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from multiplication to division, which will yield a different result when calculating the ceiling of the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from multiplication to addition, which will produce a significantly different value when calculating the ceiling of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the imaginary part instead of the real part, leading to an incorrect calculation when attempting to ceil the real component of the complex number.

DONE.
