  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `b[key]` to `b[key]`, which is always true, even if the values are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `a[key]` to `b[key] + 1`, which is always different, even if the values are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `a[key]` to `b[key] * 2`, which is always different, even if the values are the same.

DONE.
