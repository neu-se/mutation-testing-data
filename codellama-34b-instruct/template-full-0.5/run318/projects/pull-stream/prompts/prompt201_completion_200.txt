  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function instead of passing it as an argument to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `read` function instead of the `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to the `read` function instead of the `abort` argument.

DONE.
