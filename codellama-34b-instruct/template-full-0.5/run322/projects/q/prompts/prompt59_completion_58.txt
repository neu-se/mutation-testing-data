  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object in browsers, but it may not be defined in other environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object in browsers, but it may not be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object in browsers, but it may not be a function.

DONE.
