  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the slice of the `arguments` array in-place, whereas the original code created a new array by calling `array_slice(arguments)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `nodeArgs` argument with `undefined`, which would cause an error when trying to call the `push` method on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new, shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code modified the original array in-place.

DONE.
