 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the 're' property of 'z' with Infinity, instead of checking if either 'z' or the current complex number is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'z' is infinite using the 'isInfinite' method, but the original code checks if either 'z' or the current complex number is Infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the result of the subtraction with Infinity, instead of checking if either 'z' or the current complex number is Infinite.

DONE.
