  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the message payload in the postMessage() call, which could affect the behavior of the code that handles the message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the message payload in the postMessage() call, which could affect the behavior of the code that handles the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the message payload in the postMessage() call, which could affect the behavior of the code that handles the message.

DONE.
