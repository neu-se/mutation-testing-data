  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `read` function, while the new code fragment is a null value. This would cause the `pull` function to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to call the `read` function as a constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `read` function, while the new code fragment is an undefined value. This would cause the `pull` function to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to call the `read` function as a constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `read` function, while the new code fragment is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. This would cause the `pull` function to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to call
