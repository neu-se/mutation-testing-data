  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stack.substr(0, 500)
```
This would result in different behavior because it truncates the stack trace to only the first 500 characters, which may not include the entire stack trace of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stack.replace("[object Object]", "Object")
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of "[object Object]" with "Object", which may not be desirable for certain error messages.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stack.split("\n").slice(0, 3).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it only includes the first 3 lines of the stack trace, which may not include the entire stack trace of the error.

DONE.
