  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a tuple containing the error and the promise, while the buggy code fragment returns a tuple containing the error and the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a tuple containing the error and the promise, while the buggy code fragment returns only the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a tuple containing the error and the promise, while the buggy code fragment returns only the promise.

DONE.
