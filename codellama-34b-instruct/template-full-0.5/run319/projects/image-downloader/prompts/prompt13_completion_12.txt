  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` is a different function than `decodeURIComponent` and would produce a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` is the opposite of `decodeURIComponent` and would produce a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the decoded basename to lowercase, which could potentially change the output of the program.

DONE.
