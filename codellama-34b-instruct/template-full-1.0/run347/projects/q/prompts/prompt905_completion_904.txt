  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(timeoutId);
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeoutId` is an integer, but the `nodeArgs` array expects a function as its last element. This would result in the error `TypeError: nodeArgs.concat is not a function`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[timeoutId];
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeoutId` is an integer, not a function. This would result in the error `TypeError: nodeArgs[timeoutId] is undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs` is an array, not a function, and `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function. This would result in the error `TypeError: nodeArgs.push is not a function`.

DONE.
