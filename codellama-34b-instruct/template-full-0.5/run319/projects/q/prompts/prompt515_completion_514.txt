  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method is used instead of `deferred.reject()`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of notified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as the reason for the notification, which would cause the promise to be notified with a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(new Error('Notify'));
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Error` object is passed as the reason for the notification, which would cause the promise to be notified with a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
