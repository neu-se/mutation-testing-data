 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` value is being flipped, causing the `transform` method to behave differently when handling embed types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler['transform'](thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because using bracket notation to access the `transform` method can lead to issues if the `handler` object doesn't have a `transform` property or if it's not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is being called instead of the `transform` method, causing the embed types to be inverted instead of transformed.

DONE.
