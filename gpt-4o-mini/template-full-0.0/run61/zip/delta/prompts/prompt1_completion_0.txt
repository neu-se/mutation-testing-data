Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow an empty object or any object to be treated as invalid, leading to `a` being reset to an empty object even when it is a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat both `null` and `undefined` as valid cases to reset `a`, which is broader than the original check and could lead to unintended loss of data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reset `a` if it is an array, thus allowing non-array objects to pass through and potentially leading to incorrect handling of the `compose` function when `a` is a valid object but not an array.

DONE.
