  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, it checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while in the new code, it only checks if `z` is infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex.INFINITY` when both `this` and `z` are infinite, even if `this` is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, it checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while in the new code, it checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex.INFINITY` when either `this` or `z` is infinite, even if `this` is not zero.
