  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the value of `options.dest`, which would cause the `path.join` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of `options.dest` to uppercase, which would cause the `path.join` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the value of `options.dest` by '/' and return the last element of the resulting array, which would cause the `path.join` function to return a different result.

DONE.
