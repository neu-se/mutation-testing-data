  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.retain, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum up the `retain` property of each op, instead of the `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.delete, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum up the `delete` property of each op, instead of the `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.insert, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum up the `insert` property of each op, instead of the `length` property.

DONE.
