  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, while the `!==` operator checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for loose equality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x >= y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator checks for greater than or equal to, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality.

DONE.
