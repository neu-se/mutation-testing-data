  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping operations that should be included in the diff.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation in the other delta, potentially skipping operations that should be included in the diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return null, indicating that there are no more operations to process, potentially causing the diff algorithm to terminate prematurely.

DONE.
