 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'person'.replace('e', 'a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return 'persons' instead of 'people'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append 'es' to the input word, regardless of the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append 'i' to the input word, regardless of the last character.

DONE.
