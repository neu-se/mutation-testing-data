Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" && typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `window` and `self` are undefined, which would lead to the code block being executed in environments where either one of them is defined, contrary to the original logic that requires at least one to be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof document !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `document` instead of `window` or `self`, which may be true in certain environments (like a web worker) where `document` is not available, leading to unexpected execution of the code block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `global`, which is typically defined in Node.js environments but not in browser environments, potentially causing the code block to execute in Node.js but not in browsers, contrary to the original intent.

DONE.
