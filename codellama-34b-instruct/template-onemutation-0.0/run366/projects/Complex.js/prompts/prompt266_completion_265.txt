  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which expects the arguments to be in the order of (y, x), while the replaced code fragment uses the arguments in the order of (x, y). This would cause the resulting angle to be different, leading to different behavior in the `log` function.

DONE.
