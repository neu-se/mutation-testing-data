  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would trigger the errback function and cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Test Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would trigger the errback function and cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("Test Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an error, which would trigger the callback function and cause the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
