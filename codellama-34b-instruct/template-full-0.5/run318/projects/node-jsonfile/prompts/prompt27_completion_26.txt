  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because `replacer` is a different option than `reviver`, and it may not be passed to `JSON.parse()` in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `encoding` is a different option than `reviver`, and it may not be passed to `JSON.parse()` in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `reviver` option, and it may cause `JSON.parse()` to throw an error.

DONE.
