  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, [value, index, self])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array as its second argument, whereas `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(thisp, value, index, self)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that, when called, will call the original function with the specified `this` value and arguments, whereas `call` calls the function immediately with the specified arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with the correct arguments, but without the correct `this` value.

DONE.
