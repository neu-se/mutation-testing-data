Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a `null` value instead of passing the `end` error, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `end` value directly to the callback, which may not be an error and could lead to unexpected results in the handling of the stream's end condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a string `'error'` instead of the actual `end` value, which could mislead the consumer of the function into thinking an error occurred when it may not have.

DONE.
