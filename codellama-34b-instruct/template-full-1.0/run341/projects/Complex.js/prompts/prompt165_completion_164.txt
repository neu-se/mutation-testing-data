  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is a finite value, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite. Replacing `isInfinite` with `isFinite` would cause the code to always return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the exponent is infinite, even if the base is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would invert the result of the `isInfinite` check. Therefore, if the exponent was infinite, the code would return `Complex['NAN']` instead of `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isInfinite'] && this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `Complex['INF
