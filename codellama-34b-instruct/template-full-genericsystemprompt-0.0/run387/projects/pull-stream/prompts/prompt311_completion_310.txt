  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, which is the data that is being read from the stream. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `test` function to receive `null` as its argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, which is the data that is being read from the stream. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `test` function to receive `undefined` as its argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"data"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function
