  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes both "http://" and "https://" from the beginning of the URL, while this replacement only removes "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes both "http://" and "https://" from the beginning of the URL, while this replacement replaces them with "ftp://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'file://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes both "http://" and "https://" from the beginning of the URL, while this replacement replaces them with "file://".

DONE.
