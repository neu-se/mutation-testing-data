  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of the `errback` function, which could be a different value than what the `callback` function returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of the `reject` function, which could be a different value than what the `callback` function returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nothing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`, which could be a different value than what the `callback` function returns.

DONE.
