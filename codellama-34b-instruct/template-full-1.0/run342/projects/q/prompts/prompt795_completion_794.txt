  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN !== void 0` and would cause the callback to be called even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null !== void 0` and would cause the callback to be called even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined !== void 0` and would cause the callback to be called even if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
