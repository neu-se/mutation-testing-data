  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arc cosine of a number, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a * b)` returns the square root of the product of `a` and `b`, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a single number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max(a, b)` returns the greater of the two numbers `a` and `b`, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a single number.

DONE.
