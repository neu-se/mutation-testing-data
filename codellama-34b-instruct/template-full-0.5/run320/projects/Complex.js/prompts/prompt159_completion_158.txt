  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not a valid argument for the `isZero` method, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is not a valid argument for the `isZero` method, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
