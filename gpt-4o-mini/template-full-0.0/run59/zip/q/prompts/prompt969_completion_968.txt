Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` is designed to call a method on an object with a given name and arguments, while `npost` is intended to call a method of a Node-style object that accepts a Node-style callback, potentially leading to different handling of the callback and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is meant to apply a function with the provided arguments and a Node-style callback, whereas `npost` is specifically for calling a method on an object, which may not align with the intended use of `args` in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is used to apply a function with the provided arguments but does not handle Node-style callbacks, which could lead to unhandled errors or unexpected results when the method being called expects a callback.

DONE.
