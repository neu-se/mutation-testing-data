  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not present in the URL, while this new code fragment would always replace the protocol with "https://", potentially changing the URL's protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not present in the URL, while this new code fragment would always replace the protocol with "ftp://", potentially changing the URL's protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'file://')
```
This would result in different behavior because
