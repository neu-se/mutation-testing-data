  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if they are identical (i.e., have the same value and type).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length != pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if the lengths of the domains are not equal.

DONE.
