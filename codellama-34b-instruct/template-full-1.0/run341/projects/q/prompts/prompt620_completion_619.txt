  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method is not defined and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q[object].dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q[object]` would be undefined and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is not a promise and does not have a `dispatch` method.

DONE.
