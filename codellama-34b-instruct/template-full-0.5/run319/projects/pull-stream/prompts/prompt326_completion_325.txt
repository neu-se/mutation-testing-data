  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called without any arguments, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function is called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
