  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is truthy. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the `stream` variable is not an object but still has a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && typeof stream === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is truthy and has a type of "object". This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the `stream` variable is not an object but still has a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && stream.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
