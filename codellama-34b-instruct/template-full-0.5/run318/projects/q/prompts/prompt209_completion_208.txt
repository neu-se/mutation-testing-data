  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a promise object, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object that has already been resolved, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
