  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.isResolved` is a function that checks whether a promise is resolved or not, whereas `Q` is a function that creates a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise with a specified value, whereas `Q` is a function that creates a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise with a specified reason, whereas `Q` is a function that creates a new promise.

DONE.
