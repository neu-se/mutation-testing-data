 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(object)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the first key of the object instead of checking if a specific key exists in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, '<some_key>')
