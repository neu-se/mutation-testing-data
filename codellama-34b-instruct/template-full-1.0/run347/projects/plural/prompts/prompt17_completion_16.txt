  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push([match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `rules.unshift([match, result])` which adds the new rule to the start of the list, but this new code would add the rule to the end of the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\w+\b/i, function(w){return w + 'es'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a regular expression to match the rule, but this new code uses a constant string that would not match any rule.

Option 3:The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.rog/i, function(w){return w + 's'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a regular expression to match the rule, but this new code uses a different regular expression that would not match any rule.

DONE.
