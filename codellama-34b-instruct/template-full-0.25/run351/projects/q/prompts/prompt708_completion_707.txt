  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which includes the first argument in the slice, while this replacement does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which includes all arguments after the first one, while this replacement only includes the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which includes all arguments after the first one, while this replacement only includes the second argument.

DONE.
