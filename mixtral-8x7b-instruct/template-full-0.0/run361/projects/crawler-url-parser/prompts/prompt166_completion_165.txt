 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part_count_diff === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a difference of exactly 2 in the part count, instead of 1 or more.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the linkurl\_path is a prefix of pageurl\_path, instead of checking if pageurl\_path includes linkurl\_path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_subdomain_len > pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if linkurl\_subdomain\_len is greater than pageurl\_subdomain\_len, instead of checking if linkurl\_domain is equal to pageurl\_domain.

DONE.
