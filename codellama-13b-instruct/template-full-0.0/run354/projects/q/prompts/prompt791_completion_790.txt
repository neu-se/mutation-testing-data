  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called immediately, causing the promise to be rejected with the error message "Q can't apply finally callback".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would be evaluated to `undefined`, causing the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be evaluated to `null`, causing the promise to be resolved with the value `null`.

DONE.
