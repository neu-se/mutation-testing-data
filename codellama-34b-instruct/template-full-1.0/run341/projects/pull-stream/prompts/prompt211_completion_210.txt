  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different variable name from the original code.
Note: I'm assuming that 'aborted' is a variable name in the original code, not a literal string.

Option 2:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a null value to the callback, rather than the actual error object.

Option 3:
```
new Error('Aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a new Error object to the callback, rather than the actual error object.
DONE.
