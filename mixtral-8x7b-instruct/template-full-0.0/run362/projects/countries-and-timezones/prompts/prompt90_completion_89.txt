 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with a specific timezone name, causing the `getCountryForTimezone` function to always return the same country object for that timezone, regardless of the provided `tzName`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.tzName

This could lead to unexpected results if the `options` object does not have the `tzName` property or if it has a different value than the actual timezone name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 0 and 1, causing the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return a random country object for any given timezone. This would make the function's
