  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` is a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value that is determined by the value of the `PLACEHOLDER`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error())` is a rejected promise with a value of `Error`, whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value that is determined by the value of the `PLACEHOLDER`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected later, whereas the original code
