  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of the first `a` element in the document, rather than the value of the `href` attribute of the current element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href', 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `href` attribute of the first `a` element in the document to `http://example.com`, rather than returning the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href', function() {
  return 'http://example.com';
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `href` attribute of the first `a` element in the document to `http://example.com`, rather than returning the value
