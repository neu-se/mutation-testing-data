  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a non-null value, while `null` is a null value. This change would cause the `op` function to receive a different argument, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a defined value, while `undefined` is an undefined value. This change would cause the `op` function to receive a different argument, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a non-zero value, while `0` is a zero value. This change would cause the `op` function to receive a different argument, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
