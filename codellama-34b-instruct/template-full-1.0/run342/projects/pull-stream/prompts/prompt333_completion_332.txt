  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a `null` error instead of the original error to the callback, potentially causing the code that handles errors to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data as the error instead of the original error, potentially causing the code that handles errors to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass two `null` values instead of the original error and data, potentially causing the code that handles errors to fail.

DONE.
