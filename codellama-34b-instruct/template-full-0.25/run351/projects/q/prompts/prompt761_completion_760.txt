  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0, promises.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last promise in the array, which could potentially cause the `allResolved` method to never resolve if that promise is the one that is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first promise in the array, which could potentially cause the `allResolved` method to never resolve if that promise is the one that is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the promises in the array, which could potentially cause the `allResolved` method to never resolve if the order of the promises is important.

DONE.
