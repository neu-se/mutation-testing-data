  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, while the `reverse` method reverses the array in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(["new element"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, while the `concat` method returns a new array with the concatenated elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== "new element" })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, while the `filter` method returns a new array with the filtered elements.

DONE.
