  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chili', 'chiles')
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected output for the word "chili" would be "chilies" instead of "chillies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chili', 'chillis')
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected output for the word "chili" would be "chillis" instead of "chillies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chili', 'spicy peppers')
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected output for the word "chili" would be "spicy peppers" instead of "chillies".

DONE.
