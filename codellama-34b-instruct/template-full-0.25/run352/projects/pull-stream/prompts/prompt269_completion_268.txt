  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, so if `end` is truthy, `!end` will be falsy, and the `return` statement will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will increment the value of `end` by 1, which could cause the `return` statement to be executed even if `end` is not truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator will decrement the value of `end` by 1, which could cause the `return` statement to be executed even if `end` is not truthy.

DONE.
