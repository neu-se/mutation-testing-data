 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` argument is not passed to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which may cause the promise to behave unexpectedly or fail to propagate the correct data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
