  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is called with `null` instead of a function, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed to `Q` instead of the intended function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a function that throws an error would be passed to `Q` instead of the intended function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error.

DONE.
