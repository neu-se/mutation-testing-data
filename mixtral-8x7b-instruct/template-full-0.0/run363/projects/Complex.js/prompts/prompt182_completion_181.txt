 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check if the real part of the second complex number is zero, instead of checking if the imaginary part of the second complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Complex['ONE'] when the second complex number is zero, regardless of the value of the first complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number with a zero imaginary part when the imaginary parts of both complex numbers are zero, regardless of the values of the real parts.

DONE.
