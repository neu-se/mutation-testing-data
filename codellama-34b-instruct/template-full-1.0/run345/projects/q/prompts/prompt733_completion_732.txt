  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to reject, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to reject, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would cause the promise to neither resolve nor reject, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to resolve.

DONE.
