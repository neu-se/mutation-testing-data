  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because when `op.retain` is an object, it would not be executed, while the original code would have executed the code inside the if block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true, as there is no `Object.prototype.toString.call(op.retain)` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be false, as there is no `Object.prototype.toString.call(op.retain)` method.

DONE.
