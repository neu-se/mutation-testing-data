Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because using "return" instead of "throw" would cause the generator to return a value instead of throwing an exception, which would change how errors are handled in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because using "next" would cause the generator to attempt to continue execution with the next value instead of handling an error, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would cause the `continuer` function to not handle any exceptions, leading to a situation where errors thrown in the generator are not caught, resulting in unhandled exceptions.

DONE.
