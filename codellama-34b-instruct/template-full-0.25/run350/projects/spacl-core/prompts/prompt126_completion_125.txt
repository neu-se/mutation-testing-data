  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `ctx` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `ctx` is equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `ctx` is `null`.

DONE.
