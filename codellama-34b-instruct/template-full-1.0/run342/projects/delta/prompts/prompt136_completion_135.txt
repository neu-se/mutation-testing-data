  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length - (elem.insert ? elem.insert : 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is only considered if it is truthy, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length - (elem.insert || 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is coerced to 0 if it is falsy, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length - (elem.insert ?? 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is coerced to 0 if it is nullish, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
