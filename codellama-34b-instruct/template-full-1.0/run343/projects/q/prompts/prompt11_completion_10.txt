  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be called, and the `definition` variable would not be assigned a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a value of `1`, instead of `definition`, which could potentially change the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a value of `null`, which could potentially change the function's behavior.

DONE.
