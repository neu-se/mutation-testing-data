 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` callback would not be called with the `abort` value, and the `onAbort` callback would not be called if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || 'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` callback would always receive the string `'error'` as its argument, regardless of the value of the `abort` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the global `abort` variable, if it exists, rather than the `abort` variable passed as an argument to the function.

DONE.
