  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is the opposite of `cork`, and it would cause the write stream to resume writing data immediately, rather than waiting for the buffer to fill up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => console.error(err));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the data to the write stream, but it would also log any errors that occur to the console, rather than emitting an `error` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, data);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the data for the given key, rather than writing it to the write stream. This would cause the `_flush` method to not write data to the stream, which could result in data being lost or not being written to the file.

DONE.
