  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the string "promise" as an argument, rather than the expected function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with null as an argument, rather than the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with undefined as an argument, rather than the expected function.

DONE.
