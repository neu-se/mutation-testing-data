  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, potentially resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operator, potentially resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, potentially resulting in a different value.

DONE.
