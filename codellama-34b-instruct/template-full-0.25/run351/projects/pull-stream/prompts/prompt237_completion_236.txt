  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `cb(end, data)` is a function call with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(end, data + 1)` is a function call with one argument that is different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(end, data - 1)` is a function call with one argument that is different from the original.

DONE.
