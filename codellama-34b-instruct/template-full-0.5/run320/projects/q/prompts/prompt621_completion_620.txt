  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the "set" method is used to set the value of a property, while in the modified code, the "get" method is used to retrieve the value of a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the "set" method is used to set the value of a property, while in the modified code, the "delete" method is used to delete a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the "set" method is used to set the value of a property, while in the modified code, the "apply" method is used to apply a function to a list of arguments.

DONE.
