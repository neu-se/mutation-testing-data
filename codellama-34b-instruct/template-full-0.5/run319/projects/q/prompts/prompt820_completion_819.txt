  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, 1+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1+1` expression would be evaluated and passed as an additional argument to the `done` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay(1000)` expression would create a promise that resolves after 1 second, and would pass that promise as an additional argument to the `done` method, which would likely cause the promise to be resolved after 1 second instead of immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject("error")` expression would create a rejected promise with the message "error", and would pass that promise as an additional argument
