  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `Map` object does not have a matching key for the current URL, it would throw a `NullPointerException` when trying to access the `url` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `Map` object does not have a matching key for the current URL, it would return `undefined` when trying to access the `url` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `Map` object does not have a matching key for the current URL, it would return an empty string when trying to access the `url` property of an empty string.

DONE.
