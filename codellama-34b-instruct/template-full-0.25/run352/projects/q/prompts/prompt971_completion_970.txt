  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, but `null` is not an array and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, but `undefined` is not an array and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, but an empty array would not contain the expected arguments and would cause an error.

DONE.
