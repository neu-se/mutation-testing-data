  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `regardless` instead of the original value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined` instead of the original value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `null` instead of the original value of the promise.

DONE.
