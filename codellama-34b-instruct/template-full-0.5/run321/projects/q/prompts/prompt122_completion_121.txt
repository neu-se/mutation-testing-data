  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would throw a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over the `null` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would throw a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over the `undefined` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an empty array when trying to iterate over an empty object.

DONE.
