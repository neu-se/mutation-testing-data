  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next value in the iterator, but does not remove it from the iterator. Calling `peek` twice in a row would return the same value twice, rather than returning the next value and then the current value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next value in the iterator and removes it from the iterator. Calling `next` twice in a row would return the current value and the next value, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method returns `true` if there are more values in the iterator and `false` otherwise. Calling `hasNext` twice in a row would return the same value twice,
