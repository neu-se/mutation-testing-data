  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) - 1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would cause the result of the calculation to be inverted, potentially leading to incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) * 2 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the result of the calculation to be doubled, potentially leading to incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different
