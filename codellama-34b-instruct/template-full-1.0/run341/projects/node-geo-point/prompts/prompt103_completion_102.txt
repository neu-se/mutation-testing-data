  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant offset of 5 would be added to the calculated longitude value, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant offset of 5 would be subtracted from the calculated longitude value, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated longitude value would be multiplied by 5, resulting in a different destination point.

DONE.
