  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fcall` method to behave the same as the `fapply` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fcall` method to ignore the first argument passed to it, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fcall` method to ignore the first three arguments passed to it, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
