  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not` is a different function than `tester`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(test)` is a different function call than `tester(test)`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(data)` is a different function call than `tester(test)`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

DONE.
