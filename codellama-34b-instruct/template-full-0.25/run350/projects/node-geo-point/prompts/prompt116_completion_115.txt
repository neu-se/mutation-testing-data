  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(distance, bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new GeoPoint object with the distance and bearing values as the latitude and longitude, instead of calculating the destination point based on the current point and the distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(distance + this.latitude, bearing + this.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new GeoPoint object with the sum of the distance and latitude, and the sum of the bearing and longitude, instead of calculating the destination point based on the current point and the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(distance * this.latitude, bearing * this.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new GeoPoint object with the product of the distance and latitude, and the product of the bearing and longitude, instead of
