Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete a property using an array instead of a single key, which would not work as intended and could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the key by appending "1" to it, which means it would attempt to delete a different property than originally intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the key would not specify a valid property to delete, leading to no action being taken and potentially causing confusion in the code's logic.

DONE.
