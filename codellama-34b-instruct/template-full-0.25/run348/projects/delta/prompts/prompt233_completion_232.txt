  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `otherIter` object to determine the length of the operation, rather than the `thisIter` object used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum of the `otherIter` and `length` values to determine the length of the operation, rather than the minimum used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.abs(otherIter.peekLength() - length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the absolute difference between the `otherIter` and `length` values to determine the length of the operation, rather than the minimum used in the original code.

DONE.
