  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are not properly checking for the correct behavior when the input is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a plural form of "memo" that ends with "s", while the new code fragment has a plural form of "memo" that ends with "es". This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are not properly checking for the correct behavior when the input has a plural form that ends with "es".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a plural form of "memo
