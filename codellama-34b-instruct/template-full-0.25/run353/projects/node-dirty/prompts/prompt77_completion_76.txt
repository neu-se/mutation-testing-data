  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a different number of loaded keys, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a negative number of loaded keys, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a non-numeric value, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
