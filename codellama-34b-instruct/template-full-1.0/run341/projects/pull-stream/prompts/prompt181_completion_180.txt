  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a callback function that is called when the abort event occurs, while `onAbort()` is a function call that may have side effects and can alter the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(null, array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.bind(null, array)` creates a new function that is bound to the `array` argument and may have different side effects than the original `onAbort` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the `array` object, while `onAbort` is a callback function that may have different side effects and behavior.

DONE.
