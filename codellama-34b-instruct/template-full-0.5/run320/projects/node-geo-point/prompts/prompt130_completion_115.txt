  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null is not a valid GeoPoint object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but {} is not a valid GeoPoint object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Object()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but new Object() is not a valid GeoPoint object.

DONE.
