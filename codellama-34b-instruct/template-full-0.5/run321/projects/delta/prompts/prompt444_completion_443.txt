  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset, length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `next` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1, length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `substr` method to start at a different index, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `next` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset, length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `next` method.

DONE.
