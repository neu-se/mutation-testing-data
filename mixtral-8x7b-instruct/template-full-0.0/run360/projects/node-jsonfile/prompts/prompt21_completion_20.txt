 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, 'bad_options'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would always use a string as the `options` parameter, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the `stringify` and `fs.readFileSync` calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, { fs: _fs }
