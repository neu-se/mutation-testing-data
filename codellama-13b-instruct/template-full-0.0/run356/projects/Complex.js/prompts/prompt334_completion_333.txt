  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, depending on the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, depending on the values of `a` and `b`.
