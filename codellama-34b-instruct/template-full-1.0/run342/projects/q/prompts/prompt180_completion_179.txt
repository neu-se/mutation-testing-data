  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the presence of "node.js" in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(firefox:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the presence of "firefox" in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(chrome:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the presence of "chrome" in the stack trace.

DONE.
