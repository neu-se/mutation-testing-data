  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.attributes !== null` is always true, and would always cause the if statement to evaluate to true, even if the `otherOp.attributes` do not contain the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes == null` is always false, and would cause the if statement to evaluate to false, regardless of the value of `thisOp.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes` would cause the if statement to evaluate to true only if the `thisOp.attributes` and `otherOp.attributes` are not equal, which is different from the original behavior, which evaluated to true only if the `thisOp.attributes` contains the expected value.
