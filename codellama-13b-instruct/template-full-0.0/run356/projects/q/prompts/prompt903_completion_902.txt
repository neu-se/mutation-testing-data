  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of rejected, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a Node-style resolver instead of being rejected, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
