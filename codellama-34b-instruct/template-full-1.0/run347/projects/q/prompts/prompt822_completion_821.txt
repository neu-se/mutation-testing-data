  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` would not throw an error if the fulfilled promise is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` would not throw an error if the fulfilled promise is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` would throw an error if the fulfilled promise is an instance of Error.

DONE.
