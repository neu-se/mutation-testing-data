 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { /* empty arrow function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would no longer reject the promise with the provided reason, but instead would simply return an unresolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would now return a resolved promise with the value of the `reason` variable, rather than rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would now throw a new error object instead of the original `reason` variable, which could potentially affect how errors are handled downstream.

DONE.
