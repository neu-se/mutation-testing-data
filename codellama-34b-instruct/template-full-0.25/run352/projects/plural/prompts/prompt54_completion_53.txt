  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression with the `i` flag to perform a case-insensitive replacement, while this new code fragment only replaces the literal string `'ves'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves').toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not convert the result of the replacement to lowercase, while this new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves').toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not convert the result of the replacement to uppercase, while this new code fragment does.

DONE.
