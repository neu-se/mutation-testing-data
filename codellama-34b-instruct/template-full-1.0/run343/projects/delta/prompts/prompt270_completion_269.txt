  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if the condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, even if the condition is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return undefined, even if the condition is true.

DONE.
