  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in object; var key in array;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator will return `true` for both the object and the array, while the original code fragment only checks for the presence of the key in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator will return `false` for the `null` object, while the original code fragment would still check for the presence of the key in the object and possibly return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator will return `false` for the `undefined` object, while the original code fragment would still check for the presence of the key in the object and possibly return `true`.

DONE.
