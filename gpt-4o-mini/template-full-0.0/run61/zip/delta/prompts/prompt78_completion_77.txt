Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are strings instead of numbers, which would always evaluate to false, preventing the merging of delete operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' ||
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator instead of AND, which would allow the condition to pass if either `newOp.delete` or `lastOp.delete` is a number, potentially leading to incorrect merging of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for the `insert` property instead of the `delete` property, which would lead to merging operations based on the wrong criteria.

DONE.
