  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.length
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is a property of an array, whereas "done" is a property of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.error
```
This would result in different behavior because "error" is a property of a promise, whereas "length" is a property of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment mutates the value of "result" by multiplying it by 2, whereas the original code fragment does not mutate the value of "result".

DONE.
