  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    process.nextTick(flush);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called twice, once by `process.nextTick` and once by `setTimeout`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
