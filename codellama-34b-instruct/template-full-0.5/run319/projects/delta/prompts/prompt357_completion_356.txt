  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.insert` is not a valid property of the `arg` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.delete` is not a valid property of the `arg` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.retain` is not a valid property of the `arg` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
