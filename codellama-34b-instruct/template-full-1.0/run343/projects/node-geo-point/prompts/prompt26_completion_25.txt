  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the distance between two points on a sphere to always return 0, regardless of the actual distance between the points. This would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateBearing` and `calculateDestination` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(-Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the distance between two points on a sphere to always return a negative value, regardless of the actual distance between the points. This would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateBearing` and `calculateDestination` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the distance between two points on a sphere to always return a positive value, regardless of the actual distance between the points. This would lead to incorrect
