  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not incremented in the original code, so the `eachLine` method would not iterate over all lines in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not decremented in the original code, so the `eachLine` method would not iterate over all lines in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not multiplied by 2 in the original code, so the `eachLine` method would not iterate over all lines in the delta.

DONE.
