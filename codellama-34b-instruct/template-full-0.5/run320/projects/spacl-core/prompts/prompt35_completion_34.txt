  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is removed, causing the parts to be returned in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).filter(p => p !== '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method is added, causing any empty parts to be removed from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).map(p => p.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method is added, causing all parts to be converted to lowercase.

DONE.
