  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `reason` object is not defined, so the resulting string would be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `reason` object is not defined, so the resulting string would be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `reason` object is not defined, so the resulting string would be different from the original.

DONE.
