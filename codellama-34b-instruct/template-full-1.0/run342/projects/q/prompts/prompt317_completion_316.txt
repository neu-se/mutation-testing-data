  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to immediately resolve with a value of `null`, rather than waiting for the original promise to resolve with its intended value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to immediately resolve with a value of `undefined`, rather than waiting for the original promise to resolve with its intended value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to immediately resolve with a value of an empty object `{}`, rather than waiting for the original promise to resolve with its intended value.

DONE.
