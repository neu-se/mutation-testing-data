 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'href' attribute of the 'body' element instead of the 'base' element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'prop' method instead of the 'attr' method, which could return a different value or cause an error if 'href' is not a property of the 'base' element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('head base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'href' attribute of the 'base' element within the 'head' element, which may not exist or contain the desired value.

DONE.
