  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the callback if it is defined, whereas the original code would always call the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback if it is defined, or if it is undefined, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? cb() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback if it is defined, or do nothing if it is undefined, which would result in no error.

DONE.
