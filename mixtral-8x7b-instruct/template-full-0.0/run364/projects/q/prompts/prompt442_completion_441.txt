 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"unhandledrejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is case-sensitive, and the original code uses the camelCase version "unhandledRejection".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"unhandledException"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name does not match the expected "unhandledRejection" event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
