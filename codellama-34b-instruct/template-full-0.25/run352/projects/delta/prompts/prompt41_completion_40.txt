  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(a)` returns an array of keys in the `a` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values as `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(a)` returns an array of values in the `a` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values as `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(a)` returns an array of key-value pairs in the `a` object, while `attributes` returns an object with the same keys and values as `a`.

DONE.
