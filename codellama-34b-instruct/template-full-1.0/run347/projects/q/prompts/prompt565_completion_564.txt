  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `reject` function is called with the exception as an argument, which would result in a rejected promise. However, if `null` is used instead, the promise would be resolved with the value `null` instead of being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `reject` function is called with the exception as an argument, which would result in a rejected promise. However, if the string `"error"` is used instead, the promise would be resolved with the value `"error"` instead of being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `reject` function is called with the exception as an argument, which would result in a rejected promise. However, if a new error is created and passed to the `reject`
