Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the promise is fulfilled by comparing its state to the string "pending" instead of "fulfilled", leading to incorrect results when calling `isFulfilled`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic to check if the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled, causing the `isFulfilled` method to return true for rejected promises, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for any state that is not "fulfilled", including "pending" and "rejected", thus incorrectly indicating that a promise is fulfilled when it is not.

DONE.
