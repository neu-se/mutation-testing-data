  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the given reason, rather than resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function is called with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the given reason, rather than resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the given reason, rather than resolved with the given value.

DONE.
