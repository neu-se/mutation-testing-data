Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a delay of 1000 milliseconds before calling `flush`, which could lead to tasks being executed later than intended, potentially causing issues with task ordering and timing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() { console.log('Flush called'); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `flush`, it logs a message to the console, preventing the actual flushing of tasks and potentially leading to unprocessed tasks in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush.bind(null), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which `flush` is called, which may not be relevant if `flush` relies on the original context, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
