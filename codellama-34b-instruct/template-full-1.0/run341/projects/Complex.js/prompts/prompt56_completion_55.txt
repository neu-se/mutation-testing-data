  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```php
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `phi` is a different property than `arg`, and the function would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```php
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is a different property than `arg`, and the function would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```php
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a different property than `arg`, and the function would return a different result.

DONE.
