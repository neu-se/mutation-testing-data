 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison between a number and a string would be done lexicographically instead of numerically, potentially causing unexpected results in the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison between a number and a boolean would always be true, potentially causing unexpected results in the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison between a number and null would always be false, potentially causing unexpected results in the `isInternalFrame` function.

DONE.
