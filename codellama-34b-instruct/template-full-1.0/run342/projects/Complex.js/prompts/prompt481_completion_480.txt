  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this.isInfinite()` would return `true` only if `this` is an instance of `Complex` and its imaginary part is not equal to 0, while the new code fragment `!this.isInfinite()` would return `true` if `this` is not an instance of `Complex` or its imaginary part is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this.isInfinite()` would return `true` only if `this` is an instance of `Complex` and its real part is not equal to its imaginary part, while the new code fragment `this['re'] !== this['im']` would return `true` if `this` is not an instance of `Complex` or its real part is not equal to its imaginary part.
