  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections()` function would be called twice, which would clear the `unhandledRejections` array and `unhandledReasons` array, potentially hiding any unhandled rejections that occurred before the `coerce()` function was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to `false`, which would prevent any unhandled rejections from being tracked and potentially hidden.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array would be cleared, potentially hiding any unhandled rejections that occurred before the `coerce()` function was called.

DONE.
