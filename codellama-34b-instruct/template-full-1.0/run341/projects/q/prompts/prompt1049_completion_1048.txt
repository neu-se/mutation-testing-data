  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Can't get value from closed queue");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error every time the `get` method is called, whereas the original code only throws an error if the queue is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` every time the `get` method is called, whereas the original code returns the value of the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Can't get value from closed queue");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new error object every time the `get` method is called, whereas the original code returns the original error object.

DONE.
