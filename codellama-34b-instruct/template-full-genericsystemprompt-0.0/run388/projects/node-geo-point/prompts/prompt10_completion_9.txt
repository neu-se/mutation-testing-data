  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is defined on the `point` object, rather than checking if the `coordinates` property is defined on the `point` object and is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is defined on the `point` object and is an array, rather than checking if the `coordinates` property is defined on the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is defined on the `point` object and has a length of 2,
