Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.substring(0, val.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character from the string instead of removing trailing zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the decimal part of the number entirely, instead of just removing trailing zeros.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.replace(/\.0+$/, '0')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces trailing zeros with a single '0', instead of removing them entirely, which could affect the resulting string if it's used in further calculations or comparisons.

DONE.
