Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the returned value by adding 1, which changes the outcome of the promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `undefined` instead of the actual value, which would lead to unexpected results when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a boolean indicating whether the generator is done, rather than the value yielded, which would not fulfill the promise as intended.

DONE.
