 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `false` or `null` even if the policy exists in the map, as the policy would be replaced with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `false` or `null` even if the policy exists in the map, as the policy would be replaced with an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Policy('', [], [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return the result of the new policy's `query` method, which might have different behavior than the original policy.

DONE.
