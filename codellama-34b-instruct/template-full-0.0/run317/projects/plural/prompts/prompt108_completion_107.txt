  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the input word with an 'es' added to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the input word with an 's' added to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the input word with an 'ies' added to the end
