  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterStackString` is a function that expects to be called with a `this` value of `null`, but by using `bind`, we are changing the `this` value to be the global object, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterStackString` is a function that expects to be called with a `this` value of `null`, but by using `call`, we are changing the `this` value to be the global object, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterStackString` is a function that expects to be called with a `this` value of `null`, but by using `apply`, we are changing the
