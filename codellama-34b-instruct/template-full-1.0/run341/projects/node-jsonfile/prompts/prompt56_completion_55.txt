  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method replaces all occurrences of a substring in a string, while the `split` method returns an array of strings by separating the string at every occurrence of a specified separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns the original string with all occurrences of the substring replaced, while the `substr` method returns a portion of the string, starting at a specified position and continuing to the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns the original string with all occurrences of the substring replaced, while the `slice` method returns a portion of the string, starting at a specified position and ending at another specified position.

DONE.
