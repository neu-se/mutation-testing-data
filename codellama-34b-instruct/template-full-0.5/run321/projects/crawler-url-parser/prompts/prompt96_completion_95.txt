  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra comma at the end of the argument list, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr + "?query=param",
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a query parameter to the URL, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr, false,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `normalizeHttps` option to `false`, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different object.

DONE.
