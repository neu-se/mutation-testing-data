  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to always return `null` as the second argument to the callback, regardless of whether the input data is null or not. This will likely cause tests that expect a non-null value to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to always return `undefined` as the second argument to the callback, regardless of whether the input data is null or not. This will likely cause tests that expect a non-null value to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This change will cause the `map` function to always return the original input data as the second argument to the callback, regardless of whether the input data is null or not. This will likely cause tests that expect a transformed value to fail.

DONE.
