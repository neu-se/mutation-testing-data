  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected | function(){ throw "new Error()" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the "rejected" function is not defined, which would lead to a ReferenceError being thrown. This change would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected | function(x){ return x + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the "rejected" function is not defined, which would lead to a ReferenceError being thrown. This change would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected | function(x){ return x + "1" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the "rejected" function is not defined, which would lead to a ReferenceError being thrown. This change would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.
