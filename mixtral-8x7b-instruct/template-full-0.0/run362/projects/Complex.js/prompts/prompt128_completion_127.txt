 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex['INFINITY']` when subtracting two complex numbers, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current complex number is infinite, rather than checking if the input `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `DivideByZeroError` exception, while the original code fragment would return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

DONE.
