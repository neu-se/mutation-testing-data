  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because bind creates a new function, so the original flush function will remain unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because toString returns a string representation of the function, so it would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because setImmediate schedules the function to be executed at a later time, so it would not be executed immediately.

DONE.
