  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a non-null object, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a defined object, while `undefined` is an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a non-empty object, while `{}` is an empty object.

DONE.
