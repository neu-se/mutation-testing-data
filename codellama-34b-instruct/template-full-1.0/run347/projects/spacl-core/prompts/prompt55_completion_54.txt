  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part}*`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is applied to the entire string, instead of just the last character, which could match more segments than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part}+`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is applied to the entire string, instead of just the last character, which could match more segments than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part}.`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.` operator is applied to the entire string, instead of just the last character, which could match more segments than intended.

DONE.
