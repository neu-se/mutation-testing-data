Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is infinite, which would change the logic of the subtraction operation and potentially lead to incorrect results when dealing with infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass if `this` is not infinite, which could lead to incorrect handling of infinite values in the subtraction operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly combines the checks for both `this` and `z` being infinite using a logical AND, which would not function as intended since `isInfinite` is a method and should be called as such, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect logic.

DONE.
