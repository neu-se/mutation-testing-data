  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the base URL string, potentially changing the protocol or host of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the embedded base URL string, potentially changing the protocol or host of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the parsed URL's host, potentially changing the domain or subdomain of the URL.

DONE.
