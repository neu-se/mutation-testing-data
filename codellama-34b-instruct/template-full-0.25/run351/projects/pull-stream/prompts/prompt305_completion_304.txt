  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called only if `ended` is truthy, whereas the original code would call `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called only if `ended` is falsy, whereas the original code would call `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called only if `ended` is falsy, whereas the original code would call `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

DONE.
