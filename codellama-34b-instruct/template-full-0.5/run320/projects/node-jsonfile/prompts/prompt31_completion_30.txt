  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects an object, but `options.encoding` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a function, but `options.reviver` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a boolean, but `options.throws` is an object.

DONE.
