  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` returns `false` for `null`, but the original code fragment only checks if `ops` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` returns `false` for `undefined`, but the original code fragment only checks if `ops` is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` returns `false` for `0`, but the original code fragment only checks if `ops` is an array.

DONE.
