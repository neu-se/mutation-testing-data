  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
