  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `attributes` argument as `iter.next(1).attributes || {}`, which ensures that the attributes are not `null` or `undefined`. In contrast, the modified code fragment would pass an empty object as the `attributes` argument, which could cause the `predicate` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `attributes` argument as `{}`, which is an empty object. In contrast, the modified code fragment would pass the attributes of the next operation as the `attributes` argument, which could cause the `predicate` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(2).attributes, i)
