  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function instead of `memoizeCountry`, which would lead to incorrect caching of timezone objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the result of `buildCountry` to the `countries` object directly without checking if the country already exists, leading to duplicate entries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = { name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign an object with the `name` property set to `name` instead of using the `buildTimezone` function, which could lead to incorrect timezone objects being constructed.

DONE.
