  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds a space to the text if it is not null, while this modified code fragment would always add a space to the text, even if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds the text to the URL map if it is not null, while this modified code fragment would always add the uppercase version of the text to the URL map, even if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds the text to the URL map if it is not null, while this modified code fragment would always add the text with all spaces removed to the URL map, even if it is null.

DONE.
