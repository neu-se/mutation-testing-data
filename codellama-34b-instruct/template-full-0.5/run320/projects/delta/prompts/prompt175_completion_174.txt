  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation in the other delta, rather than the length of the current operation in the this delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the current operation in the this delta plus one, which could result in the algorithm skipping over a portion of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the minimum of the length of the current operation in the this delta and the length of the next operation in the other delta, which could result in the algorithm incorrectly handling the case where the two operations have different lengths.

DONE.
