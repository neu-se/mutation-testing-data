  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new deferred object, which is different from the original `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.makePromise()` returns a new promise object, which is different from the original `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which is different from the original `Q` object.

DONE.
