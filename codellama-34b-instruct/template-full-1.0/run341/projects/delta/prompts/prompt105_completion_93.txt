  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` would add an additional operation to the `ops` array, while `forEach` would iterate over the existing operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` would remove the last operation from the `ops` array, while `forEach` would iterate over the existing operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` would remove the first operation from the `ops` array, while `forEach` would iterate over the existing operations.

DONE.
