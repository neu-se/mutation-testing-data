  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the string value of the error message, which would affect the output of the `reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the string value of the error message, which would affect the output of the `reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the string value of the error message, which would affect the output of the `reject` method.

DONE.
