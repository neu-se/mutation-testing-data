  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.call` is a different method than `call.apply`, and it has a different implementation. In the context of the code, `call.apply` is used to apply a function to an array of arguments, while `call.call` is used to apply a function to a specific number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.bind` is a method that returns a new function that, when called, will in turn call the original function with a specific `this` context and arguments. In the context of the code, `call.bind` could be used to bind the `this` context of the `call` function to a specific object, which would affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.apply !== call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for strict
