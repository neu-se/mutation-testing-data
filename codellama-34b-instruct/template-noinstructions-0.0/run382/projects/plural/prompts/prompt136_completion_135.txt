  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)` to get the type of the object, while this replacement would return the lowercase version of the type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)` to get the type of the object, while this replacement would return the uppercase version of the type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + type.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)` to get the type of the object, while this replacement would return the type with the first letter capitalized.
