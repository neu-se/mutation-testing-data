  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object, while this replacement returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with the same ops as the current Delta object, while this replacement returns a new Delta object with an empty ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta([{ retain: 1 }]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with the same ops as the current Delta object, while this replacement returns a new Delta object with a single retain op that retains 1 character.

DONE.
