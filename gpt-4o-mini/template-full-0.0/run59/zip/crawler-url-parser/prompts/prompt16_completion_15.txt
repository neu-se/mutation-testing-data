Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the fragment of the URL with the string 'error', potentially altering the intended URL structure and leading to incorrect parsing or resolution of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the fragment to `null` would remove it entirely, which could lead to unexpected results in the URL parsing logic, especially if the rest of the code expects a string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the fragment with the string 'undefined' would create an invalid URL fragment, which could cause the URL parsing to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
