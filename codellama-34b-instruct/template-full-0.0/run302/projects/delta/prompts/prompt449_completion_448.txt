  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is not a number. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is `undefined`. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is `null`. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be
