  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would add "is" to the input word instead of "es", which would produce incorrect results for words that should end in "-es", such as "box".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would remove the last character of the input word before adding "es", which would produce incorrect results for words that should not have their last character removed, such as "boxes".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w[0] + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would only add "es" to the first letter of the input word, which would produce incorrect results for words that should have "es" added to the end, such as "
