  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the string contains illegal characters, while this new code fragment would check if the string contains any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the entire string contains illegal characters, while this new code fragment would check if the first character of the string contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the string contains illegal characters, while this new code fragment would remove any illegal characters from the string before checking if it contains any characters.

DONE.
