  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is not the same as `onFulfilled`, and the logic within the `when` function would be executed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, and the logic within the `when` function would be executed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise, and the logic within the `when` function would be executed differently.

DONE.
