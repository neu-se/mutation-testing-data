Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the object is strictly equal to `null`, failing to catch other non-object types like numbers or strings, which would not throw the intended error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow strings to pass through the check, leading to a TypeError when trying to access properties like `latitude` and `longitude` on a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow non-array objects to pass the check, which would not trigger the intended TypeError, as it would only throw an error for arrays, not for objects that are not arrays.

DONE.
