  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of an array cannot be less than zero, so the promise would never be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled if there are any promises in the array, even if they are all rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would only be fulfilled if there is exactly one promise in the array, and it is rejected.

DONE.
