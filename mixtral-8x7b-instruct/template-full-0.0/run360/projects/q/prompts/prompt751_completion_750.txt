 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved even if an error occurs, instead of being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would not include the error message, making it harder to debug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be logged to the console instead of being passed to the rejected handler, potentially causing the application to continue execution without handling the error.

DONE.
