  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options` variable is a string, rather than checking if the type of `options` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `options` variable to a string and then check if it is equal to the string 'string', rather than checking if the type of `options` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the type of `options` is an object, rather than checking if the type of `options` is a string.

DONE.
