  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements, and the `i` variable is incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements, and the `i` variable is incremented by 2.

DONE.
