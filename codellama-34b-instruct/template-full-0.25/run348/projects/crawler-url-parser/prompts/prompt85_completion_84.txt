  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while this new code fragment uses `split()` to split the text into an array of words and then takes the first word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, "");
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().slice(0, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while this new code fragment uses `
