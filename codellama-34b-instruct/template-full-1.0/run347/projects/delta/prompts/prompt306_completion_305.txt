  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` returns the size of the line in pixels, while `length` returns the number of characters in the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.width
```
This would result in different behavior because `width` returns the width of the line in pixels, while `length` returns the number of characters in the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `text.length` returns the number of characters in the line, while `length` returns the number of characters in the line + the line break character.

DONE.
