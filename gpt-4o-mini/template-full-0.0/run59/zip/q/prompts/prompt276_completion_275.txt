Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the original error object, it rejects with a string message, which may not provide the necessary context or information about the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a `null` value instead of the actual error, which could lead to confusion as the rejection reason would not indicate what went wrong.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise instead of rejecting it, which contradicts the intended error handling logic and could lead to unexpected behavior in promise chains.

DONE.
