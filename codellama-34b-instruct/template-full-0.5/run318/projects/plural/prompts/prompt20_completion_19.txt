  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds an 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' or 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment does not modify the word at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' or 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds both 'es'
