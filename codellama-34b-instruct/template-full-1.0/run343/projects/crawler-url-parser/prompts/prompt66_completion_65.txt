  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split('&')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method with no argument, which splits the search string by any non-empty sequence of whitespace, while this code fragment splits the search string by the ampersand character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.trim().split('&')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not trim the search string, while this code fragment trims the search string before splitting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\s+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string by any non-empty sequence of whitespace, while this code fragment splits the search string by one or more whitespace characters.

DONE.
