  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype` is a specific object that has its own properties and methods, while `Object.prototype` is the base object for all objects in JavaScript and has different properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype` is a specific object that has its own properties and methods, while `Function.prototype` is the base object for all functions in JavaScript and has different properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype` is a specific object that has its own properties and methods, while `Array.prototype` is the base object for all arrays in JavaScript and has different properties and methods.

DONE.
