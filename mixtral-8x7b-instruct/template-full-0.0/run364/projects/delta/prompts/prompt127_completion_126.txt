 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of advancing the iterator, it would move backwards, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same operation instead of advancing to the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of advancing the iterator, causing unpredictable results.

DONE.
