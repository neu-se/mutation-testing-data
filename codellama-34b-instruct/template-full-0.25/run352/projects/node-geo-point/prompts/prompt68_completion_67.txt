  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and it may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + 1` is a different expression than `x`, and it may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(x)` is a different function than `x`, and it may have a different value.

DONE.
