 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `cb(true)` once the `i` is equal to `array.length`, even if there are remaining elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` and never iterate through the array elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to access an index out of bounds, resulting in an error, instead of returning the remaining elements in the array.

DONE.
