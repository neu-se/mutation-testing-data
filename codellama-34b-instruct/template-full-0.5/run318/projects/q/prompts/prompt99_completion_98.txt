  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never run, as the condition is always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, as the condition is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run once, as the condition is true only on the first iteration.

DONE.
