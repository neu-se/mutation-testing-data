  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This change will cause the `requestPortTick` function to post a message to `port1` instead of `port2`, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0)
```
This change will cause the `requestPortTick` function to post a message with the value `0` to `port2`, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(1)
```
This change will cause the `requestPortTick` function to post a message with the value `1` to `port2`, which may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
