  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.length + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would always be one higher than the original string, causing the function to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w[0] = 'a'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would modify the first character of the input string to always be 'a', making the output inconsistent with the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w[1] = w[1].toLowerCase(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would modify the second character of the input string to always be lowercase, making the output inconsistent with the original implementation.

DONE.
