  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is used to calculate the magnitude of the complex number, and adding 1 to it would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is used to calculate the magnitude of the complex number, and subtracting 1 from it would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is used to calculate the magnitude of the complex number, and multiplying it by 2 would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
