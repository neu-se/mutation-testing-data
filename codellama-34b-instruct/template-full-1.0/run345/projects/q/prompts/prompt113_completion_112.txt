  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f(t,v);
```
This would result in different behavior because `f` is not defined in the provided code, so the replacement would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply;
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply` is a method that accepts an argument list, whereas `callback.call` is a method that accepts a `this` argument and a variable number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype.call.bind(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a bound function that has a different `this` value than the original code.

DONE.
