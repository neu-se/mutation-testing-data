  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` returns a substring, while `split` returns an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` performs a string replacement, while `split` performs a split operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if a string contains a specific substring, while `split` performs a split operation.

DONE.
