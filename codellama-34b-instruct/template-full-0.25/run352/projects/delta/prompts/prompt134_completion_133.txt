  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object, which may not be the same as the original `nextOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `retain` property of the `nextOp` object, which may not be the same as the original `nextOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `delete` property of the `nextOp` object, which may not be the same as the original `nextOp` object.

DONE.
