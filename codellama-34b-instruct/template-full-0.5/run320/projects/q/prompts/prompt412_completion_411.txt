  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the promise is not pending instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the promise has a value instead of being fulfilled.

DONE.
