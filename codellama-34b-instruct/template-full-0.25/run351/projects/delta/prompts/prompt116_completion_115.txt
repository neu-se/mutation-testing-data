  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of `accum` is not taken into account, and the `index` parameter is not used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter is used to modify the result of the addition, which could affect the final value of `accum`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr * (index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter is used to modify the result of the addition, and the `+ 1` term ensures that the result is always positive.

DONE.
