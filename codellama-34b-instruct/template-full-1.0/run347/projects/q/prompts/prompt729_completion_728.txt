  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reduced value, while this new code fragment modifies the `promises` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reduced value, while this new code fragment modifies the `promises` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reduced value, while this new code fragment modifies the `promises` array.

DONE.
