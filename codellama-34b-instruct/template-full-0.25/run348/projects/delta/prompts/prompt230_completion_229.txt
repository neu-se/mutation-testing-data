  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `diff` function to consider one more character than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `diff` function to consider one fewer character than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `diff` function to consider twice as many characters as it should.

DONE.
