  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Object.defineProperty` function with an empty function, which would prevent any properties from being defined on the `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty = function(obj, prop, descriptor) {
  if (descriptor.value === undefined) {
    descriptor.value = function() {};
  }
  return Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Object.defineProperty` function with a new function that sets the `value` property of the descriptor object to an empty function if it is undefined. This would cause any properties defined on the `Complex` object to be functions that do nothing, which would likely cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty = function(obj, prop,
