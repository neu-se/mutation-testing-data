  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which would change the behavior of `then` and potentially cause unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with the `this` context set to `null`, which would change the behavior of `then` and potentially cause unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with the `this` context set to `undefined`, which would change the behavior of `then` and potentially cause unintended consequences.

DONE.
