  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result.value` would be returned as a promise, whereas the original code would return the fulfilled value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result.value` would be returned as a promise, and the `then` method would be used to extract the fulfilled value of the promise, whereas the original code would return the fulfilled value of the promise directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
}, function (error) {
    return error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result.value` would be returned as a promise, and the `then` method would be used to extract the ful
