  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = buildTimezone(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` object is being modified directly, rather than being updated through the `memoizeTimezone` function.

DONE.
