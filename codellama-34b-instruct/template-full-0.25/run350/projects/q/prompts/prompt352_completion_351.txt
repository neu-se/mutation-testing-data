  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would return a resolved promise with a value of null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise, while this new code fragment would return a resolved promise with a value of undefined.

DONE.
