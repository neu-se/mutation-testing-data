  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if `err` is not `true`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if `err` is not strictly equal to `true`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if `err` is not falsy, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
