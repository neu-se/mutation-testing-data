  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be skipped, causing the `delete` operation to be applied even if it should have been skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operation would be applied even if it should have been skipped, causing the `delete` operation to be applied even if it should have been skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'delete' && offset >= index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied even if it should have been skipped, causing the `delete` operation to be applied even if it should have been skipped.

DONE.
