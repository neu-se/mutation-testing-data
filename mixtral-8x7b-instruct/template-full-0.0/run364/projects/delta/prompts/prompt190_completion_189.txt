 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, rather than the end using `push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array, rather than creating a new one like `push` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.length = 0; delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it first resets the `length` property of the `delta.ops` array and then adds a new element, while the original code only appends a new element.

DONE.
