  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while `null` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while `undefined` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while `0` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

DONE.
