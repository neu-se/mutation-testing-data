 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
laterQueue = laterQueue.concat(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the global `laterQueue` variable, changing the behavior of the `nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
laterQueue.unshift(task)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the task to the beginning of the `laterQueue` array instead of the end, causing tasks to be executed in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(task, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `setTimeout` instead of adding the task to the `laterQueue` array, bypassing the scheduled execution of tasks and causing them to be executed immediately.

DONE.
