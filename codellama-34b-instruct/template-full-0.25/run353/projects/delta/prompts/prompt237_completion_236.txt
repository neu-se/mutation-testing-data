  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of iterations in the loop, and decrementing it by 1 would result in one fewer iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of iterations in the loop, and incrementing it by 1 would result in one more iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of iterations in the loop, and multiplying it by 2 would result in twice as many iterations.

DONE.
