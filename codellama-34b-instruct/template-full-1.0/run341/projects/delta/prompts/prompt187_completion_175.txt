  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  throw new Error('Not implemented');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original implementation would return a function that can handle the embed type, but the new implementation would throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  return (data) => {
    return data;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original implementation would return a function that can handle the embed type, but the new implementation would return a function that simply returns the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  let handler = null;
  for (let key in handlers) {
    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      let value = handlers[key];
      if (value.type === embedType) {
        handler = value.handler;
        break;
