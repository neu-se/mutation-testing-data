 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` might return a different string representation of the object compared to the original `url` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl['url']
```
This would result in different behavior because using bracket notation to access the `url` property can lead to unexpected behavior if the `url` property is shadowed by another property with the same name in the scope of the `currentUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.__proto__.url
```
This would result in different behavior because accessing the `url` property through the prototype chain can lead to unexpected behavior if the `url` property is overridden in the `currentUrl` object.

DONE.
