  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `!resolve` is the logical NOT operator, and it would always return `false` in this context, even if the promise was resolved. This would cause the `deferred.resolve()` call to never be executed, and the promise would never be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(null)` would resolve the promise with a value of `null`, which is different from the original behavior where the promise was resolved with the value returned by the `_fulfilled` function. This would cause the `deferred.resolve()` call to be executed with a different value, and the promise would be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(reject)` would resolve the promise with a value of `reject`, which is a function that rejects
