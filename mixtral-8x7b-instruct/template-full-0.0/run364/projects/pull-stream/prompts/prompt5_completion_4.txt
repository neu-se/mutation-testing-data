 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the `throughs` object by 2, which is not equivalent to including the properties of the `throughs` object in the `exports` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, throughs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with the same properties as the `throughs` object, but does not include any methods or other properties that might be present on the original `throughs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `throughs` object with its `hasOwnProperty` method, which is a function that is used to determine whether an object has a specific property.

DONE.
