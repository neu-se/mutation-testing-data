  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with a parameter of 10 would remove the first 10 characters from the URL, potentially changing the protocol from "https" to "http".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with a parameter of 10 would remove the first 10 characters from the URL, potentially changing the protocol from "https" to "http".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('ftp')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with a parameter of 10 would remove the first 10 characters from the URL, potentially changing the protocol from "https" to "ftp".

DONE.
