  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` check would now also check if the object has the properties `latitude` and `longitude`, which would cause the `TypeError` to be thrown if the object does not have these properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject || !object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` check would now only be performed if the object does not have the properties `latitude` and `longitude`, which would cause the `TypeError` to be thrown if the object does have these properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
