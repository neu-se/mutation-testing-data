  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get(key)` is a method that retrieves the value associated with the given key from the database, while `this._data.get(key)` is a method that retrieves the value associated with the given key from the in-memory cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set(key, undefined)` would set the value associated with the given key to `undefined`, while `this.get(key)` would retrieve the value associated with the given key from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rm(key)` would remove the key from the database, while `this.get(key)` would retrieve the value associated with the given key from the database.

DONE.
