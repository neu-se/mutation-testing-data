  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is looking for the imaginary unit 'i' or 'I', but the replacement code is looking for the imaginary unit 'j' or 'J'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is looking for the imaginary unit 'i' or 'I', but the replacement code is looking for the imaginary unit 'I' or 'J'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is looking for the imaginary unit 'i' or 'I', but the replacement code is looking for the imaginary unit 'i', 'j', or 'J'.

DONE.
