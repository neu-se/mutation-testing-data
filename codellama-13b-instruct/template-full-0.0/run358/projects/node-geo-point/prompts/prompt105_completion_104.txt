  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the x-coordinate of a tile based on the longitude of a coordinate, while the buggy code fragment calculates the x-coordinate based on the longitude plus 180 degrees. This would result in a different tile being returned, which could affect the accuracy of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 360) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the x-coordinate of a tile based on the longitude of a coordinate, while the buggy code fragment calculates the x-coordinate based on the longitude plus 360 degrees. This would result in a different tile being returned, which could affect the accuracy of the calculation.
