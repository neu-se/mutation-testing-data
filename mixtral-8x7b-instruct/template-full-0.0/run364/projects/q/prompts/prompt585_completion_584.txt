 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new QDoneException();
```
This would result in different behavior because QDoneException is not a constructor function in the provided code, and it would throw a `TypeError` when called as a constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Done'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an error instead of resolving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise, bypassing the original behavior of the `spawn` function.

DONE.
