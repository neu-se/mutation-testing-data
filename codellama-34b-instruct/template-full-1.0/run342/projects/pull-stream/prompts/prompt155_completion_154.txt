  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only invoke the callback if `abort` is truthy, while this modified code fragment would invoke the callback regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `abort` value as an argument to `abortCb`, while this modified code fragment would pass the `onAbort` value as an argument instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass `null` as the first argument and the `value` as the second argument to the callback, while this modified code fragment would pass `null` as the first argument and the `abort` value as the second argument instead.

DONE.
