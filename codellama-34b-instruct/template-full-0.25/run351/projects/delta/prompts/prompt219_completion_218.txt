  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to always return an empty delta, as the two ops would never be equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to always return an empty delta, as the two ops would never have the same length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length < other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to always return an empty delta, as the first op would always be shorter than the second op.

DONE.
