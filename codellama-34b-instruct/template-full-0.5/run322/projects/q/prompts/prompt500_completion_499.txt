  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the first argument, and the remaining arguments will be passed as arguments to the new function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a method that returns a string representing the object.

DONE.
