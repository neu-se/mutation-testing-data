  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment only referenced the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(null)` would execute the `onAbort` function with a different `this` context, whereas the original code fragment did not specify a `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.bind(null)` would create a new function that, when called, would execute `onAbort` with a different `this` context, whereas the original code fragment did not specify a `this` context.

DONE.
