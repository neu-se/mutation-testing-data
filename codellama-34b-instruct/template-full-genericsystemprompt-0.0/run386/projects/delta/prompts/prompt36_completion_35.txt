  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` is always truthy, so the `!priority` check would always fail, even if `priority` is set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority && b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!priority && b` would only be true if `priority` is `false` and `b` is truthy. In the original code, `b` is always an object, so this check would always fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority || b
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority || b` would only be true if `priority` is `true` or `b` is truthy. In the original code, `b` is always an object, so this check would always succeed.

DONE.
