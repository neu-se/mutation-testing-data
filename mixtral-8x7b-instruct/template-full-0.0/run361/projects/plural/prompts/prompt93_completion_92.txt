 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chili', 'chilis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the British English spelling 'chillies', while this change uses the American English spelling 'chilis'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilli', 'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the array is not the correct plural form of 'chilli'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilli', 'chills'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'chills' is not the correct plural form of 'chilli'.

DONE.
