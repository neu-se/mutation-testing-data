  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(array_slice).delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that resolves to `array_slice`, but the delay would cause the code to wait for 1000 milliseconds before calling `delay`. This would cause a delay in the execution of the code, but would not affect the behavior of the `delay` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that rejects with the `array_slice` error, instead of returning the `array_slice` array. This would cause the code to fail and enter the `Q.reject` clause, which would not happen in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(array_slice, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because
