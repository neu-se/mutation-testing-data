  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the imaginary part of the result to be doubled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by 2 would cause the imaginary part of the result to be halved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the imaginary part of the result to be increased by 1.

DONE.
