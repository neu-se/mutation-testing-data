  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function without any arguments, whereas the original code fragment calls the function with the `args` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name](args[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with only the first argument from the `args` array, whereas the original code fragment calls the function with all the arguments from the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name](args.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with all the arguments from the `args` array except the first one, whereas the original code fragment calls the function with all the arguments from the `args` array.

DONE.
