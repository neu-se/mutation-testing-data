  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but this replacement code fragment does not. This means that the calculation of the distance between the two points would be incorrect, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but this replacement code fragment does not. This means that the calculation of the distance between the two points would be incorrect, leading to different behavior.
