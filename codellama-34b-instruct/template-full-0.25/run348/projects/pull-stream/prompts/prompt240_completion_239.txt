  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, which would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds one to the value of `end`, which would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator subtracts one from the value of `end`, which would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
