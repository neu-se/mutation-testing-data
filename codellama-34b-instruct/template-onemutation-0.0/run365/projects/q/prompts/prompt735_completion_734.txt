  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when all items in an array are fulfilled, while `none` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when none of the items in an array are fulfilled.

DONE.
