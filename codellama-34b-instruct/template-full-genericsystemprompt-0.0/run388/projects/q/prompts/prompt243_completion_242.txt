  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and `undefined` is a primitive value. The `===` operator checks for strict equality, so this replacement would cause the code to behave differently when `resolvedPromise` is a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `resolvedPromise` is a promise object. The `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so this replacement would cause the code to behave differently when `resolvedPromise` is a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and `undefined` is a primitive value. This replacement would cause the code to behave differently when `resolved
