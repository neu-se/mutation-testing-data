  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the value of `e` raised to the power of the argument, whereas `Math.expm1` returns the value of `e` raised to the power of the argument minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the base-10 logarithm of the argument, whereas `Math.expm1` returns the value of `e` raised to the power of the argument minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the argument, whereas `Math.expm1` returns the value of `e` raised to the power of the argument minus one.

DONE.
