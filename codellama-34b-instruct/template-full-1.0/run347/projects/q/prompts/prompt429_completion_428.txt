  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect()` returns a string representation of the object, while `object.inspect` returns the `inspect` method itself. This would cause the code to fail when trying to access the `state` property of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.call(object)` returns the result of calling the `inspect` method on the `object` instance, while `object.inspect()` returns the `inspect` method itself. This would cause the code to fail when trying to access the `state` property of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object["inspect"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object["inspect"]` returns the `inspect` property of the `object` instance, while `object.inspect`
