  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `z['re']` variable is used in the `Complex` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'], z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z['re']` and `z['im']` variables are used in the `Complex` constructor, but the `a` variable is not used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'], z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z['im']` and `z['re']` variables are used in the `Complex` constructor, but the `a` variable is not used.

DONE.
