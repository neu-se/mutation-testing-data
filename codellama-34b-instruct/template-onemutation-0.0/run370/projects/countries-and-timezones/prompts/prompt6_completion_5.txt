  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `buildTimezonesMap` function expects an object as its argument, and using `null` would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
