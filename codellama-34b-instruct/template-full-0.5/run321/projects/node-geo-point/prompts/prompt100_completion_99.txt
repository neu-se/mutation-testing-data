  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(φ2) + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is a simple conversion from radians to degrees, and adding 180 to the result would cause the latitude value to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(φ2) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is a simple conversion from radians to degrees, and multiplying the result by 2 would cause the latitude value to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(φ2) - 90;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is a simple conversion from radians to degrees, and subtracting 90 from the result would cause the latitude value to be incorrect.

DONE.
