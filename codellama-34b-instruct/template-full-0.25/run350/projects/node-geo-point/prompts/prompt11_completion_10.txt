  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + 'foobar'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to fail when the `point` object does not have a `foobar` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + 'length'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to fail when the `point` object does not have a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to fail when the `point` object does not have a `0` property.

DONE.
