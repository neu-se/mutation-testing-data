 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison checks for nullability instead of checking if `retain` is a number. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with operations that have a retain value of `null` but are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `retain` is a string, whereas the original code checks if it's a number. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with operations that have a retain value of a non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof thisOp.retain === 'symbol'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `retain` is a symbol, whereas the original code checks if it's a number. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with operations that have a
