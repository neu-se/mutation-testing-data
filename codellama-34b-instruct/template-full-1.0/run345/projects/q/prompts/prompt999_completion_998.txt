  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve 
```

This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a built-in method of a promise that is used to resolve the promise with a given value. Using `deferred.resolve` in place of `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, instead of failing when the original code would have.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback 
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function that is used as a callback in the original code. Using it in place of `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail` would cause the callback to be called with the current value of the promise, instead of failing when the original code would have. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a function
