  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be negated, causing the `find` function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called without any arguments, causing the `find` function to always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, causing the `find` function to always return `true`.

DONE.
