  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops == null || !Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ops` object is not null and has an `ops` property that is an array, while this code fragment checks if the `ops` object is null or has an `ops` property that is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && !Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ops` object is not null and has an `ops` property that is an array, while this code fragment checks if the `ops` object is not null and has an `ops` property that is not an array.
