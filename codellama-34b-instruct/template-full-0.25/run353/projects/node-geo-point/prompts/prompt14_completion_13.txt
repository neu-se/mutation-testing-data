  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would invert the result of the `Array.isArray` check, potentially causing the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is not necessarily the same as the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with a single element that is an empty array would have a `length` of 1, but the number of elements in the array would be 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if an array includes a specific element, and `undefined` is a valid element in an array. If the array does not include `undefined`, the code would throw an error
