  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would always return `false`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would always return `null`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would always return `undefined`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
