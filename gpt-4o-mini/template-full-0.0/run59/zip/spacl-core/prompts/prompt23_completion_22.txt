Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input string by removing the first character, which could lead to incorrect matching results if the first character is significant in the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a slash to the end of the input string, which would cause the matcher to return `null` for any string that originally did not end with a slash, thus altering the matching logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the entire input string to uppercase, which could lead to mismatches if the original regex is case-sensitive and the input string contains lowercase characters.

DONE.
