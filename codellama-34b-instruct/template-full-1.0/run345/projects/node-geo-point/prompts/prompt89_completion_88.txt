  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the `asin` function would be flipped, causing the returned latitude value to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the `asin` function would be incorrect, causing the returned latitude value to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the `atan2` function would be flipped, causing the returned longitude value to be incorrect.

DONE.
