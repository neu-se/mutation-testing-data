  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred.reject).fapply(nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `deferred.reject` function, even if the promise is resolved, rather than calling `deferred.reject` only if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `callback` function, even if the promise is resolved, rather than calling `callback` only if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled(deferred).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `deferred.reject` function, even if the promise is resolved, rather than calling `deferred.reject` only if the promise is rejected. Additionally, it would pass the results of all promises to the `deferred.reject
