 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'.concat(spec.split('').slice(1).reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses each character instead of the path segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the path segments instead of the segment list itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'.concat(spec.split('/').slice(1).map(x => x.split('').reverse().join('')))
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses each character within each path segment, instead of reversing the order of the path segments.

DONE.
