  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a different base and exponent, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a different base and exponent, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a different base and exponent, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
