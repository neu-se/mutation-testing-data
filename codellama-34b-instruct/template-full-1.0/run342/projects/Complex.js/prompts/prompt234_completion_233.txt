  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the less than or equal to operator (<=), while the mutated code uses the less than operator (<). This would cause the method to return a different result in the case where `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the less than or equal to operator (<=), while the mutated code uses the greater than operator (>). This would cause the method to return a different result in the case where `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not considering the case where `b` is greater than 0. The mutated code would only return the original result when `b` is less than or equal to 0.

DONE.
