  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'function'` instead of `'object'`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'undefined'` instead of `'object'`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `if` block to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'string'` instead of `'object'`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed.

DONE.
