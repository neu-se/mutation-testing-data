  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Op.length(elem);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length()` is undefined in this context and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Op.length(this.ops[this.ops.length - 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.ops.length - 1]` is not necessarily the same element as `elem`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Op.length(other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]` is not necessarily the same element as `elem`.

DONE.
