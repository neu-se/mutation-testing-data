  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to `a`, whereas the original code fragment would have compared `a` to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the original code fragment would have checked for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment would have compared `a` to `b`.

DONE.
