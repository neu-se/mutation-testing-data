  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value of the `next()` method to always return an empty object, rather than an object with a `retain` property. This would cause the `compose()` method to behave differently and potentially produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to the `next()` method to be the op that `thisIter` is currently pointing to, rather than the op that `otherIter` is currently pointing to. This would cause the `compose()` method to behave differently and potentially produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to the `next()` method to be the op that `otherIter` is currently pointing to, rather than the op that `thisIter` is currently pointing to. This would cause the `compose
