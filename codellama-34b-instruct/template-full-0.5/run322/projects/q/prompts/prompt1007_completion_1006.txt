  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `arguments` is a special variable that refers to the arguments passed to a function. Using `array_slice` with `arguments` would create a new array containing a subset of the original arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array containing a subset of the original arguments starting from the second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array containing a subset of the original arguments starting from the third argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.
