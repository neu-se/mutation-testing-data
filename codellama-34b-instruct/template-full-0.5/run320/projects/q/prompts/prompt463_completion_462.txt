  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is a different variable than `reportedUnhandledRejections`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is not the same as an array with elements, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as an array, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

DONE.
