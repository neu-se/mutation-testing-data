  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function(reason) {
  return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason value instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
  return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value plus one instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
  return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value multiplied by two instead of the original value.

DONE.
