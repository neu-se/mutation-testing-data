  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result, so if the property exists, the original code would throw an error, but the modified code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['hasOwnProperty']
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is now a string, so the code would look for a property with the name "hasOwnProperty" instead of a property with the name "hasOwnProperty" followed by a capitalized version of the current property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[Symbol.hasOwnProperty]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Symbol.hasOwnProperty` symbol is used to reference the property, which would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to be called on the `Symbol` object instead of the `object` object.
DONE.
