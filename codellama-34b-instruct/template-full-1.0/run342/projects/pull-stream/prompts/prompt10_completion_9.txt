  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a.length === 1` check ensures that the function has exactly one argument, while `a.length !== 1` would check for any other number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a instanceof Function && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof a === 'function'` check checks if the variable `a` is a function, while `a instanceof Function` checks if the variable `a` is an instance of the `Function` constructor, and the `a.length === 1` check ensures that the function has exactly one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a) && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof a === 'function'` check checks if the variable `a` is a function, while `
