  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft &&
        otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the next operation in the other delta is an insert, which is not checked in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft &&
        otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the next operation in the other delta is a retain, which is not checked in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft &&
        otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result
