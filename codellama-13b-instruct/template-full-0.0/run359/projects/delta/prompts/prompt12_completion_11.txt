  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `b[key]` is undefined, while this code fragment checks if both `a[key]` and `b[key]` are undefined. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, which could indicate a weakness in the test suite.
