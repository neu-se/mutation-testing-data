  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is used instead of the `cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    1
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `1` is used instead of the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is used instead of the `cos` function.

DONE.
