  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `replace` method would not match the same patterns as the original code, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\*/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `replace` method would replace all occurrences of the `*` character, rather than just the ones that are not followed by a `/` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '***')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `replace` method would replace the matched patterns with the string `'***'`, rather than the empty string.

DONE.
