  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different value than `thisOp.delete`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is a different value than `thisOp.delete`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain === 0` is a different condition than `thisOp.delete`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`.

DONE.
