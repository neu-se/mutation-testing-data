 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement `if (-b > x || x > b)` will always return false, causing the Taylor series approximation to be used regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(x) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement `if (-b > x || x > b)` will always return true, causing the Taylor series approximation to be used regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement `if (-b > x || x > b)` will always return false, causing the Taylor series approximation to be used regardless of the input value.

Note: These mutations are intended to change the behavior of the code by introducing incorrect or nonsensical conditions, causing the Taylor series approximation to be used instead of the
