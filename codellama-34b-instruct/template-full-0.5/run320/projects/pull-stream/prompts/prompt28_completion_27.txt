  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1]` is a different value than `ref[0]`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length-1]` is a different value than `ref[0]`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[i]` is a different value than `ref[0]`, which is the original code fragment.

DONE.
