Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url = "http://example.com/"

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.extractFilename = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` module would not be used to extract the file name from the `dest` property, potentially causing the downloaded file to be saved with a different
