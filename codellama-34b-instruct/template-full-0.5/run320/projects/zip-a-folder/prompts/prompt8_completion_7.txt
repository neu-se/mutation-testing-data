  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === src.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string with the first `n` characters of the original string, so `targetBasePath === src.slice(0, -1)` would always be false, even if `targetBasePath` and `src` are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, so `targetBasePath !== src` would always be true, even if `targetBasePath` and `src` are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the string on the left-hand side contains the string on the right-hand side, so `targetBasePath.includes(src)` would always be true, even
