  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with `apply` instead of `Q.denodeify`.

DONE.
