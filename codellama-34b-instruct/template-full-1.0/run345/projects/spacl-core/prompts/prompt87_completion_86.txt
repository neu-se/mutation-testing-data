  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `== null` to check if the result of `rule.query()` is `null`, but this replacement code uses `=== false` to check if the result is exactly `false`. This is a different comparison that may produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `=== null` to check if the result of `rule.query()` is `null`, but this replacement code uses `!== false` to check if the result is not exactly `false`. This is a different comparison that may produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb).asBoolean()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `query()` method to perform the query, but this replacement code uses
