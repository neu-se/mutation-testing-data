  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `options.dest` is an absolute path, regardless of whether it exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `options.dest` is an absolute path, regardless of whether it exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.exists(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `options.dest` is an absolute path and it exists.

DONE.
