  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function receives a doubled value, which could lead to incorrect results when computing the UTC and DST offsets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function receives a value that is half of the `dstOffset`, which could lead to incorrect results when computing the DST offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function receives a value that is the sum of the `utcOffset` and `dstOffset`, which could lead to incorrect results when computing the total offset.

DONE.
