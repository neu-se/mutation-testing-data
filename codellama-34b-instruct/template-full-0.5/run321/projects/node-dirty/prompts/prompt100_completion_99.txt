  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Corrupted row')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the corrupted row in the error message, which would be lost with the replacement code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row: ${rowStr.slice(0, 10)}...`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the entire corrupted row in the error message, while the replacement code only includes the first 10 characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row: ${rowStr.replace(/\n/g, '')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the newline character in the error message, while the replacement code removes it.

DONE.
