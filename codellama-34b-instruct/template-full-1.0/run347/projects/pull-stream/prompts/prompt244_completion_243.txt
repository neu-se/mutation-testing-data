  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(null)` would pass a `null` value as the first argument to the `read` function, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment passes the `err` object as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(err, function(err) {
  cb(err)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would be called with `err` as the first argument, and `cb` as the second argument. This is not the intended behavior, as the anonymous function should be called with `err` as the first argument, and `cb` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function() {
  cb(err)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would be called with `null` as the first argument, and `cb` as the second argument.
