  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return the next op from the list, rather than the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would always be 10, rather than the actual length of the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would always be the next index, rather than the current one.

DONE.
