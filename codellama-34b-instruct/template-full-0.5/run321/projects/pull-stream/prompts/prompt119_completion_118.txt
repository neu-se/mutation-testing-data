  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the accumulated value `acc` as the second argument, while this change calls the callback function with `null` as the second argument, which may not be the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the accumulated value `acc` as the first argument, while this change calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument, which may not be the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the accumulated value `acc` as the first and only argument, while this change calls the callback function with `acc` as the first argument and no second argument, which may not
