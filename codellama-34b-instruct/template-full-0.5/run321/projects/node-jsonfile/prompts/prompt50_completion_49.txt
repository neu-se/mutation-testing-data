  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being used in the original code, and using it in the mutated code would cause the `stringify` function to use a different encoding than the one specified in the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not being used in the original code, and using it in the mutated code would cause the `JSON.parse` function to use a different reviver function than the one specified in the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.fs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs` property is not being used in the original code, and using it in the mutated code would cause the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions to use a different file system
