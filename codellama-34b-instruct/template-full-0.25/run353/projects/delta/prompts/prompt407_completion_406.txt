  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is negated, which would cause the transformation to occur in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the `thisData` and `otherData` parameters is reversed, which would cause the transformation to occur in the opposite order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is set to `true`, which would cause the transformation to occur with higher priority.

DONE.
