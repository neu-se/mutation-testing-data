Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation (`thisOp`) is a delete operation instead of checking if the other operation (`otherOp`) is a delete, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition, causing the code to push `otherOp` when it is not a delete operation, which could lead to unintended retention of operations that should have been ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation (`thisOp`) is a retain operation instead of checking if the other operation (`otherOp`) is a delete, which could result in incorrect logic when transforming operations.

DONE.
