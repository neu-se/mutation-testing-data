  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp at the specified index in the ops array, rather than pushing it onto the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the newOp onto the end of the ops array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unshift the newOp onto the beginning of the ops array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

DONE.
