Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes whitespace from both ends of the string, which could lead to incorrect JSON parsing if the data contains significant whitespace that should be preserved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts all characters in the string to uppercase, which would likely make the JSON invalid if the original data contained lowercase keys or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/"/g, "'")
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all double quotes with single quotes, which would render the JSON invalid, as JSON requires double quotes for strings.

DONE.
