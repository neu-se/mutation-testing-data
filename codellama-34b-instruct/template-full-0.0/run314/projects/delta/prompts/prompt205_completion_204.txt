  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `otherOp.delete` is a number, but the new code fragment checks if `otherOp.delete` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is a number or an object, but the new code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is a number or a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete
