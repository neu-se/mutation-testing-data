  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the given function's context. In the original code, `uncurryThis` is used to create a new function that is bound to the `Array.prototype.slice` function's context, which allows the `slice` function to be called without specifying the `this` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the given function's context. In the original code, `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)` is used to create a new function that is bound to the `Array.prototype.slice` function's context, which allows the `slice` function to be called without specifying
