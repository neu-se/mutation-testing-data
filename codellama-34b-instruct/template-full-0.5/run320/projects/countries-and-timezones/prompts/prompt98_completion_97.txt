  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is equal to `true`, while this alternative code fragment checks if it is not equal to `true`. If `deprecated` is `false`, the original code fragment would return the `tzs` object, while this alternative code fragment would return an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is equal to `true`, while this alternative code fragment checks if it is not equal to `false`. If `deprecated` is `false`, the original code fragment would return the `tzs` object, while this alternative code fragment would return an empty object.
