  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is equal to `undefined`, which is not the same as checking if it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is equal to `null`, which is not the same as checking if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is falsy, which is not the same as checking if it is truthy.

DONE.
