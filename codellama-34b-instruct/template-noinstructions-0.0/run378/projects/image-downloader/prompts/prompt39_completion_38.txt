  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is used to resolve the promise with a value, while the `reject` function is used to reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is used to resolve the promise with a value, while the `resolve(null)` function is used to resolve the promise with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is used to resolve the promise with a value, while the `resolve(new Error('Error message'))` function is used to resolve the promise with an error object.

DONE.
