  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return a different value for the line number, which would affect the filtering of stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `null` for the line number, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they match the expected format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `undefined` for the line number, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they match the expected format.

DONE.
