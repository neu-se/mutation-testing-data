  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ices$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches words that end in "-ices," which are already in the plural form, rather than words that end in "-ics." This would cause the rule to apply to the wrong set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches words that end in "-ics," but does not match words that end in "-ices." This would cause the rule to apply to a different set of words than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/i$|ces$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches words that end in "-i" or "-ces," which are both already in the plural form. This would cause the rule to apply to the wrong set of words.

DONE.
