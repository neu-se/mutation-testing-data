 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the imaginary part is greater than or equal to 0, instead of less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['re'] <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the real part of the result instead of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(res['im']) <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the absolute value of the imaginary part is less than or equal to 0, which is never the case since the absolute value of a non-zero number is always positive.

DONE.
