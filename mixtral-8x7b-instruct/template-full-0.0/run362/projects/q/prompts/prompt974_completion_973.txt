 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current promise object, which is not what we want in this case. The original code fragment, `object`, refers to the first argument passed to the `npost` or `ninvoke` method, which is the object that has the named method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `object` would cause an error when trying to access the method of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is the constructor function for the Q promise library, and passing it instead of `object` would cause an error when trying to access the method of `Q`.

DONE.
