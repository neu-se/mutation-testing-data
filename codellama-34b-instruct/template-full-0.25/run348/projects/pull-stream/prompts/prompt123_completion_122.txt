  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `end` is not greater than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `end` is greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable is being used in the `if` statement instead of the `end` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `max` is greater than `end`, even if `end` is greater than `max`.

DONE.
