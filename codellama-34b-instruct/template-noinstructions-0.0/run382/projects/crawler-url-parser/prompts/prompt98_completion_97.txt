  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) || urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the URL is already in the map, while this modified code also checks if the text of the URL is already in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && !urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the URL is already in the map, while
