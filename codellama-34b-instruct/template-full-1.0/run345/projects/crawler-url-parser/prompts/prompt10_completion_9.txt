  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = <PLACEHOLDER>(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified from `/^\/\//` to `/^\/\//^`, which would match a different pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = <PLACEHOLDER>(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string has been changed from `http://` to `https://`, which would result in a different URL being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = <PLACEHOLDER>(/^\/\//, 'https://www.example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string has been changed from `http://` to `https://www.example.com`, which would result in a different URL being generated.

DONE.
