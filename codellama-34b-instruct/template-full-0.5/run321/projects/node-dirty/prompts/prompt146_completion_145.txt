  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drained'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'drained' is not a valid event name in the `Dirty` class, and would cause the `emit` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to emit a different event name, which would not be handled by any of the event listeners in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to emit a different event name, which would not be handled by any of the event listeners in the code.

DONE.
