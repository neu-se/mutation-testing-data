  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(ops)` checks if `ops` is an array, while `ops.length > 0` checks if `ops` has a length greater than 0. If `ops` is not an array, but has a length property, the latter expression would evaluate to `true`, while the former would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(ops)` checks if `ops` is an array, while `ops.length === 0` checks if `ops` has a length of 0. If `ops` is not an array, but has a length property, the latter expression would evaluate to `false`, while the former would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior
