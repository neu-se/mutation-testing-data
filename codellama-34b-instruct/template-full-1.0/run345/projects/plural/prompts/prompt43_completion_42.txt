  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(-2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr(-2)` would return the last two characters of the string, whereas `w.length - 2` would return the length of the string minus 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.charAt(w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.charAt(w.length - 2)` would return the character at the index of `w.length - 2`, whereas `w.substr(-2)` would return the last two characters of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(-2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice(-2)` would return the last two characters of the string, whereas `w.substr(-2)` would return the length of the string minus 2.

DONE.
