 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be fulfilled with `undefined`, instead of using the original promise's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be rejected with the message 'An error occurred', instead of using the original promise's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be fulfilled with a random number between 0 and 1, instead of using the original promise's value.

DONE.
