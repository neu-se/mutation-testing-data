  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` will delete the characters in the delta, whereas `delta.retain` will retain the characters in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { color: 'red' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` with an attribute map will retain the characters in the delta with the specified attribute, whereas `delta.retain` without an attribute map will retain the characters in the delta without any attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { color: 'blue' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` with a different attribute map will retain the characters in the delta with a different attribute, whereas `delta.retain` without an attribute map will retain the characters in the delta without any attributes.

DONE.
