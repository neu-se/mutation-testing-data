  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not
defined in the context of the original code fragment, which uses
`arguments` to refer to the function arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a space character
is not a valid function argument, and using it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the number 42 is not
a valid function argument, and using it would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
