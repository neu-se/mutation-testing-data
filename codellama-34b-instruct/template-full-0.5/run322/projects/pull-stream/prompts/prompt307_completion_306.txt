  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function is not called when `last` is `true`, which could cause the stream to not be properly terminated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function is not called when `last` is `false`, which could cause the stream to not be properly terminated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function is called when `last` is `true`, which could cause the stream to be terminated prematurely.

DONE.
