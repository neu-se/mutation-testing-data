 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the rule[0] (match pattern) to a string, which will not have the same behavior as the original 'type' function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test.bind(rule[0])
