  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` always rounds to the nearest integer, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating point number converted to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.parseInt` only parses the integer part of the number, whereas `parseFloat` returns the full floating point number converted to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode` converts an ASCII code to a string, whereas `parseFloat` converts a string representation of a number to a floating point number.

DONE.
