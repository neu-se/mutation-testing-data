  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `verb` string starting from the second character, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `verb` string, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
