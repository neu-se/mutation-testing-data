  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.message` is a string, while `err` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, while `err` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, while `err` is an object.

DONE.
