  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This code fragment is similar to `Object.keys`, but it returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, instead of the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This code fragment is similar to `Object.keys`, but it returns an array of the key-value pairs of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, instead of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This code fragment returns an array of the own property names of the object, including non-enumerable properties.

DONE.
