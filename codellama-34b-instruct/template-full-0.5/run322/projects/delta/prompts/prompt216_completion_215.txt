  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation in the other Delta, which could affect the outcome of the concat method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate the first operation in the other Delta, which could affect the outcome of the concat method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate the last operation in the other Delta, which could affect the outcome of the concat method.

DONE.
