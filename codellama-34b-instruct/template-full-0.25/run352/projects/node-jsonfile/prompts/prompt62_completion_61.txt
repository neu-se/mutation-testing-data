  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the content string starting from the second character, whereas the original code fragment would return the entire content string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the content string in uppercase, whereas the original code fragment would return the content string as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of individual characters in the content string, whereas the original code fragment would return the content string as is.

DONE.
