  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the stack trace starting from the second character instead of from the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the stack trace starting from the third character instead of from the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the stack trace starting from the fourth character instead of from the first character.

DONE.
