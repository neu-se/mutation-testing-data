  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a number, whereas `otherOp.attributes` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a string, whereas `otherOp.attributes` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData` is the data stored in the `Data` object, whereas `otherOp.attributes` is an object.

DONE.
