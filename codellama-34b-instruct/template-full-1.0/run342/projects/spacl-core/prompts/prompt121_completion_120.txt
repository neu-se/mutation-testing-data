  Options 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `ctx.path`

This would result in different behavior because it would use the `path` property of the `ctx` object, which may not be present or may have a different value than the `path` argument.
```
if (this.matches(ctx.path, ctx) && verb in this.verbs) {
  return this.verbs[verb]
}
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `ctx.getProp(this.regex.props[index])`

```
if (this.matches(path.split("/")[index], ctx) && verb in this.verbs) {
  return this.verbs[verb]
}
```
