  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression `read + 1, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]` would be evaluated as `(read + 1), ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]`, which is not the same as `read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]`.

DONE.
