  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `callback` function, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed, which could cause issues if the `callback` function expects a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `callback` function, which could cause issues if the function expects a specific number of arguments.

DONE.
