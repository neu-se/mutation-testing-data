Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled || rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `progress` handler, which means that any progress notifications will not be handled, potentially leading to unresponsive behavior in scenarios where progress updates are important.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled && rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical AND operator, which will only execute the promise chain if both `fulfilled` and `rejected` are truthy, effectively ignoring the promise resolution if either is falsy, leading to unexpected promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the promise chain to only handle rejections through the `catch` method, which may not properly handle fulfilled values, potentially causing the promise to not resolve as expected.

DONE.
