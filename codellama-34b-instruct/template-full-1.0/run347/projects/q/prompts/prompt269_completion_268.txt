  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log
```
This would result in different behavior because `log` is a function that outputs data to the console log, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 removesloppyequalitymatch from .thenreject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject if the resolution value matches a specified value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (messages)
{
resolvedPromise = new Error();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error if `messages` is not empty, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with the given reason.
