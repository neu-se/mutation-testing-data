  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered resolved, even if it was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered unresolved, even if it was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled" && inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered resolved, but the value would be undefined, even if it was fulfilled with a value.

DONE.
