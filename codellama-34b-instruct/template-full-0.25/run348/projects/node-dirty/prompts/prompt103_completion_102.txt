  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value associated with the key, whereas `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the key before using it, which could result in a different key being used for the lookup.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 'suffix'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a suffix to the key before using it, which could result in a different key being used for the lookup.

DONE.
