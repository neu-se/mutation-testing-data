  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a country object, as the `tzName` parameter is not a valid timezone name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a country object for the UTC timezone, instead of the timezone specified by the `tzName` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"America/New_York"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a country object for the America/New_York timezone, instead of the timezone specified by the `tzName` parameter.

DONE.
