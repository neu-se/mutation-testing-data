Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if `linkurl_path` begins with `pageurl_path`, which is a stricter condition than `includes`, potentially missing valid cases where `pageurl_path` is a substring of `linkurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because using `indexOf` with a comparison to `-1` checks if `pageurl_path` is not found in `linkurl_path`, which would invert the logic of the original `includes` check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.length > pageurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because this condition checks if `linkurl_path` is longer than `pageurl_path`, which does not relate to the original intent of checking for containment, thus leading to incorrect categorization of URL levels.

DONE.
