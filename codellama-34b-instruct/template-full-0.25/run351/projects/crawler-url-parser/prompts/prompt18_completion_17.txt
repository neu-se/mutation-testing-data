  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while this replacement checks the length of the string. If `baseUrlStr` is an empty string, the original code would evaluate to `true`, while this replacement would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while this replacement checks if the lowercase version of `baseUrlStr` is truthy. If `baseUrlStr` is an empty string, the original code would evaluate to `true`, while this replacement would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `baseUrlStr` is truthy, while
