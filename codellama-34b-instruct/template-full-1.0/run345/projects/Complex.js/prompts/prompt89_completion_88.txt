  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` will return a new float value, whereas `parseFloat()` will return a new string value, even if the input value is already a float.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` will return a new number value, whereas `parseFloat()` will return a new string value, even if the input value is already a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a numeric literal, whereas `parseFloat()` is a function, and multiplying a string value by `1` will attempt to coerce it to a number, whereas `parseFloat()` will always return a string value.

DONE.
