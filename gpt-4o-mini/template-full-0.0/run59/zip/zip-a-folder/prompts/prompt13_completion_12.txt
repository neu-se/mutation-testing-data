Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./nonexistent_directory'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always throw a permission error when trying to access a non-existent directory, regardless of the actual `src` path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + '/extra_path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `src` path by appending an additional directory, which may lead to a failure in accessing the intended source directory if it does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to convert the `src` string to uppercase, which will likely cause a failure in accessing the directory since file paths are case-sensitive on many operating systems.

DONE.
