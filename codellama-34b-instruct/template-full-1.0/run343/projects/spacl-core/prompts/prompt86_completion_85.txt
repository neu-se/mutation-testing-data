  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.clone` is a method that creates a clone of the `rule` object, but `rule.clone.call(null)` would call the method with `null` as the `this` context, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone().push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.clone()` creates a clone of the `rule` object, but `push()` is a method that modifies the object's state by adding a new element to the array of rules, and would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone().pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.clone()` creates a clone of the `rule` object, and `pop()` is a method that removes the last element of an array, so it would remove the last
