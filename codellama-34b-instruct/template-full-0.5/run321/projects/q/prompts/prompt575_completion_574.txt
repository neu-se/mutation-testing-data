  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `undefined`, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `null`, which would also throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the string "foo", which would also throw an error.

DONE.
