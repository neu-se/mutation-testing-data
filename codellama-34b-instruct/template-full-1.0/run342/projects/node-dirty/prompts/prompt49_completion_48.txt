  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the updater function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to the `set` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(0, this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the updater function immediately with the incorrect arguments, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key), this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the updater function immediately with the same argument twice, which would likely have unintended consequences.

DONE.
