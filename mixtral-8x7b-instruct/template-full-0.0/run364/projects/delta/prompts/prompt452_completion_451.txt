 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` checks if the current operation's length is greater than 0, while `hasNext` checks if the index is less than the length of the operations array. This change would cause the Iterator to return an empty array for the `rest` method when the current operation has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.index < this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` checks if the index is less than the length of the operations array, while this check directly compares the index with the length of the array minus 1. This change would cause the Iterator to return an empty array for the `rest` method when the current operation is the last one in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.length -
