  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less-than operator, which excludes the upper bound of the loop, while the replacement code fragment uses the less-than-or-equal-to operator, which includes the upper bound of the loop. This would cause the loop to iterate one additional time, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. DONE.
