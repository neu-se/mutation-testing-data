Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
id === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `id` is `null` instead of not `null`, which would lead to incorrect tracking of already imported modules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
id !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `id` is not `undefined` instead of not `null`, which could lead to different results if `id` can be `undefined` but not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof id !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `id` instead of checking if it's `null`, which would incorrectly assume that all non-string `id`s are valid and should be tracked.

DONE.
