  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is less than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is less than or equal to `max`.

DONE.
