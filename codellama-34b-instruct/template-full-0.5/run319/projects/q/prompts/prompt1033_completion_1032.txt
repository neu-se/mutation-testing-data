  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the error object to the nodeback function, while this code fragment throws the error object as an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object as the first argument to the nodeback function, while this code fragment passes it as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback("error", error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object as the first argument to the nodeback function, while this code fragment passes a string "error" as the first argument and the error object as the second argument.

DONE.
