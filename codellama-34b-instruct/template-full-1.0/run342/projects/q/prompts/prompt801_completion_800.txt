  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, it was passing `undefined` as the `errback` argument to `promise.then`, while now it would be passing the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, it was passing `undefined` as the `errback` argument to `promise.then`, while now it would be passing the boolean `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { throw new Error("intentional error") })
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, it was passing `undefined` as the `errback` argument to `promise.then`, while now it would be passing a function that throws an error.

DONE.
