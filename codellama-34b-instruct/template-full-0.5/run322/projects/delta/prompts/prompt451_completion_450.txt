  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more ops available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more ops available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more ops available.

DONE.
