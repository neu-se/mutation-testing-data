  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = newOp.attributes || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while the new code always sets it to an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, newOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while the new code always creates a new object and assigns it to `newOp.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...newOp.attributes };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while the new code always creates a new object and assigns it to `newOp.attributes`.

DONE.
