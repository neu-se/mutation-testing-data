Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly identify the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly identify the root directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because this function would always return the root directory ('/'), regardless of the actual path. This change would cause the function to incorrectly identify the root directory and potentially lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
