  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var hasOwnProperty = {}.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different object as the receiver of the `hasOwnProperty` method, which can cause the function to return different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replacer` as a function, but this replacement would convert it to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replacer` as a function, but this replacement would call it without any arguments, which can cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
