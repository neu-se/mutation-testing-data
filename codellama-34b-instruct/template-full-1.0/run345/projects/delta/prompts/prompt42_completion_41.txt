  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0xffff)
```
This would result in different behavior because 0xffff is not a valid character code, and would produce a Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) instead of a null character (U+0000).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a valid character code, and would produce a null character (U+0000) instead of the expected Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode('')
```
This would result in different behavior because '' is not a valid character code, and would produce an error instead of a null character (U+0000).

DONE.
