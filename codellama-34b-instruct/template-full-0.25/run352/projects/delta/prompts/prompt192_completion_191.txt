  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate early if the peeked length is 0, even if there are still ops left in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate early if the peeked op is a delete, even if there are still ops left in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate early if the peeked length is negative, even if there are still ops left in the iterator.

DONE.
