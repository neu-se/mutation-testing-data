Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the uppercase version of the pattern is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the pattern contains case-sensitive glob characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the pattern with an appended wildcard character is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the original pattern was not intended to be a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ESCAPE_SYMBOL + pattern
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the pattern with an escaped character at the beginning is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the pattern was intended to be a literal string.

DONE.
