  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is not the same as the `options` object, and it may not have the same properties or methods as the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest.pathname` property is not the same as the `options.dest` property, and it may not have the same value or behavior as the `options.dest` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url.pathname` property is not the same as the `options.url` property, and it may not have the same value or behavior as the `options.url` property.

DONE.
