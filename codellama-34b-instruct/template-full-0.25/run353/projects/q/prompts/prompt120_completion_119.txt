  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has a property with the given name. By using `call`, we are binding the function to the object and checking if the object has the property `prop`. This would result in a different behavior than the original code, which was checking if the object has the property `prop` using the `in` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(this, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(this, prop)` is a bound function that checks if an object has a property with the given name. This would result in a different behavior than the original code, which was checking if the object has the property `prop` using the `in` operator.
