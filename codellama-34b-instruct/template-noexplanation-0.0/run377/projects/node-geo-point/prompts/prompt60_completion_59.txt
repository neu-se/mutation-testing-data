  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the wrong value, as it will use the cosine of the angle instead of the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the wrong value, as it will use the tangent of the angle instead of the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the wrong value, as it will use the arccosine of the angle instead of the sine.

DONE.
