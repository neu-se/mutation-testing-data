  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of whether `console.warn` is a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether `console` is defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether `console.warn` is a function or not.

DONE.
