  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` signal is not being passed to the `_read` function, which could cause the stream to remain open and continue reading data even after it has been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is only being called if the `abort` signal is `true`, which could cause the stream to remain open and continue reading data even after it has been aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, function() { cb(abort) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with the `abort` signal as its argument, which could cause it to be treated as a normal function instead of a callback function.

DONE.
