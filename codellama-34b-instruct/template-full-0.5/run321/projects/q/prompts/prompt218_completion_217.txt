  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(undefined)` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(new Error())` would cause the promise to be resolved with an error value, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with the value `value`.

DONE.
