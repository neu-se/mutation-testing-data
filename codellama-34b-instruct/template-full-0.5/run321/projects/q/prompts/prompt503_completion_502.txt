  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this context, `null` would be interpreted as a function argument, which could cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value, just like `void 0`. However, `undefined` is a more explicit and readable way to express this concept, and it is the preferred way to represent the absence of a value in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which could cause the code to behave differently if the `args` array is modified during the execution of the code.

DONE.
