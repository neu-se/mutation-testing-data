  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `1`, rather than the actual number of keys in the database, which could cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the wrong number of keys.
