  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the peeked operation in the other iterator, which could cause the code to skip over a portion of the other delta's operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the peeked operation in the this iterator, which could cause the code to include an extra operation in the diff result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the length of the peeked operation in the other iterator by 2, which could cause the code to include twice as many operations in the diff result.

DONE.
