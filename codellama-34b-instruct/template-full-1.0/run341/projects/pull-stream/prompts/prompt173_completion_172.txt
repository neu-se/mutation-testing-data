  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, while `Array.isObject` checks if the argument is an object. Using `Array.isObject` would cause the code to produce incorrect results in cases where the argument is not an array but an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(array) === false` would cause the code to produce incorrect results in cases where the argument is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray` would cause the code to produce incorrect results in cases where the argument is an array.

DONE.
