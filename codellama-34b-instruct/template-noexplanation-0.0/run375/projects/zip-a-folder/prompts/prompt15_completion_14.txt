  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This change will cause the `access` method to check for write permissions instead of read permissions, which may cause the test to fail if the test is expecting read-only access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This change will cause the `access` method to check for execute permissions instead of read permissions, which may cause the test to fail if the test is expecting read-only access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This change will cause the `access` method to check for the existence of the file instead of read permissions, which may cause the test to fail if the test is expecting read-only access.

DONE.
