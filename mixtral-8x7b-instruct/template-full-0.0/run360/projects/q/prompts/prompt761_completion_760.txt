 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array, so any modifications to the original `promises` array will not affect the processed array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.filter(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any falsy values from the `promises` array, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with all the elements of the original `promises` array, but it also adds a single, empty element to the new array. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the `allResolved` function.

DONE.
