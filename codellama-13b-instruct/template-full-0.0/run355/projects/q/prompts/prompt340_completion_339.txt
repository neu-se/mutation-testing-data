  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" ||
                inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is in a "pending" or "rejected" state, while the new code fragment checks if the promise is in a "pending" or "fulfilled" state. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected in a different way than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" ||
                inspected.state === "rejected" ||
                inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is in a "pending" or "rejected" state, while the new code fragment checks if the promise is in a "pending", "rejected", or "fulfilled" state. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected in a different way than intended.
