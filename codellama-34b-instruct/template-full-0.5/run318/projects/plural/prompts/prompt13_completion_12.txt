  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of the original word, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of the original word, starting from the specified position and continuing to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a substring of the original word, starting from the specified position and continuing to the end of the word, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of the original word, starting from the specified position and continuing for the specified number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'` would return a substring of the original word, starting from the first character and continuing
