  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` by `firstOther.retain - firstLeft` positions, which could cause the `otherIter` to skip over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` by `firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1` positions, which could cause the `otherIter` to skip over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` by `firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1` positions, which could cause the `otherIter` to skip over important operations.
