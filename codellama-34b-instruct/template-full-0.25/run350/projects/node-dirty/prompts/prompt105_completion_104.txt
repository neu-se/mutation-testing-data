  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value associated with the key, while `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(row.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(row.key)` would return the value associated with the key, while `row.key` would return the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + 1` would return a different key than the original key, while `row.key` would return the original key.

DONE.
