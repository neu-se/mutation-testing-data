  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any text after the hash symbol (#) in the URL, while this new code fragment replaces the hash symbol with a space. This could potentially cause the URL to be parsed differently, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any text after the hash symbol (#) in the URL, while this new code fragment removes the hash symbol and any text after it. This could potentially cause the URL to be parsed differently, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any text after the hash symbol (#) in the URL, while this new code fragment replaces the hash symbol with the string "http://". This could potentially cause the URL to be parsed differently
