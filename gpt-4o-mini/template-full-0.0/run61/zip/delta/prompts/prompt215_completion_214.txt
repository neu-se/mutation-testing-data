Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(...other.ops.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `delta.ops` array by pushing the elements of `other.ops` instead of concatenating them, which could lead to an incorrect state of the `delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops = other.ops.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely replaces `delta.ops` with the sliced `other.ops`, losing any previous operations in `delta`, which would not be the intended behavior of concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates `other.ops` to `delta.ops` instead of just the sliced version, potentially including the first operation of `other.ops` again, which could lead to duplication of operations in the `delta`.

DONE.
