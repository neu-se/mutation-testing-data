 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `indexOf` method of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the `array_indexOf` utility function. This could lead to issues if the `unhandledRejections` array contains non-integer keys or has a custom `indexOf` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].indexOf.bind(unhandledRejections)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `bind` method to create a new function with `this` set to the `unhandledRejections` array. This could lead to issues if the `unhandledRejections` array is later modified, as the bound function will still reference the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(i => unhandledRejections.indexOf(i))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a lambda function that
