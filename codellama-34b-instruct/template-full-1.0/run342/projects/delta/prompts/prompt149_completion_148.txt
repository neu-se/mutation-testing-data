  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would never be satisfied, as the `firstOther.retain - firstLeft` operation would always result in a positive value. As a result, the `otherIter.next` method would never be called, which would prevent the algorithm from correctly handling the composition of the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be satisfied, as the `otherIter.peekLength` method would always return a value less than or equal to `firstLeft`. As a result, the `otherIter.next` method would never be called, which would prevent the algorithm from correctly handling the composition of the two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft >= otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition
