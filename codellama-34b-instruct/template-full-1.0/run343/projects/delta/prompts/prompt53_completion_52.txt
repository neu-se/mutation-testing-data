  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Object.keys(a).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `embedType` key exists on the `a` object, whereas this change checks if the `a` object has any keys at all.
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    !Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is an array, whereas this change checks if `a` is not an array.
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    a.embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `embedType` key on the `b` object is the same as the `embedType` key on the `a` object, whereas this change checks if the `embedType` key on the `b` object is different from the `embedType` key on the `a`
