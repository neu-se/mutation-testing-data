  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different operation name, which would likely have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"push"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different operation name, which would likely have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pop"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different operation name, which would likely have a different implementation or behavior.

DONE.
