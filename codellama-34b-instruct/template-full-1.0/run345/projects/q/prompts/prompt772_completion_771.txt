  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.allSettled(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
The `allSettled` method is only available on instances of Q, and the `<PLACEHOLDER>` was meant to be a placeholder for the `promises` variable. Replacing it with `promises.allSettled(promises)` would create a recursive call to the `allSettled` method, causing a "maximum call stack size exceeded" error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.allResolved(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was:
```
return Q(promises).allResolved(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
The `allResolved` method is only available on instances of Q, and the `<PLACEHOLDER>` was
