Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the content of the file to uppercase, which would likely cause `JSON.parse` to fail if the original content is not in uppercase JSON format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 'extra data'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a string to the data, which would make the JSON invalid, leading to a parsing error in `JSON.parse`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the string content of the file, which would also likely result in invalid JSON when passed to `JSON.parse`.

DONE.
