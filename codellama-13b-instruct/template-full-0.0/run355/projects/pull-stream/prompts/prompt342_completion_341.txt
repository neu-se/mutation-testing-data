  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls it with the `abort` argument. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently depending on whether it is called with or without the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the `abort` argument, while this code fragment calls it with the result of the ternary expression `abort === true ? null: abort`. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently depending on whether the `abort` argument is `true` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb
