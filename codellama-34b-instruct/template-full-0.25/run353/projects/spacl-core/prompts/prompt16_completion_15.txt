  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative lookahead assertion `(?!$)` ensures that the match does not end at the end of the string, which is not the case with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!$|[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-])/
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative lookahead assertion `(?!$|[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-])` ensures that the match does not end at the end of the string or at a character that is not in the set of allowed characters, which is not the case with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!$|[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-])|[a-
