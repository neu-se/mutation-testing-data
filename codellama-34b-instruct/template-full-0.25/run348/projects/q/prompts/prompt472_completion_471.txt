  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `splice` removes the element at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice` removes the element at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would empty the array, whereas `splice` only removes the element at a specific index.

DONE.
