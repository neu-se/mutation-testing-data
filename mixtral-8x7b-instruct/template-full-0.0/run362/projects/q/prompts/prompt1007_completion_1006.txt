 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the actual implementation of `array_slice`, but using it directly would bypass any potential overrides or monkey-patching of the `array_slice` function in the project's codebase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is the original method from which `array_slice` is a shim for cross-browser compatibility. Using `Array.prototype.slice` directly might not work in older browsers that don't support the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qEndingLine.line
```
This would result in different behavior because `qEndingLine.line` is the line where the `qEndingLine` variable was assigned using `captureLine()`. This line number might not be a suitable replacement for `
