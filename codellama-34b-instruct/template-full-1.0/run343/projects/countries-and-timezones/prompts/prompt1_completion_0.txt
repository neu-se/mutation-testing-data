  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `name` variable is falsy, which includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, `''`, and `false`. On the other hand, `!name.length` checks if the length of the `name` variable is falsy, which means it will only return `true` if the length of `name` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, which includes `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `NaN`, `''`, and `false`. On the other hand, `name === undefined` checks if `name` is exactly equal to `undefined`, which means it will only return `true` if `name` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(name)
