  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current element in the stream being processed, while `data + 1` would be a reference to the next element in the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current element in the stream being processed, while `data - 1` would be a reference to the previous element in the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current element in the stream being processed, while `data * 2` would be a reference to the current element in the stream multiplied by 2.

DONE.
