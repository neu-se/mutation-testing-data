  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort()` is a function, and the original code fragment was just a string. This change would cause the `read` function to be called with the `abort` function as an argument, instead of the `abort` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as the `abort` string. If the `read` function is called with `null` as an argument, it may not produce the same results as calling it with the `abort` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"aborted"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"aborted"` is not the same as the `abort` string. If the `read` function is called with `"aborted"` as an argument, it may not produce the same results as calling it with the `abort` string.
