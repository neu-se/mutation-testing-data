  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while the new code fragment checks if it is not defined. This change would cause the `requestTick` function to be assigned a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
