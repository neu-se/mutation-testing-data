  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This change will cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string than it would have with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This change will cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string than it would have with the original code fragment, because it will use the `dstOffset` variable instead of the `utcOffset` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This change will cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string than it would have with the original code fragment, because it will pass a different value to the `getOffsetStr` function.

DONE.
