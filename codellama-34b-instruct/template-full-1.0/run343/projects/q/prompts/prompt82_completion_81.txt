  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it can be passed as an argument to a function without causing an error. In contrast, `task` is not a valid value in this context, and it would cause an error when passed as an argument to `nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it can be passed as an argument to a function without causing an error. In contrast, `task` is not a valid value in this context, and it would cause an error when passed as an argument to `nextTick`.

This would result in different behavior because `123` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it can be passed as an argument to a function without causing an error. In contrast, `task` is not a valid value in
