  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never run, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run once, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
