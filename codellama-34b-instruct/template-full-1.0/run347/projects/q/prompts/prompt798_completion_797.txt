  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(ms, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and an error would be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.timeout(ms, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object is not defined in the provided code snippet, and an error would be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().timeout(ms, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and an error would be thrown.

DONE.
