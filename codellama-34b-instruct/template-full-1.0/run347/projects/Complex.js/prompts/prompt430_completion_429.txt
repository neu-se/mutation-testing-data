  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method rounds down to the nearest integer, while the `ceil` method rounds up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the `round` method rounds to the nearest integer, while the `ceil` method rounds up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method returns the absolute value of the input, while the `ceil` method rounds up.

DONE.
