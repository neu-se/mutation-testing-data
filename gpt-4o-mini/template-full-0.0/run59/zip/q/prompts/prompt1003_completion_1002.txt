Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, which could lead to incorrect method calls on the object, as the method name would be passed as the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the method name with `null`, which would cause the dispatch to fail since it would not be able to find a method to call on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `nodeArgs` with an empty array, meaning no arguments would be passed to the method, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors if the method requires arguments.

DONE.
