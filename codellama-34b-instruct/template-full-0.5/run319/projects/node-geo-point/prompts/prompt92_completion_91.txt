  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(Î¸)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range and output than the `cos` function, which could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is not related to the calculation of the bearing and would cause the method to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.latitude` property is not related to the calculation of the bearing and would cause the method to return incorrect values.

DONE.
