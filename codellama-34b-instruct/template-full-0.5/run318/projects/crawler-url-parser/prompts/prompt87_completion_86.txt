  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `text()` method to get the text content of the element, while this code fragment uses the `text` property to get the trimmed text content of the element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `text()` method to get the text content of the element, while this code fragment uses the `html()` method to get the trimmed HTML content of the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim() + " " + $(this).html().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `text()` method to get the text content of the element, while this code fragment uses the `text()` method to get the trimmed text content of the element and then concatenates it with the
