```
    undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called.

DONE.
