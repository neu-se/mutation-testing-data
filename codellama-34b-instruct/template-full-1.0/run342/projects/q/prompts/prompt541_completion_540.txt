  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passed `void 0` as the `this` argument to `fulfilled.apply()`, while using `this` would pass the surrounding context as the `this` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passed `void 0` as the `this` argument to `fulfilled.apply()`, while using `null` would pass `null` as the `this` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passed `void 0` as the `this` argument to `fulfilled.apply()`, while using `42` would pass `42` as the `this` argument.

DONE.
