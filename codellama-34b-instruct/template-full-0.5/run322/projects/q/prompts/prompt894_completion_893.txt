  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` would return the same shallow copy but with the elements in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(["dummy"])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(["dummy"])` would return a new array that is a concatenation of the original array and the string "dummy", while `array_slice` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(value, index) { return index % 2 === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(value, index) { return index % 2 === 0; })` would return a new array that contains only
