  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `Math.pow()` function return `Infinity` when `places` is 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `Math.pow()` function return `NaN` when `places` is 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `Math.pow()` function return `undefined` when `places` is 0, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
