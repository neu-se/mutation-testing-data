  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a function, and checking if it's equal to `null` would always return `false`, meaning that `nextChunk()` would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a function, and checking if it's not equal to `null` would always return `true`, meaning that `nextChunk()` would always be called, even if `_read` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a function, and checking if its length is equal to 0 would always return `false`, meaning that `nextChunk()` would never be called.

DONE.
