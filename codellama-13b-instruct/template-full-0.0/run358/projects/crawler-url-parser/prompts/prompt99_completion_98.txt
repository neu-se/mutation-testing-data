  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property, whereas `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property and it is not inherited from its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value of the property with the specified name, whereas `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method sets the value of the property with the specified name, whereas `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property.

DONE.
