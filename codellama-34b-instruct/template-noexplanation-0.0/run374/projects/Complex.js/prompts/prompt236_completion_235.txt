  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different sign in the expression for `r`. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different expression for `r`. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different expression for `r`. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
