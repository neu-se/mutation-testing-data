  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random longitude value, potentially causing the `calculateDistance` function to return an incorrect distance value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value instead of the longitude value, potentially causing the `calculateDistance` function to return an incorrect distance value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the longitude value, potentially causing the `calculateDistance` function to return an incorrect distance value.

DONE.
