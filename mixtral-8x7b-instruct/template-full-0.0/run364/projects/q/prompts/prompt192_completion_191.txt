 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"[object GlobalError]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the string comparison for identifying a Node.js error, potentially causing incorrect stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a global flag (g) to the regular expression, causing it to match all occurrences instead of stopping at the first match, which might lead to incorrect filename and line number extraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
