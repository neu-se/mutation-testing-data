  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is called on `point2.longitude` instead of `point1.longitude`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is called on `point2.longitude` instead of `point1.longitude`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2.longitude` value is used directly instead of being converted to radians using the `deg2rad` function, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
