  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` and `sin` have different outputs for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin()` is not a function in JavaScript, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a built-in function in JavaScript that computes the sine of a number in radians, whereas `sin` is a constant in the code snippet.

DONE.
