  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than it should, potentially missing a necessary iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than it should, potentially causing an error or undefined behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate half as many times as it should, potentially missing important iterations or causing unnecessary iterations.

DONE.
