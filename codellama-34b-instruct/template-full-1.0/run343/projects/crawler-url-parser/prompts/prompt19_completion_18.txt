  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + 'http://';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses ".replace()" to modify the baseUrlStr, while this code appends 'http://' to the end of the string, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr / 'http://';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses ".replace()" to modify the baseUrlStr, while this code performs a division operation on the string, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.concat('http');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses ".replace()" to modify the baseUrlStr, while this code concatenates the string 'http' to the end of baseUrlStr, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
