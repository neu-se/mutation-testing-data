Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the base index by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping over an operation in the base slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the base index, which could lead to accessing an invalid or unintended operation in the base slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + op.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the `retain` property of the operation instead of a constant increment, which could lead to incorrect indexing based on the operation's data structure.

DONE.
