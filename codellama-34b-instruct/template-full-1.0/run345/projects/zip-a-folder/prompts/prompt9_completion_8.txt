  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the `isGlob` function, which means that the `if` statement would only be executed when `src` is not a glob. If `src` is a glob, the program would try to access the file system, which may result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (src.indexOf('.') === -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` function is checking if the string `src` contains the character `.` anywhere. If `src` does contain the character `.`, the program would try to access the file system, which may result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (path.extname(src) === '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname` function is checking if the string `src` has an extension or not.
