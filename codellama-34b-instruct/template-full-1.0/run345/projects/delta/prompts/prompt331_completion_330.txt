  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0][1].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a different element in the `other.ops` array, potentially leading to a different value being used in the transformation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = new OpIterator(base.ops); newOp.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `OpIterator` object and then call the `next()` method on it, potentially leading to different behavior if the `other.ops` array contains different elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1][1].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a different element in the `other.ops` array, potentially leading to a different value being used in the transformation.

DONE.
