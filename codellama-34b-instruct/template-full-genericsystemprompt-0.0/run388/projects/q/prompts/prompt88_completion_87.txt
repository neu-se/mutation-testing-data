  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment `[1, 2, 3]` is a hardcoded array of numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment `"hello"` is a hardcoded string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function, while the new code fragment `null` is a hardcoded null value.

DONE.
