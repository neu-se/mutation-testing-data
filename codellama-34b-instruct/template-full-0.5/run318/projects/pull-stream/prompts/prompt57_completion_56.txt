  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `item` variable onto the `arr` array, while this mutation pushes the result of `item + 1` onto the array, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `item` variable onto the `arr` array, while this mutation pushes the result of `item - 1` onto the array, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `item` variable onto the `arr` array, while this mutation pushes the result of `item * 2` onto the array, which is a different value.

DONE.
