  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the offset is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if the offset is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `rest()` method to return a different result if the offset is not 0, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `Iterator` class.

DONE.
