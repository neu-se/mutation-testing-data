  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosδ - sinφ1 * sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the angular distance, while the new code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the latitude of the second point. This would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
