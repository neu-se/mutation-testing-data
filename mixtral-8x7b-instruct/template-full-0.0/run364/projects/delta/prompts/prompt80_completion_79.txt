 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null equality instead of checking if `lastOp` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof lastOp !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `lastOp` is not undefined, rather than checking if it's an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `lastOp` is an array, which is not the same as checking if it's an object.

DONE.
