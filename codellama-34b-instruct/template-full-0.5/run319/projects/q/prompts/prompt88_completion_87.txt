  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array, and `Array.prototype.slice()` would throw an error when called on `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and `Array.prototype.slice()` would throw an error when called on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is not the same as the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
