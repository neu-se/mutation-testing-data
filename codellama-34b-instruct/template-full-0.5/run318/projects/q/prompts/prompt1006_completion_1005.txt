  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `object` variable, which may have a specific value or reference, while the replacement code fragment uses the `null` value, which has a different behavior in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `object` variable, which may have a specific value or reference, while the replacement code fragment uses the `undefined` value, which has a different behavior in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `object` variable, which may have a specific value or reference, while the replacement code fragment uses the `this` value, which has a different behavior in the context of the surrounding code.

DONE.
