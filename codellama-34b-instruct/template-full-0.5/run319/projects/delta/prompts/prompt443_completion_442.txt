  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the length of the substring. If the start position is 0, the method will return an empty string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the length of the substring. If the start position is `length - 1`, the method will return a substring that is one character shorter than the original string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the length of the substring. If the start position is `length + 1`, the method will return a substring that is one
