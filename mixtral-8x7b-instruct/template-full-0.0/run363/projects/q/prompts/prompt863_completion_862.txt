 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be twice as long as intended, which could cause issues if the code relies on the delay being a specific length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be instantaneous, which could cause issues if the code relies on the delay being a certain length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay function would receive a null value instead of a number, which could cause a TypeError or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
