  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two objects are the same, while this replacement checks whether they are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two objects have the same number of operations, while this replacement checks whether they have different lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length < other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two objects have the same number of operations, while this replacement checks whether the length of the first object is less than the length of the second object.

DONE.
