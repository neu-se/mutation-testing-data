  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uffff/
```
This would result in different behavior because `\uffff` is a different Unicode code point than `\uFEFF`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\ufeff/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/u` flag is absent in the replacement, so the regex engine would not treat the pattern as a Unicode pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^foo/
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is a different string than `\uFEFF`.

DONE.
