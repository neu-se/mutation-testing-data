  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.last
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.last` returns the last element in the iteration, whereas `iter.peek` returns the next element without advancing the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` advances the iteration by one element, whereas `iter.peek` returns the next element without advancing the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(2)` returns the next two elements without advancing the iteration, whereas `iter.peek()` returns the next element without advancing the iteration.

DONE.
