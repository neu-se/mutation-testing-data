  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject(error)` would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the original code fragment `end` would resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.reject(error))
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve(Q.reject(error))` would resolve the promise with a rejected promise, whereas the original code fragment `end` would resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.resolve(error))
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve(Q.resolve(error))` would resolve the promise with a resolved promise, whereas the original code fragment `end` would resolve the promise with the given value.

DONE.
