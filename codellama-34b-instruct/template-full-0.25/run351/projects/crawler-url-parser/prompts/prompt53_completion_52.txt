  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because only the base URL is passed as an argument, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the hostname is passed as an argument, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
