  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the `targetFilePath` to be used as the output stream even if a custom write stream is provided in the options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the `targetFilePath` to be used as the output stream even if a custom write stream is not provided in the options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the `targetFilePath` to be used as the output stream only if a custom write stream is provided in the options.
