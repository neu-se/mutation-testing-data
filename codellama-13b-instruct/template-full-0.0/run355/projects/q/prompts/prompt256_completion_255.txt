  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `Q` function, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called on the `Q` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `resolve` method, rather than the original value.

DONE.
