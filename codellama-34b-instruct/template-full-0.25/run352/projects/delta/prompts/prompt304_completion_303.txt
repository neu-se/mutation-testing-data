  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `i < 0` would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once, as the condition `i < 0` would be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute twice, as the condition `i < 0` would be true for both iterations.

DONE.
