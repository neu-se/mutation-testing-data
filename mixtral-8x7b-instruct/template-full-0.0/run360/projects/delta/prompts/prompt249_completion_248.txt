 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.min()` function to always return the first operand, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `diff()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.min()` function to always return the second or third operand, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `diff()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.min()` function to potentially return a value that is twice the length of the current operation, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `diff()` method.

DONE.
