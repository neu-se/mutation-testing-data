  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the arguments passed to a function, while the given code fragment simply returns an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { return arguments }())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object inside the function, while the given code fragment is using the `arguments` object outside the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object inside the function, while the given code fragment is using the `arguments` object on the `this` context.

DONE.
