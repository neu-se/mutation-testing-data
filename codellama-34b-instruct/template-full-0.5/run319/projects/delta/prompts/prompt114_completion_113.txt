  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the index of the next op instead of the current op to the predicate function, which could cause the predicate to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the index of the previous op instead of the current op to the predicate function, which could cause the predicate to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the index of the op after the current op to the predicate function, which could cause the predicate to behave differently.

DONE.
