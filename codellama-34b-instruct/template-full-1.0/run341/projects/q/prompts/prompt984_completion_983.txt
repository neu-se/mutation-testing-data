  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because .fail() would not be called if the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because .notify() would be called, which can be used to notify progress, instead of .fail() which is used to notify errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because .makeNodeResolver() creates a resolver function that can be used to resolve the promise, instead of .reject() which will reject the promise.

DONE.
