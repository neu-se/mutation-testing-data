  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, but `flush` is a function that takes one argument. Calling `requestTick` with `flush` as an argument would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as an argument, but `function() {}` is not a function that does anything useful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as an argument, and this function would throw an error when called.

DONE.
