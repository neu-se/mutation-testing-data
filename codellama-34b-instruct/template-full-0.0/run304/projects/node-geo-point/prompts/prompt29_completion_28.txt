  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is increased by 1, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is multiplied by 2, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
