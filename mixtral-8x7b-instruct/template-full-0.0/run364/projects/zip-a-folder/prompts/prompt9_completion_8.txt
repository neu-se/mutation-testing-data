 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is an empty string instead of checking if it's a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof src !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is not a string, instead of checking if it's a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is not an array, instead of checking if it's a glob. This is less likely to occur in a real-world scenario, as `src` is expected to be a string, but it's still a valid mutation that could potentially expose weaknesses in the test suite.

DONE.
