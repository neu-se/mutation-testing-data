  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called with an empty array as the second argument, which would clear the queue instead of adding a new item to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called with the `cbs` variable as the second argument, which is a list of callbacks. This would cause the queue to be overwritten with the `cbs` list instead of adding a new item to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called with `null` as the second argument, which would clear the queue instead of adding a new item to it.

DONE.
