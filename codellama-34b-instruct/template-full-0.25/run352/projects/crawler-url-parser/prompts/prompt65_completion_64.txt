  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.replace(/^www\./, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would modify the `host` property, potentially changing the domain name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split('.').reverse()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` and `reverse` methods would extract the top-level domain (TLD) from the `host` property, potentially changing the domain name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.match(/^([^.]+)\./)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would extract the first subdomain from the `host` property, potentially changing the domain name.

DONE.
