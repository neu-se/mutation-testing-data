  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would cause the `dispatch` method to return a rejected promise, whereas `Q` would return a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when(Q.reject())` would return a promise that is resolved with the value of `Q.reject()`, whereas `Q` would return a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(Q.reject(), function() { return Q.resolve(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when(Q.reject(), function() { return Q.resolve(); })` would return a promise that is resolved with the value of `Q.resolve()`, whereas `Q` would return a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
