  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array, while the new code fragment returns an array with a single element, which is the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array, while the new code fragment returns an array with three elements, which are the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array, while the new code fragment returns an array with five elements, which are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

DONE.
