  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would change the case of the base URL, which could potentially affect the parsing logic in the `parse()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, and could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would change the order of the characters in the base URL, which could potentially affect the parsing logic.

DONE.
