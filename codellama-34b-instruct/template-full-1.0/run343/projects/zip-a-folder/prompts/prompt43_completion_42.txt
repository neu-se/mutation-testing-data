  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the glob pattern to be truncated, potentially leading to files being included or excluded from the archive that should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '**')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all `*` characters in the glob pattern with `**`, potentially leading to files being included or excluded from the archive that should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.indexOf('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first `/` character in the glob pattern, potentially leading to files being included or excluded from the archive based on the position of the `/` character.

DONE.
