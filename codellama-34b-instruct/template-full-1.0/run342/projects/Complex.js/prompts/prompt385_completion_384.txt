  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is a function that returns the tangent of a number, but the original code uses `Math.cos` which returns the cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is a function that returns the hyperbolic sine of a number, but the original code uses `Math.cos` which returns the cosine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is a function that returns the arccosine of a number, but the original code uses `Math.cos` which returns the cosine of a number.

DONE.
