 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { cb(true) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb` directly, while the mutated code wraps `cb` in an anonymous function. This could affect the behavior of the `abortCb` function if it relies on the calling context of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(null, [true])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb` with a single argument, while the mutated code uses the `apply` method to call `cb` with the same argument but in a different context. This could affect the behavior of the `abortCb` function if it relies on the calling context of the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb` with a single argument (`true`), while the mutated code
