  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the code to behave in unexpected ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it could cause the code to behave in unexpected ways.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the code to behave in unexpected ways.

DONE.
