  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs of the map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys of the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of this._data.keys()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys of the map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const val of this._data.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator over the values of the map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of the map.

DONE.
