Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the length of the `attributes` property instead of the actual length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect calculations of how much of the operation can be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the length, causing the `next` method to treat every operation as having no length, which would lead to incorrect handling of operations and potentially skipping them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity - this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length based on the remaining offset, which could lead to incorrect behavior when trying to process operations, as it would not reflect the actual length of the operation being processed.

DONE.
