  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator, while this replacement uses the logical OR operator. This would cause the function to return a different value when the absolute value of the argument is greater than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator, while this replacement uses the equality operator. This would cause the function to return a different value when the absolute value of the argument is equal to 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator, while this replacement uses the inequality operator. This would cause the function to return a different value when the absolute value of the argument is not equal to 3000.

DONE.
