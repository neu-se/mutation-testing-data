  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for the `base` element, while the new code fragment is looking for the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for the `base` element, while the new code fragment is looking for an element with the ID `base`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for the `base` element, while the new code fragment is looking for an element with the class `base`.

DONE.
