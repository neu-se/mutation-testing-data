  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 1, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `dispatch` method would be `1` instead of `undefined`, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, void 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `dispatch` method would be `1` instead of `undefined`, and the order of the arguments would be reversed, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
