  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, while this new fragment checks if it's `false`. If `abort` is `false`, the original code would return `null`, while this new fragment would return `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === undefined ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, while this new fragment checks if it's `undefined`. If `abort` is `undefined`, the original code would return `null`, while this new fragment would return `abort`.
