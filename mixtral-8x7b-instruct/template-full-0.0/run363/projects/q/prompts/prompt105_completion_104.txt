 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the number 0 as the second argument of the callback, instead of the current array element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes the current object (`this`) as the second argument of the callback, instead of the current array element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index * index
