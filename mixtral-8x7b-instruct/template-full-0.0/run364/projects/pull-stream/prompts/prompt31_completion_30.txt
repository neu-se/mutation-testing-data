 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[1], ref[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially causing unexpected results if the function being called relies on the order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(0, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the first three elements of `ref`, instead of passing the original `ref` array. This could cause issues if the `pull` function modifies the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[ref[0], read, ref[1]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially causing unexpected results if the function being called relies on the order of arguments.

DONE.
