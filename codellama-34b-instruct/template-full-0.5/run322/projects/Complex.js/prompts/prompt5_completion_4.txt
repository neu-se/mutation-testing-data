  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` and `Math.cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `Math.sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, which is related to the hyperbolic cosine function `Math.cosh` by the identity `sinh(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x))/2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which is related to the hyperbolic cosine function `Math.cosh` by the identity `tanh(x) = sinh(x)/cosh(x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atanh` is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function,
