  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is an object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is a function. This could cause the code to behave differently if `
