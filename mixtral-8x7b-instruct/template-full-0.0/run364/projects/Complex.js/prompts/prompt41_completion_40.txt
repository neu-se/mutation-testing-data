 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential value of a number, not the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log1p
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log1p` calculates the natural logarithm of (1 + number), not just the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` calculates the base 10 logarithm of a number, not the natural logarithm.

DONE.
