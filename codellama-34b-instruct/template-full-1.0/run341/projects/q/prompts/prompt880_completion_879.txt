  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.resolve is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.makeNodeResolver() is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
