  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if `linkurl_path` starts with `pageurl_path`, while `includes` checks if `linkurl_path` contains `pageurl_path` as a substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks if `pageurl_path` is a substring of `linkurl_path`, and checks if it is at index 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring(0, pageurl_path.length) === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` checks if the first `pageurl_path.length` characters of `linkurl_path` are equal to `pageurl_path`.

DONE.
