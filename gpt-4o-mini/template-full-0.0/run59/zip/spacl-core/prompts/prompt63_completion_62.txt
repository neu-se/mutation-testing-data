Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props: props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the properties in the `props` array, potentially affecting any logic that relies on the order of these properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props: props.map(p => p.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform all property names to uppercase, which may not match the expected case-sensitive property names used elsewhere in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props: props.concat(['newProp'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional property `'newProp'` to the `props` array, which could lead to unexpected results if the rest of the code assumes a specific set of properties.

DONE.
