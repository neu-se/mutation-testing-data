  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and output values, and the surrounding code is sensitive to these differences. Specifically, the `cosh` function uses `Math.exp` to compute the exponential function, which is then divided by 2 to compute the hyperbolic cosine. If `Math.sin` were used instead, the result would be the sine function, which has a different range and output values than the hyperbolic cosine. This would cause the `cosh` function to produce incorrect results, leading to different behavior in the surrounding code. DONE.
