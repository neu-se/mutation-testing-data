  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `this.rules` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array containing only the elements that match the provided predicate, whereas `this.rules` returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array containing the results of applying the provided function to each element, whereas `this.rules` returns the original array.

DONE.
