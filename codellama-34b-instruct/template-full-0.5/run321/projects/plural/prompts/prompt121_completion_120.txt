  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not add the 's' suffix to words ending in 'ics', while this modified code fragment would add the 's' suffix to all words ending in 'ics', regardless of whether they are countable or uncountable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add the 's' suffix to words ending in 'ics', while this modified code fragment would add the 'ices' suffix to all words ending in 'ics', regardless of whether they are countable or uncountable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'i' }
