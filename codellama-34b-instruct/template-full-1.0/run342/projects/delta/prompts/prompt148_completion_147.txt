  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `index` is a variable that is used to track the current position in the delta, while the new code always sets `index` to 0, causing the code to always use the same position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = Math.min(this.ops.length - 1, other.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `index` is a variable that is used to track the current position in the delta, while the new code always uses the minimum value of `this.ops.length - 1` and `other.ops.length - 1`, causing the code to always use the same position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = Math.max(this.ops.length - 1, other.ops.length - 1);
```
This would
