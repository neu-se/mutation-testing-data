  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest` would not be a valid property of the `otherIter` object, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` does not have a `slice` method, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` does not have a `slice` method, causing an error.

DONE.
