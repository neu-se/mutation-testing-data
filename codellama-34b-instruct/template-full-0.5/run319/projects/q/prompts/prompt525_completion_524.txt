  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used in the `dispatch` function, which is used to determine the type of object being passed to the `inspect` function. By adding 1 to `op`, the type of object being passed would be different, which could cause the `inspect` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used in the `dispatch` function, which is used to determine the type of object being passed to the `inspect` function. By multiplying `op` by 2, the type of object being passed would be different, which could cause the `inspect` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used in the `dispatch` function, which
