  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER in the code fragment can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a different function than `Math.pow`, and it would cause the code to return the absolute value of the base instead of the base raised to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER in the code fragment can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a different function than `Math.pow`, and it would cause the code to return the square root of the base instead of the base raised to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER in the code fragment can be replaced with:
```
Math. round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` is a different function than `Math.pow`, and it would cause the code to return the rounded value of the base instead of the base raised to a power.

DONE.
