  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `isInfinite` method, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the complex number is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the number is finite, not infinite, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the number is not a number (NaN), and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
