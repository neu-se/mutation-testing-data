  Sure, here are three answers as requested:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).delay(timeout + 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be increased by 1000 milliseconds, which could cause the promised value to be rejected due to the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).delay(timeout - 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be decreased by 1000 milliseconds, which could cause the promised value to be fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).delay(timeout + Q.delay(1000));
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be increased by 1000 milliseconds, but only after the promise has been resolved. This could cause the promised value to be rejected due to the timeout.

DONE.
