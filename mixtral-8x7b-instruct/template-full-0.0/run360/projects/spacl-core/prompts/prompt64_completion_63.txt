 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.length = this.rules.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of pushing the new rules to the `rules` array, it sets the length of the array to itself plus one, which will not add any elements to the array but will increase the length, potentially causing out-of-bounds errors or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules = this.rules.concat(rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method to combine the existing `rules` array with the new `rules` array, instead of using the `push` method to add the new rules to the existing array. This will result in a new array being created, rather than modifying the existing array, which could cause issues if other parts of the codebase are expecting the original array to be modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.shift()
```
