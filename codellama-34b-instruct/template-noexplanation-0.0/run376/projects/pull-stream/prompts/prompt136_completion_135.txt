  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a `null` value, which is different from the original code fragment where `err` is passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with an `undefined` value, which is different from the original code fragment where `err` is passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a new `Error` object, which is different from the original code fragment where `err` is passed as an argument.

DONE.
