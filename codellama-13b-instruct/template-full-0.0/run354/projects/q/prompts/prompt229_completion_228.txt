  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being accessed directly, rather than being passed as a whole to the `promiseDispatch` method. This could cause issues if the `args` array is not the expected format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being copied and passed as a whole to the `promiseDispatch` method. This could cause issues if the `args` array is not the expected format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function (arg) { return arg; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being mapped to a new array, which could cause issues if the `args` array is not the expected format.

DONE.
