  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would not be called, and the `ret` object would not be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with `null` as the second argument, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which would cause an error.

DONE.
