  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` instead of `true` for the second occurrence of an item, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to pass the item through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `null` instead of `true` for the second occurrence of an item, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to pass the item through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `undefined` instead of `true` for the second occurrence of an item, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to pass the item through.

DONE.
