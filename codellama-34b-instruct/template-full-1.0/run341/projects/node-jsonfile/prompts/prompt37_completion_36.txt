  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, str, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the file path is replaced with null, which would cause the function to throw an error when it attempts to access the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, 'undefined', options
```
This would result in different behavior because the string value is replaced with 'undefined', which is not a valid file path and would cause the function to throw an error when it attempts to access the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str.toLowerCase(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because the string value is converted to lowercase, which would cause the function to read a different file than the one specified in the original code fragment.

DONE.
