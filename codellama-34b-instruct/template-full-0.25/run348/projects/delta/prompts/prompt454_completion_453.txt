  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the code would not execute the same way if the offset is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, which means that the code would not execute the same way if the offset is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks for less than, which means that the code would not execute the same way if the offset is less than zero.

DONE.
