  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return Q.resolve(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with its original value, rather than the value returned by the `when` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return Q.reject(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with its original value, rather than the value returned by the `when` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return Q.resolve(value + 1);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the original value plus one, rather than the value returned by the `when` callback.

DONE.
