  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is a function call, and replacing it with `defer` (a function) would result in a different type of value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function call, and replacing it with `defer` would result in a different type of value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => defer` is a function that returns `defer`, and replacing it with `defer` would result in a different type of value.

DONE.
