  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which means that the `reverse` method was called with an argument that was determined by the value of the `PLACEHOLDER` variable. However, by replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` with `.reverse()`, the `reverse` method is called without any arguments, which means that the array will be reversed in place, rather than creating a new array with the elements in reverse order.

DONE.
