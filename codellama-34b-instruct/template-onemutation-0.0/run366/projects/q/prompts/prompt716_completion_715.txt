  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "keys" method on the promise instead of the "dispatch" method, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an array of the keys of the object instead of the object itself.

DONE.
