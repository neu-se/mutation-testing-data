  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice()` would be different, potentially resulting in a different array of arguments being passed to the `dispatch()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be passed directly to the `dispatch()` method, potentially resulting in a different set of arguments being passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` method would only take the first two arguments from the `arguments` object, potentially resulting in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch()` method.

DONE.
