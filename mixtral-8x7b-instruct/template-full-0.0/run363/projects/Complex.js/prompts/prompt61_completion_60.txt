 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the input, instead of checking if the input is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the absolute value of the input's phase angle is finite, instead of checking if the input itself is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Infinity, regardless of the input, instead of checking if the input is finite.

DONE.
