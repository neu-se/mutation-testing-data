Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic from replacing the last part of the path with an empty string to simply retrieving the last part of the path, which does not modify the `linkurl_path` at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/newpart");
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with a fixed string `"/newpart"` instead of removing it, which alters the intended comparison logic in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, ""); // using a different variable
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the same logic but could potentially refer to a different variable if `linkurl_path` was mistakenly reassigned earlier in the code, leading to unexpected results in the comparison.

DONE.
