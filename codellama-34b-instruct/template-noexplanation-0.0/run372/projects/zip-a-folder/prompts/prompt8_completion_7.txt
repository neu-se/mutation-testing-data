  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This change will cause the code to throw an error if the source and target folders are the same, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === src + '1'
```
This change will cause the code to throw an error if the source and target folders are the same, but with an additional character at the end of the target folder path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This change will cause the code to throw an error if the source folder is a substring of the target folder path, which is a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
