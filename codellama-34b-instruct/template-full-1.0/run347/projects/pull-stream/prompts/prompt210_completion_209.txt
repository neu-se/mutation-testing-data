  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` function is not defined in the code, and it would result in a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is not defined in the code, and it would result in a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and it would result in a type error.

DONE.
