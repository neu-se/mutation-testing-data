Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Value is null'))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning `true`, it will invoke the callback with an error indicating that the value is null, which changes the expected output and error handling of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'default value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return a default string value instead of `true`, which alters the expected output of the callback and may lead to incorrect assumptions in the consuming code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `undefined` instead of `true`, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that relies on the callback returning a truthy value.

DONE.
