  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with the error as the first argument and the value as the second argument, while this modified code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with the error as the first argument and `null` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with the error as the first argument and the value as the second argument, while this modified code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with `null` as the first argument and the error as the second argument.
