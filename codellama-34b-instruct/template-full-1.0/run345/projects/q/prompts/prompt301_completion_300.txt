  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, that]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` object is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the same object is being passed as both arguments.

DONE.
