  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());`, which passes no arguments to `makeNodeResolver`, while the new code fragment passes `null` as an argument. This could potentially cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to behave differently, leading to different behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());`, which passes no arguments to `makeNodeResolver`, while the new code fragment passes an empty function as an argument. This could potentially cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to behave differently, leading to different behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.
