  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` for non-zero imaginary parts, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` for zero imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` for positive imaginary parts, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` for zero imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` for negative imaginary parts, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` for zero imaginary parts.

DONE.
