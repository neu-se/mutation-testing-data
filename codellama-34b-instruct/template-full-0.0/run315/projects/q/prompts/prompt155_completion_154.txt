  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").reverse().join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be reversed, which could make it more difficult to understand the order of events leading up to the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.replace(/\n/g, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be condensed into a single line, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").slice(1).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the first line of the stack trace would be removed, which could make it more difficult to understand the context of the error.

DONE.
