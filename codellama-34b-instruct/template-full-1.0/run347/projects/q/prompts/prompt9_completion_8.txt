  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant value is being used instead of a reference to a variable or function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` operator is used to return `undefined` instead of a constant value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` represents a value that is not a number, while the original code fragment is expected to be a boolean value.

DONE.
