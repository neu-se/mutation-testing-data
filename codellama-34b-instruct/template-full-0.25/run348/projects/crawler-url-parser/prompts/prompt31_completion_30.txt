  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would make it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would make it case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would make it match across multiple lines, so it would match even if the URL is split across multiple lines.

DONE.
