  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || -b > x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is greater than `b` or if `-b` is greater than `x`, while the new code fragment checks if `x` is greater than `b` or if `x` is less than `-b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is greater than `b` or if `-b` is greater than `x`, while the new code fragment checks if `x` is greater than `b` or if `x` is less than `-b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || x < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `x` is greater than `b` or if `-b` is greater than `x`, while the new code fragment checks
