  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `close` event instead of the `read_close` event, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that is using the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `end` event instead of the `read_close` event, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that is using the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `error` event instead of the `read_close` event, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that is using the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
