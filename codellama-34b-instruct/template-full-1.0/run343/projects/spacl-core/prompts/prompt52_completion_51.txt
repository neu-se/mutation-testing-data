  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, it would cause the resulting regex to be incorrect, as the input string would not be correctly parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1).push
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` selects all elements of an array except for the first one, so the `push` method would be applied to a different array. In this case, it would cause the resulting regex to be incorrect, as the input string would not be correctly parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.filter(Boolean).push
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter(Boolean)` selects only the elements of an array that evaluate to true when converted to a boolean value, so the `push` method would be applied to a different array. In this case
