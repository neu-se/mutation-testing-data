  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument, while the modified code fragment `cb(false)` calls the callback function with `false` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument and the value of `array[i++]` as the second argument, while the modified code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument and the value of `array[i++]` as the second argument, but also increments the value of `i` before calling the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
