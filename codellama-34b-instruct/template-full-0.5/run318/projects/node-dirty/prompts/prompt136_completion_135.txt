  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `val` property to always be `undefined`, even if the key is present in the `_data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) || null}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `val` property to be `null` if the key is not present in the `_data` object, instead of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) || this._data.get(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `val` property to be the same as the `key` property, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
