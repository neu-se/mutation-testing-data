  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.concat(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the properties of `b` to the properties of `a`, which would result in a different set of attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.filter(key => key in b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include properties that are in both `a` and `b`, which would result in a different set of attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.map(key => key in b ? key : undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map the properties of `a` to the properties of `b`, which would result in a different set of attributes.

DONE.
