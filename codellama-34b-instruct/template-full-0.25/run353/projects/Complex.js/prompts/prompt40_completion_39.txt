  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the replaced code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the replaced code fragment uses the inverse of the distributive property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * (a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the replaced code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition with an additional term.

DONE.
