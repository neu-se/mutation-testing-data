  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] === attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `base[key]` is not equal to `attr[key]`, but the replacement code checks whether they are equal. This would cause the `memo[key] = base[key]` assignment to be skipped in cases where `base[key]` is not equal to `attr[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] || attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `base[key]` is not equal to `attr[key]` and `attr[key]` is not equal to `undefined`, but the replacement code checks whether `base[key]` is not equal to `attr[key]` or `attr[key]` is equal to `undefined`. This would cause the `memo[key] = base[key]` assignment to be included in cases where `attr[key]` is `undefined`.
