  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isInteger
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of what the original code fragment would return, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `Number.isInteger` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This code fragment will always return `true` if the input is not a number, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `Number.isInteger` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite
```
This code fragment will always return `true` if the input is a finite number, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `Number.isInteger` function.

DONE.
