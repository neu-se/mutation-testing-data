  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be decreased by 1 instead of increased by 1, which could cause the iterator to go back to the previous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by the length of the current operation instead of 1, which could cause the iterator to skip over multiple operations.

DONE.
