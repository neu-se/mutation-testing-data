  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this replacement only checks for the presence of the string "http".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes('://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this replacement only checks for the presence of the string "://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match(/^(?!localhost)\w+:/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this replacement only checks for the presence of a protocol that is not "localhost".

DONE.
