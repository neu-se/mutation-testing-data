  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` if the `timezone` variable is `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone !== null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` if the `timezone` variable is not `null`, which is also not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.length === 0
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` if the `timezone` variable is an empty string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
