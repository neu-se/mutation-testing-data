  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: null}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` property would always be `null`, regardless of whether the key is present in the database or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` property would be set to the value of the key in the database plus 1, which would cause the logic to fail if the database contains non-zero values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) - 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` property would be set to the value of the key in the database minus 1, which would cause the logic to fail if the database contains non-zero values.

DONE.
