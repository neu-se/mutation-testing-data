  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `cb` with one argument, while this modified code calls it with two arguments. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb` with the `ended` flag as the first argument, while this modified code calls it with `null` as the first argument. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle a `null` value as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended ? null : data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb` with `data` as the second argument, while this modified code calls it with `null` as the second argument if `ended` is `true`. This could cause issues if the callback function is
