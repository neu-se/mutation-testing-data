  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method expects to receive an array of arguments as input, and replacing the `args` variable with `null` would cause it to receive `null` instead, which could result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method expects to receive an array of arguments as input, and replacing the `args` variable with an empty array would cause it to receive an empty array instead, which could result in unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method expects to receive an array of arguments as input, and replacing the `args` variable with an array containing `undefined` would cause it to receive an array with a single element that is `undefined`, which could result in unintended behavior.

DONE.
