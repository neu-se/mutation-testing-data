  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp` is a variable that holds the result of the previous operation, and adding 1 to it would change the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp` is a variable that holds the result of the previous operation, and multiplying it by 2 would change the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp` is a variable that holds the result of the previous operation, and subtracting 1 from it would change the result of the operation.

DONE.
