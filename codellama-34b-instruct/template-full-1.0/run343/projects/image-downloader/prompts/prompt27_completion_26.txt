  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is an array, and `options[0]` would return the first element of the array, which may not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a string, and the original code fragment is using the `options` object as an argument to the `request` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(path.dirname(options.dest), path.basename(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because this line of code uses the `path.dirname` and `path.basename` functions to manipulate the `options.dest` string, which may not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
