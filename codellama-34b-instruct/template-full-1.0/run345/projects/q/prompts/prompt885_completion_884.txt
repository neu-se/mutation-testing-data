  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the array itself, which could cause the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the callback function instead of the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the callback function instead of the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to fail.

DONE.
