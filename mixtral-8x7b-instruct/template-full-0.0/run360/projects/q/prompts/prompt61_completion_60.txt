 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return flush(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would immediately call `flush` instead of waiting for the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` expects a function reference, not an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` expects a function reference, not a null value.

DONE.
