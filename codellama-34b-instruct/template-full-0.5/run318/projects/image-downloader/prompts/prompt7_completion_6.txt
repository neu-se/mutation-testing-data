  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` extracts the filename from the URL, while the new code fragment `!extractFilename` would negate the result of the `extractFilename` function, potentially leading to a different filename being used in the `dest` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` extracts the filename from the URL, while the new code fragment `extractFilename()` would call the `extractFilename` function without any arguments, potentially leading to a different filename being used in the `dest` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` extracts the filename from the URL, while the new code fragment `path.basename(options.url)`
