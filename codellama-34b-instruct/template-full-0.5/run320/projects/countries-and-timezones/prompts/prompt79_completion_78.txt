  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which may not match the original name used in the `data.json` file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name.split(' ').join('_'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` and `join()` methods would replace spaces in the timezone name with underscores, which may not match the original name used in the `data.json` file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name.replace('UTC', 'GMT'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the string "UTC" with "GMT" in the timezone name, which may not match the original name used in the `data.json` file.

DONE.
