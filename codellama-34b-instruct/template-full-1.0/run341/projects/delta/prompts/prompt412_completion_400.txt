  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip the last op in the delta, potentially leading to an incorrect transformation result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip the last op in the delta, potentially leading to an incorrect transformation result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to include an additional op in the delta, potentially leading to an incorrect transformation result.

DONE.
