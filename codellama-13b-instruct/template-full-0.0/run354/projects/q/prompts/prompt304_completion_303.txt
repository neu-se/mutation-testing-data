  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra iteration, potentially causing the code to access an out-of-bounds index in the `answerPs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, potentially causing the code to not resolve any of the promises in the `answerPs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one less iteration, potentially causing the code to miss some of the promises in the `answerPs` array.

DONE.
