  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 && b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `a * Math.sqrt(1 + b * b)` instead of only returning that value when `a` and `b` are both greater than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 3000 && b !== 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `a * Math.sqrt(1 + b * b)` instead of only returning that value when `a` and `b` are not both equal to 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b !== 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `a * Math.sqrt(1 + b * b)` instead of only returning that value when the sum of
