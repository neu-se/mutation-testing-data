Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 || b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either `a` or `b` is not zero, which would lead to the function returning a value when both `a` and `b` are zero, contrary to the original logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `a` is zero and `b` is positive, which would cause the function to return a value for cases where `b` is negative or both are zero, thus altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the condition to only when both `a` and `b` are equal to 1, which would prevent the function from returning a value when both are zero, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.

DONE.
