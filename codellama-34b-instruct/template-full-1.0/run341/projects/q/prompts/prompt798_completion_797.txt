  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise object, which would cause the `then` method to be called on a different object than the one that was created by the `deferred` object. This could cause the `then` method to be called multiple times or not at all, depending on the implementation of the `Q` promise library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q( undefined )
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`, which is not the same as the promise that was created by the `deferred` object. This could cause the `then` method to be called with a different value than expected, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q( null )
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is resolved with the value `null`, which is not the same as the promise that was created
