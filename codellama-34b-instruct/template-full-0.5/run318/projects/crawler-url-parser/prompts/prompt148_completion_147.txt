  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to use a different delimiter, leading to a different number of elements in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to use a different delimiter, leading to a different number of elements in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to use a different delimiter, leading to a different number of elements in the resulting array.

DONE.
