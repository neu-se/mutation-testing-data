  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason. In the context of the code, using `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the error object, rather than rejected with it, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Custom error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a custom error message, rather than the default error message that is used in the original code. This could cause the code to behave differently, for example, by changing the error message that is displayed to the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a null value, rather than an error
