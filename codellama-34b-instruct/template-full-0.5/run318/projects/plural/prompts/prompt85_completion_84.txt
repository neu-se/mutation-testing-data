  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment added a new rule for the word "mouse" to the pluralization rules, while this replacement would simply return the same word as the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment added a new rule for the word "mouse" to the singularization rules, while this replacement would simply return the word with an additional "s" as the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cat', 'cat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment added a new rule for the word "mouse" to the pluralization rules, while this replacement would simply return the same word as the plural form, without considering the word's actual plural form.

DONE.
