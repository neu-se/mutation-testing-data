  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the logical AND operator. This would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` only when both `this` and `z` are infinite, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if either `this` or `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the logical AND operator. This would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` only when both `this` and `z` are infinite, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if either `this` or `z` is infinite.
