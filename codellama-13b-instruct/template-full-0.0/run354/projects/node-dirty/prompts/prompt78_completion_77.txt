  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event when a corrupted row is encountered during loading, which would cause the program to terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event when a corrupted row is encountered during loading, which would cause the program to terminate.
