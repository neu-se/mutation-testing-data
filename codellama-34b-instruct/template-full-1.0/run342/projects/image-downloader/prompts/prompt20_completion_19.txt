  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `path.isAbsolute` check, potentially allowing the code to call `path.resolve` even when `options.dest` is not absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `options.dest` is absolute, rather than checking if it is a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) !== '.js'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the extension of `options.dest` is not '.js', rather than checking if it is absolute.

DONE.
