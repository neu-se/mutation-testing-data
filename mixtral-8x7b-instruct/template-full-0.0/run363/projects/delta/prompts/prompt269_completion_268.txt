 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new Delta().chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Delta object and calls the `chop` method on it, instead of using the `retDelta` variable that was defined earlier in the function. This would effectively discard any changes made to the `retDelta` object and return an empty Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.chop()
