  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would adjust the latitude instead of the longitude, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would adjust the longitude by adding 1 to it, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would adjust the longitude by multiplying it by 2, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
