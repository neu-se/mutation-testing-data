  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code checks if it's a string. If `otherOp.retain` is a string, the behavior of the code would change, and the mutation testing would not be able to detect the issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code checks if it's an object. If `otherOp.retain` is an object, the behavior of the code would change, and the mutation testing would not be able to detect the issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `other
