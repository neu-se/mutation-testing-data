  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this replacement replaces it with "https://". This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this replacement replaces it with "ftp://". This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this replacement replaces it with "file://". This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results in the `
