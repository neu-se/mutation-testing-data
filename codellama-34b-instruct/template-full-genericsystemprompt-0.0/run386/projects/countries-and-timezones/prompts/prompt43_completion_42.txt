  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object instead of a country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { allTimezones: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object with the `allTimezones` property set to `true`, which is not what the function is intended to do.

DONE.
