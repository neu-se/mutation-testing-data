Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic, causing the callback to be executed with `false` when `ended` is `true`, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the callback would indicate a successful termination without any error, whereas the original code would pass the value of `ended`, which could be `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always signal that the operation has ended successfully, regardless of the actual state of `ended`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the data flow.

DONE.
