  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true if the last op has a retain attribute, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true if the last op has a retain attribute and the length of that attribute is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.some(attr => attr.name === 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true if the last op has a retain attribute and one of the attributes has the name 'foo'.

DONE.
