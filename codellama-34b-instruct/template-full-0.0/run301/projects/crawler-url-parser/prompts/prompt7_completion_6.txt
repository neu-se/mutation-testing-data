  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl
