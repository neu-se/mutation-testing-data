  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the `peekType` method is used to check the type of the next operation in the iterator. If the `peekType` method is not defined, the code will throw an error.

DONE.
