  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function call, whereas `flush, 0` is a comma-separated expression that evaluates to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush.call()` is a function call with an explicit `this` context, whereas `flush, 0` is a comma-separated expression that evaluates to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush.apply()` is a function call with an explicit `this` context and arguments, whereas `flush, 0` is a comma-separated expression that evaluates to `0`.

DONE.
