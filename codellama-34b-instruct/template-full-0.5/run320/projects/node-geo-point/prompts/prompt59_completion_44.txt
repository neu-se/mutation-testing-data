  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the first point would be used instead of the latitude of the second point, which would lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude of the second point would be used instead of the latitude of the second point, which would lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the second point would be increased by 180 degrees, which would lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
