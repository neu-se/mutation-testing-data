  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function returns `true` if the input is a glob pattern, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the `!isGlob(src)` check ensures that the input is not a glob pattern, but if we replace it with `isGlob(src)`, the check will pass for glob patterns, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the input string contains the specified substring. In the original code, the `!isGlob(src)` check ensures that the input does not contain any glob patterns, but if we replace it with `src.includes('*')`, the check will pass for inputs that contain a `*` character, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
