  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx` is a non-null object, and the `.query()` method is called on it with three arguments. If `ctx` is `null`, the method will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx` is a defined object, and the `.query()` method is called on it with three arguments. If `ctx` is `undefined`, the method will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrong_type'
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx` is an object with a `type` property that is set to `'right_type'`, and the `.query()` method is called on it with three arguments. If the `type` property is set to `'wrong_type'`, the method will return `null` instead of the expected result.

DONE.
