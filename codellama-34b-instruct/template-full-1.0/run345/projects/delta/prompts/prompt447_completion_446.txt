  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.op[this.index-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the `op` array instead of the current element, which could cause the program to skip over potentially important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.op[this.index+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element of the `op` array instead of the current element, which could cause the program to perform unnecessary operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.op[this.index*2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current element multiplied by 2, which could cause the program to perform a different number of operations.

DONE.
