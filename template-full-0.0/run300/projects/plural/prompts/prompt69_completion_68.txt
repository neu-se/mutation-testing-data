  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of the word, but in this case, it would return the same word, resulting in the same output for both singular and plural forms.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of the word, but in this case, it would return a different word, resulting in different outputs for both singular and plural forms.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of the word, but in this case, it would return a different function
