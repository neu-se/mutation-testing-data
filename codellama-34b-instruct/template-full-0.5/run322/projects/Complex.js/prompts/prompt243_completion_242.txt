  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `this['im']` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `this['im']` is equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `this['im']` is equal to `NaN`.

DONE.
