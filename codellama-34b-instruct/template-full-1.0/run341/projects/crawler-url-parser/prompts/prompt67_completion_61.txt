  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*"="
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ret.querycount` assignment to always return 0, even if there are query parameters in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
?
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ret.querycount` assignment to always return 1, regardless of the number of query parameters in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!="-"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ret.querycount` assignment to always return 0 if the URL contains query parameters, and 1 otherwise.

DONE.
