  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define.amd && typeof define === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first check if `define.amd` is truthy, and if it is, it would check if `define` is a function. However, this would invert the intended behavior of the code, which is to check if `define` is a function and then check if `define.amd` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define.amd || typeof define !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first check if `define.amd` is truthy, and if it is not, it would check if `define` is not a function. However, this would invert the intended behavior of the code, which is to check if `define` is a function and then check if `define.amd` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it
