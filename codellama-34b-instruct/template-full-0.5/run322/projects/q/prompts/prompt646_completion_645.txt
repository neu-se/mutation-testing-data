  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, whereas the original code uses `this` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code uses `this` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code uses `this` directly.

DONE.
