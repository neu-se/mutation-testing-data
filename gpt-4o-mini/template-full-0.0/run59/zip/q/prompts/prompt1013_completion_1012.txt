Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the resolver to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the end, which may lead to incorrect argument ordering when the callback is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `null` value to the `nodeArgs` array instead of the resolver, which would cause the callback to receive an unexpected `null` argument instead of the expected resolver function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `reject` function instead of the `makeNodeResolver`, which would cause the callback to receive the rejection handler instead of the resolver, leading to incorrect promise resolution behavior.

DONE.
