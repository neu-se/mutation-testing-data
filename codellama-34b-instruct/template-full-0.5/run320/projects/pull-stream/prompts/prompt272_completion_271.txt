  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the original stream, while the original code fragment returns the stream itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new stream that is the result of concatenating the original stream with the provided arguments, while the original code fragment returns the stream itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map()
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new stream that is the result of applying a function to each element of the original stream, while the original code fragment returns the stream itself.

DONE.
