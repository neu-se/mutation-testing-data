  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isZero(Math.abs(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is zero, while this alternative checks whether the absolute value of `b` is zero. This could cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isNaN(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is a number, while this alternative checks whether `b` is not a number (NaN). This could cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is infinite, while this alternative checks whether `b` is not a number (NaN). This could cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

DONE.
