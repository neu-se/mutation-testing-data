  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_keys
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `object_keys` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `object_keys` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `object_keys` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
