  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called with a `null` value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called with an `undefined` value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called with a string value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` exception.

DONE.
