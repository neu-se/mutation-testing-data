  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)` returns the next value after advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next value in the iteration and advances the iterator, whereas `peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)` returns the next value without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek(0)` returns the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)` returns the next value after advancing the iterator.

DONE.
