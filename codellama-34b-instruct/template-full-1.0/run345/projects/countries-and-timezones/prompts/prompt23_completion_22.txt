  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using a shorthand arrow function, while this replacement is using a regular arrow function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `utcOffset` variable, while this replacement is using the `dstOffset` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `utcOffset` variable as-is, while this replacement is adding the `dstOffset` to it before passing it to the `getOffsetStr` function.

DONE.
