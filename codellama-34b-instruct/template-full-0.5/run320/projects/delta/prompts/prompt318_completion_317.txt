  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is `null`, while this replacement checks if it is not `null`. This could cause the `retain` method to be called with a non-null `attributes` argument, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is `null`, while this replacement checks if it is `undefined`. This could cause the `retain` method to be called with an `undefined` `attributes` argument, which could result in different behavior.

```
