  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is falsy, and the Fulfillment branch would be taken, even if the promise is in the "pending" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is an uninitialized primitive, and the Promise initialization process would fail, even if the promise is already resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is a keyword that would exit the executing function, skipping the call to "fulfill" or "resolve", and the promise would not be fulfilled or resolved.

DONE.
