  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException()
```
This would result in different behavior because `newException` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, and thus would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of `Error`, and thus would not be considered a valid exception to be rejected with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an instance of `Error`, and thus would not be considered a valid exception to be rejected with.

DONE.
