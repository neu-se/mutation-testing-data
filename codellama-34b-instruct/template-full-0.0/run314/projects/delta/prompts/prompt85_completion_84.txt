  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` when comparing it with the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object, even if they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to an empty object, which would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` when comparing it with the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object, even if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to an object with a `foo`
