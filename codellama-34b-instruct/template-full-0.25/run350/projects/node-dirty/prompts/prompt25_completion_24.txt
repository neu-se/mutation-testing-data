  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called immediately, without waiting for the data to be persisted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a null value, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an error object, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the callback.

DONE.
