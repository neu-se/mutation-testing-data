  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      const newline = '%&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newline` variable would have a different value than the original code, which would cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      const newline = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newline` variable would have a different value than the original code, which would cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      const newline = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newline` variable would have a different value than the original code, which would cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently.

DONE.
