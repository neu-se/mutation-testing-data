  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would be called instead of `resolve`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would result in an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would be called with the `reject` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a function value instead of a normal value.

DONE.
