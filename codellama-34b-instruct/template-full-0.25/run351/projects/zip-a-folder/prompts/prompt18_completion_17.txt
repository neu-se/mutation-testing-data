  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) will return a value that is the bitwise AND of the two constants, whereas the bitwise OR operator (`|`) will return a value that is the bitwise OR of the two constants.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) will return a value that is the bitwise XOR of the two constants, whereas the bitwise OR operator (`|`) will return a value that is the bitwise OR of the two constants.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator (`+`) will return a value that is the sum
