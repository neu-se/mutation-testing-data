  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `args` array instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array instead of the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the elements of the `args` array starting from the second element instead of the array itself.

DONE.
