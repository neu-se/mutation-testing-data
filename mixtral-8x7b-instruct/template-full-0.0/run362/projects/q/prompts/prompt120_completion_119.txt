 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would always return `true`, instead of checking if the object has the specified property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` would now check if the object contains the property as an element in an array, instead of checking if the object has the specified property directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` would now return a random boolean value, instead of checking if the object has the specified property.

These changes would cause the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to behave differently, potentially causing test failures and revealing weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
