  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because "this" will refer to the global object rather than the "callback" variable, which may cause unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because "Q.fcall" is a different function than "callback.fcall", and may not behave in the same way when called with the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function will be called instead of "callback.fcall", which may cause unintended behavior.

DONE.
