  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `send` is not the same as `post`, and it would call a different method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first argument from the list of arguments, which could cause unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is not the same as `post`, and it would call a different method.

DONE.
