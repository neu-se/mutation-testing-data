  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, while this replacement uses the `-` operator. This would cause the function to return a different value, and potentially cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, while this replacement uses the `-` operator. This would cause the function to return a different value, and potentially cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, while this replacement uses the `+` operator with a different constant. This would cause the function to return a different value, and potentially cause errors in the surrounding code.

DONE.
