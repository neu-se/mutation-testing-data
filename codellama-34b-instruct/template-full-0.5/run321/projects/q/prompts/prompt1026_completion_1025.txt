  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method would return `null` instead of the expected `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method would return `undefined` instead of the expected `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method would return an empty object instead of the expected `object`.

DONE.
