  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive a `null` argument, which would cause it to throw an error instead of creating a new policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive an `undefined` argument, which would cause it to return a new policy with an empty name and no rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(new Rule())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive a new `Rule` object as an argument, which would cause it to create a new policy with a single rule that is not present in the original policy.

DONE.
