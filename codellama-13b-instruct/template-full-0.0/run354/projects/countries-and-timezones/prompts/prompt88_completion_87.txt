  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would capitalize the timezone name, which could cause the test to fail if the timezone name is expected to be in a specific case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would lowercase the timezone name, which could cause the test to fail if the timezone name is expected to be in a specific case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.substring(0, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return the first three characters of the timezone name, which could cause the test to fail if the timezone name is expected to be in a specific format.

DONE.
