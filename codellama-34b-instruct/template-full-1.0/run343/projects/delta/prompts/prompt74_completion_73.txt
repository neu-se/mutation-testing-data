  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert.rename();
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is a string, and `rename()` is not a valid method for a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert.undefinedProperty = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefinedProperty` is not a valid property for `newOp.insert` and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert.substr(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is a string, and `substr()` will return a substring from the end of the string, which is not the same as `newOp.insert` itself.

DONE.
