  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of the `Op` object, and `attributes` is a property of the `newOp` object. Using `length` instead of `attributes` would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `newOp` object would be pushed onto the `ops` array without being modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(newOp).length` would return the number of keys in the `newOp` object, which may be different from the number of keys in the `attributes` object. If the number of keys is different, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and the `newOp` object would be modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys
