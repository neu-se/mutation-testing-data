  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index < 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `index < 10` would filter out any elements that have an index greater than or equal to 10, even if they match the predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of the predicate would filter out any elements that do not match the predicate, even if they have an index greater than or equal to 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `index % 2 === 0` would filter out any elements that have an odd index, even if they match the predicate.

DONE.
