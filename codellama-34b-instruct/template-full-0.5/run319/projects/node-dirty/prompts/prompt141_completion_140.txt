  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'corrupt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the `'corrupt'` event may have different behavior than the code that handles the `'error'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the `'invalid'` event may have different behavior than the code that handles the `'error'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the `'drain'` event may have different behavior than the code that handles the `'error'` event.

DONE.
