  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is finite, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isInfinite` function, so if the original code fragment would have returned `true`, the modified code fragment would return `false`, and vice versa.

DONE.
