  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.file` is a method that creates a file entry in the archive, whereas `archiver` is a constructor that creates a new archiver instance. Using `archiver.file` would cause the code to create a file entry in the archive, rather than creating a new archiver instance.

DONE.
