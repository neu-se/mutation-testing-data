  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return the same result as the original code fragment, but it will also throw an error if the `part` variable is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This code fragment will return the same result as the original code fragment, but it will also throw an error if the `part` variable is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, part.length - 1)
```
This code fragment will return the same result as the original code fragment, but it will also throw an error if the `part` variable is an empty string.

DONE.
