  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `c`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `c`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `c`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

DONE.
