  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).invert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined on the `getHandler` method, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined on the `getHandler` method, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).compose
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method is not defined on the `getHandler` method, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
