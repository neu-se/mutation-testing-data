  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument, which would be the value of the `array` element at the current index `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument, which would be the value of the `array` element at the previous index `i`.

DONE.
