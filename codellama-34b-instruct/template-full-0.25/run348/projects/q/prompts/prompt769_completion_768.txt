  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise for an array of promises, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` returns the first resolved promise of an array, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of resolved promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` returns a promise for an array of resolved values, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of resolved promises.

DONE.
