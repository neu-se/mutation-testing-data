  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the real part of the complex number is zero, not the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, not the real part.

DONE.
