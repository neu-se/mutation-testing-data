  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
"( f√∂dd.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new string that would not match the expected output.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
" effetivere frock;"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new string that would not match the expected output.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
"( electron.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new string that would not match the expected output.

DONE.
