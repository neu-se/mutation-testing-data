  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res > true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is not a valid comparison operator for boolean values in JavaScript. Using this code would cause an error and the test would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res <= true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator checks if the value of `res` is less than or equal to `true`, which is always true in this case. Therefore, this code would not catch the error in the test case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks if the value of `res` is not exactly the same as `true`, which is the desired behavior in this test case. Using this code would cause the test to fail when the value of `res` is not exactly `true`, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
