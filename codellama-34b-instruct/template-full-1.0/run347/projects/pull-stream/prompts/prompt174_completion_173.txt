  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` is always a number, while `array` could be any object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(item) { return item.length; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.map(...)` returns a new array with the results of calling a function on each element of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat(otherArray)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.concat(...)` returns a new array that is the concatenation of the original array and the `otherArray`.

DONE.
