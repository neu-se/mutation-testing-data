  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('json', 'txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would attempt to read a file with a `.txt` extension instead of a `.json` extension, which could cause the function to fail if the file does not exist or if the file is not in the correct format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.bak'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would attempt to read a file with a `.bak` extension instead of a `.json` extension, which could cause the function to fail if the file does not exist or if the file is not in the correct format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.split('.')[0] + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would attempt to read a file with a `.json` extension instead of a `.txt` extension, which could cause the function
