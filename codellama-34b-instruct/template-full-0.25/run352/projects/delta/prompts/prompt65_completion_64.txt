  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `insert` property, and it would cause the `insert` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `insert` property, and it would cause the `insert` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid value for the `insert` property, and it would cause the `insert` method to throw an error.

DONE.
