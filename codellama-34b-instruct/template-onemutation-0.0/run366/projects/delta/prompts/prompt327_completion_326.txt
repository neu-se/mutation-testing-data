  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the delta's internal state. `insert` inserts a new operation at the specified index, while `push` appends a new operation to the end of the delta.

DONE.
