  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `fapply` method to apply the function with one argument, while the replaced code fragment would apply the function with zero arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `fapply` method to apply the function with one argument, while the replaced code fragment would apply the function with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `fapply` method to apply the function with one argument, while the replaced code fragment would apply the function with no arguments.

DONE.
