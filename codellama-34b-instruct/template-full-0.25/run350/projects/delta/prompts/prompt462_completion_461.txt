  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `rest` array starting from the second element, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire `rest` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `rest` array starting from the first element and ending at the second element, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire `rest` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `rest` array starting from the last element, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire `rest` array.

DONE.
