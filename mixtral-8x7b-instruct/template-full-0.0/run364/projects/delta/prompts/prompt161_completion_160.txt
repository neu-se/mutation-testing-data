 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator, so the `Delta.compose()` method would end up in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing 0 as the argument to `next()` would cause the iterator to return the current element without advancing, effectively skipping the next operation in the other Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing -1 as the argument to `next()` would throw an error, causing the `Delta.compose()` method to terminate prematurely.

DONE.
