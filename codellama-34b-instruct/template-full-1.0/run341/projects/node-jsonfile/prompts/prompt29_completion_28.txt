  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str = somethingElse(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `somethingElse` is a different function from `stringify`, and may produce a different result or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str = stringify(obj, somethingElse)
```
This would result in different behavior because `somethingElse` is a different value from `options`, and may produce a different result or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str = stringify(somethingElse, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `somethingElse` is a different value from `obj`, and may produce a different result or error.

DONE.
