  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is switched, which could cause the callback function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    throw err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'fulfilled' and 'progress' callbacks would not be called, and any error would be thrown instead.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return err.message;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'fulfilled' and 'progress' callbacks would not be called, and the error message would be returned instead.

DONE.
