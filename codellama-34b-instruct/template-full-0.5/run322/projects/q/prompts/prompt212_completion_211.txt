  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any non-null value, even if it's not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any defined value, even if it's not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== "Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value that is not the string "Promise".

DONE.
