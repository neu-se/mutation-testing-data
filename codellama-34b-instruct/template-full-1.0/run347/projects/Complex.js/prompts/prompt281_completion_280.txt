  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) * sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sinh` function with the argument `b`, while this alternative code fragment uses the `sin` function with the argument `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) * sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sinh` function with the argument `b`, while this alternative code fragment uses the `cosh` function with the argument `b` followed by the `sin` function with the argument `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(b) * cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sinh` function with the argument `b`, while this alternative code fragment uses the `tanh` function with the argument `b` followed by the `cos` function with the argument `a`.
