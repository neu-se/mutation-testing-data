  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the sum of plus and minus to be equal to zero, as well as whether the current character is a number. However, the new code fragment only checks if the current character is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || !isFinite(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the sum of plus and minus to be equal to zero, as well as whether the current character is a finite number. However, the new code fragment only checks if the current character is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the sum of plus and minus to be equal to zero, as well as whether the current character is
