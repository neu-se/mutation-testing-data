Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` directly into `retDelta` without checking for equality with `thisOp`, potentially leading to incorrect diffs being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the length of the operation instead of pushing the operation into `retDelta`, which would result in loss of data and incorrect delta representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the operation instead of pushing the `otherOp`, which would not accurately represent the differences between the two deltas.

DONE.
