  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`. By replacing it with `0`, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`. By replacing it with `2`, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`. By replacing it with `-1`, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the function to return a different value.
