  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operation would be replaced with a decrement operation, leading to a different value of `i` in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operation would be replaced with an operation that adds 2 to the current value of `i`, leading to a different value of `i` in the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operation would be replaced with an operation that assigns the value of `i` plus 1 to `i`, leading to a different value of `i` in the loop.

DONE.
