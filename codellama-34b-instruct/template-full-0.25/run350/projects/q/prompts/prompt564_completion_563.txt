  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value or the result of another promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason or the result of another promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason or the result of another promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` is a promise that is resolved with the value `null`, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason or the result of another promise.

DONE.
