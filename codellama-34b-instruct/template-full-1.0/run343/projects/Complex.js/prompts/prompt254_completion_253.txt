  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is the trigonometric tangent function, while `Math.exp` is the exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a < b` is a comparison operator that checks if `a` is less than `b`, while `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c++
```
This would result in different behavior because `c++` is a post-increment operator that increments the value of `c` by 1, while `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential of a value.

DONE.
