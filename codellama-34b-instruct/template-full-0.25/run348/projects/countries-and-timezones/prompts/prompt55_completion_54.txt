  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` instead of the expected `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `true`, even if it was previously set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, even if it was previously set to `true` or `false`.

DONE.
