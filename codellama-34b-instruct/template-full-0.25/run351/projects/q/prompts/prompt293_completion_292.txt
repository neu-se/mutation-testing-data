  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a method of the `deferred` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Testing mutation"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a specific error message, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value passed to `deferred.resolve`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Testing mutation")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with a specific message, whereas the original code would not notify the promise at all.

DONE.
