Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the length of the operation to using the value of the `insert` property, which may not represent the same length and could lead to incorrect length calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the dynamic length calculation with a constant value of zero, which would incorrectly assume that every operation has no length, leading to inaccurate results in length calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the focus from the operation itself to the `retain` property, which may not be defined for all operations, potentially leading to undefined behavior or incorrect length calculations.

DONE.
