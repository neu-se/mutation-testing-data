  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is expecting a `data` object, but the original code fragment was using `!test(data)`, which would invert the result of the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the result of the `test` function twice, resulting in the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && last
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is only being checked if the `test` function returns a truthy value. By adding `last` to the condition, the `test` function would only be called if `last` is truthy, which could result in different behavior if `last` is not truthy.

DONE.
