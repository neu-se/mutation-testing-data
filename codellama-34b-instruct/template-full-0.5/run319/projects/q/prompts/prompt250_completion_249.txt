  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the delimiter used to split the stack trace into lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra newline character at the beginning of the stack trace, which could affect how the trace is parsed and displayed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the newline character, which could affect how the trace is parsed and displayed.

DONE.
