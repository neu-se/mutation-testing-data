  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas `arguments` would still refer to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array with the first two elements removed, whereas `arguments` would still refer to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array with the first three elements removed, whereas `arguments` would still refer to the original array.

DONE.
