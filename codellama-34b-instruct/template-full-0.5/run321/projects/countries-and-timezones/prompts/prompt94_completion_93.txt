  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would modify the `countryId` value, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would modify the `countryId` value, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would modify the `countryId` value, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
