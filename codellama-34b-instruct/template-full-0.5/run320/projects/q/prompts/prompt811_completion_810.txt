  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with the `promise` object as an argument, which is not the intended behavior of the `fin` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `callback` function as a parameter to the `then` method of the `promise` object, which is not the intended behavior of the `fin` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of the expected `promise` object.

DONE.
