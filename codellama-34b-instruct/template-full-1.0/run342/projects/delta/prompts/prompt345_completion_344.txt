  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.decompose()
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert` is a method that returns an inverted version of the object, while `decompose` is a method that returns a decomposed version of the object. Decomposing an object is different from inverting it, and it's likely that the test suites will test for inverted objects, not decomposed objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.typeof()
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert` is a method that returns an inverted version of the object, while `typeof` is a method that returns the type of an object. The type of an object is different from its inverted version, and it's likely that the test suites will test for the inverted version of an object, not its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.empty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert` is a method that
