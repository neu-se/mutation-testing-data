  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, which could affect the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different second argument, which could affect the resulting array of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments).reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method would be in reverse order, which could affect the behavior of the method.

DONE.
