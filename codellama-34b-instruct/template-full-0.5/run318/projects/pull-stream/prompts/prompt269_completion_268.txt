  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `end` variable, causing the `return` statement to be executed even if `end` is not truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the second operand if the first operand is falsy, so `cb(null, data)` would only be called if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the second operand if the first operand is truthy, so `cb(null, data)` would only be called if `end` is falsy.

DONE.
