  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number, while `isFinite` checks if the number is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a different value than `this['im']`, and the equality check would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a different value than `this['re']`, and the equality check would return `false`.

DONE.
