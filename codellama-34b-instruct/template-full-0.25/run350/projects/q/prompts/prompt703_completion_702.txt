  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first one to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments as an array, instead of passing them individually.

DONE.
