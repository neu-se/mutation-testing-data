  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out every other operation, rather than every operation that meets the predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => index < 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out operations with an index less than 5, rather than every operation that meets the predicate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out operations that do not have attributes, rather than every operation that meets the predicate.

DONE.
