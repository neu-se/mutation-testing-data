  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the BOM character in the string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\uFEFF/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would only match the first occurrence of the BOM character in the string, instead of all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match the BOM character regardless of its case, instead of only matching the uppercase version.

DONE.
