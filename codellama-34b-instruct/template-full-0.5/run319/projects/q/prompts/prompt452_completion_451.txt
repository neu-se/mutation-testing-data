  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.message` is the message property of the reason object, whereas `reason.stack` is the stack trace of the reason object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.toString()` would return a string representation of the reason object, whereas `reason.stack` is the stack trace of the reason object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.error` would return the error object associated with the reason object, whereas `reason.stack` is the stack trace of the reason object.

DONE.
