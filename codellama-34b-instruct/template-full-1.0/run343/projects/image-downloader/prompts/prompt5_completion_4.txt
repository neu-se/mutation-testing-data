  DONE.


1. The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
return Promise.resolve(new Error('The options.dest is required'))
```

This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is replaced with `Promise.resolve`, which resolves the promise instead of rejecting it.

2. The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is replaced with `throw`, which throws an error and immediately terminates the execution of the function.

3. The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject({message: 'The options.dest is required'}, options.errorCode)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is replaced with `Promise.reject`, but it also includes an additional `options.errorCode` parameter, which may or may not be handled differently by the calling code.
