  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, as the `promise` object does not have an `isFulfilled` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state() !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise at the time the expression is evaluated, rather than the state of the promise at the time the `promise.inspect` method was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise, which would not match the behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
