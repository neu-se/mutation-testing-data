  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` anchor matches the start of the string, so the regular expression would only match if the `#` character is at the beginning of the string. In contrast, the original regular expression `/#.*$/` matches any `#` character that appears anywhere in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression makes it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression makes it case-insensitive, so it would match any `#` character, regardless of whether it is uppercase or lowercase.

DONE.
