  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument, while this new code fragment calls it with `data` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the callback function with `null` as the second argument, while this new code fragment calls it with `null` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, while this new code fragment calls it with `err` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

DONE.
