  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this modified code fragment checks if it is not an insert. This could cause the algorithm to produce a different output in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this modified code fragment checks if it is a delete. This could cause the algorithm to produce a different output in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this modified code fragment checks if it is a retain. This could cause the algorithm to produce a different output in
