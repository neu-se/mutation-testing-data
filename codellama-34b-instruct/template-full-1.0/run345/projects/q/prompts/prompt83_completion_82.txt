  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enter the `if` statement and attempt to flush the queue, regardless of whether it is already flushing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never enter the `if` statement and skip the flushing process entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error and cause the program to terminate.

DONE.
