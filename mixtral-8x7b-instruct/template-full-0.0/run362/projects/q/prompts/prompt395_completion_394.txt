 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would now catch any exceptions thrown during the resolution of the promise, preventing them from being handled by subsequent promises or error handlers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would change the value of `this` within the `then` method, potentially causing unintended behavior or errors if `this` is used within the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty callback function would prevent the resolution value from being passed through to the next promise in the chain, potentially causing unintended behavior or errors downstream.

DONE.
