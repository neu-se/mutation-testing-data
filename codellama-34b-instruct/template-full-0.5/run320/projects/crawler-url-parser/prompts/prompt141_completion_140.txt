  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to replace the last occurrence of a string, while the new code uses a backslash. This would cause the code to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single quote to replace the last occurrence of a string, while the new code uses a backslash. This would cause the code to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to replace the last occurrence of a string, while the new code uses a backslash. This would cause the code to produce a different result.

DONE.
