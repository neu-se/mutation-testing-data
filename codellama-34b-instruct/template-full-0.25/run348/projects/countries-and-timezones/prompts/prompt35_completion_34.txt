  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor(offset / 60)` to calculate the hours, but this replacement code uses `Math.floor(input / 60)` which would calculate the hours based on the input value instead of the offset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(input)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.abs(offset)` to calculate the absolute value of the offset, but this replacement code uses `Math.abs(input)` which would calculate the absolute value of the input value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `input` as is, but this replacement code multiplies the input value by 2, which would change the resulting offset value.

DONE.
