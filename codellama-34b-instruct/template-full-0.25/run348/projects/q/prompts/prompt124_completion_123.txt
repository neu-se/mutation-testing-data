  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `object_hasOwnProperty`, causing the `for` loop to iterate over all properties of the `object` instead of just the own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `undefined` would cause the `for` loop to skip over any properties that have a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && typeof object[key] !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `undefined` using `typeof` would cause the `for` loop to skip over any properties that have a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
