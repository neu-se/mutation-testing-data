  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, while `size` is a property that returns the number of elements in a map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size()` is a method that returns the number of elements in a map, while `size` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a value that is one greater than the actual number of elements in the map.

DONE.
