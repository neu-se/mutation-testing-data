  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, so if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, `!resolvedPromise` will be falsy, and vice versa. This would cause the `become` function to be called with a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
