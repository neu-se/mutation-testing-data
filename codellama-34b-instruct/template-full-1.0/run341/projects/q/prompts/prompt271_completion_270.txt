  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `progressListeners` array instead of the `resolvedPromise` variable, and the `progressListeners` array is never initialized in the provided code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `then` method of the `promise` object, which is not defined in the provided code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `messages` array instead of the `resolvedPromise` variable, and the `messages` array is never initialized in the provided code fragment.

DONE.
