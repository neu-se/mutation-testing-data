  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance to the next element, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the next element without advancing the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the next element without advancing the iterator, but only if the next element is not the last element in the iteration.

DONE.
