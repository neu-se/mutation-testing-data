  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` and `values` are different object properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument array is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument array is different.

DONE.
