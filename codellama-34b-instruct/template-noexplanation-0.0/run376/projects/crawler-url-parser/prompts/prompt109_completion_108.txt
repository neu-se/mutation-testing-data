  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This change will cause the `urlMap` to contain the base URL as well as the current URL, which may result in different behavior in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.protocol
```
This change will cause the `urlMap` to contain the protocol as well as the current URL, which may result in different behavior in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This change will cause the `urlMap` to contain the host as well as the current URL, which may result in different behavior in the `gettype` function.

DONE.
