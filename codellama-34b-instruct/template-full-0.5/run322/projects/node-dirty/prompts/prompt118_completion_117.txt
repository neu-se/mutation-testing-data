  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_closee'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with a different name, which would not be handled by any of the event listeners in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_closee'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with a different name, which would not be handled by any of the event listeners in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event, which would be handled by the error event listener in the code. However, the error event listener would not be able to handle the error correctly because it would not have access to the necessary information to do so.

DONE.
