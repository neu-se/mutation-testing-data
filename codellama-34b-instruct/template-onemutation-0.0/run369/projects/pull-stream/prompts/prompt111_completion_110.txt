  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the `reducer` function, while `null` is a constant value that is not related to the input data. Using `null` instead of `data` would cause the `reducer` function to receive a different input, which could potentially result in a different output.

DONE.
