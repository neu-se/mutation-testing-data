  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i*sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh()` function is different from the `cosh()` function, and the `i` factor would create a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would flip the sign of the returned value, and the `sin()` function is different from the `cos()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh()` function is different from the `sinh()` function, and the `2` factor would double the returned value.

DONE.
