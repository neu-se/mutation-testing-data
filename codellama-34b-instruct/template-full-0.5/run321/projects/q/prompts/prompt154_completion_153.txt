  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be added twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be added with a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would not be added.

DONE.
