  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not calling the `nextStream` function, but instead was referring to it. By adding the parentheses, we are actually calling the function, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not passing any arguments to the `nextStream` function, but this code fragment is passing `null` as the first argument and a function as the second argument. This could potentially cause the `nextStream` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER
