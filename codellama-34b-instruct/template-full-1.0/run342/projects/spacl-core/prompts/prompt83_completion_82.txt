  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buggy code fragment: path && ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the buggy code fragment would first evaluate `path && ctx` and then pass the result to the `matches` method, rather than passing `path` and `ctx` separately as the original code fragment did.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buggy code fragment: ctx || path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the buggy code fragment would first evaluate `ctx || path` and then pass the result to the `matches` method, rather than passing `path` and `ctx` separately as the original code fragment did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buggy code fragment: path !== ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator has a higher precedence than
