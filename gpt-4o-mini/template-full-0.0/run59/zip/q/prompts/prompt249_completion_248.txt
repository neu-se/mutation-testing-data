Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the stack trace string instead of the index of the first newline character, which would not correctly extract the stack trace for further processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first line of the stack trace as a string instead of the entire stack trace starting from the second line, potentially losing important context about the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the last occurrence of a newline character instead of the first, which would lead to incorrect slicing of the stack trace and potentially include unwanted lines at the beginning of the stack trace.

DONE.
