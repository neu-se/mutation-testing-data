  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fbind` function would bind the `null` object instead of the `object` object, which could cause errors if the bound function is called with a `this` value that is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fbind` function would bind the `undefined` object instead of the `object` object, which could cause errors if the bound function is called with a `this` value that is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fbind` function would bind an empty object instead of the `object` object, which could cause errors if the bound function is called with a `this` value that is not an empty object.

DONE.
