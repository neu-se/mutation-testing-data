  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(this, 1)` is a bound function that returns a slice of the array starting from the second element, while `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of the array starting from the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(this, 0, 1)` is a bound function that returns a slice of the array starting from the first element and ending at the second element, while `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of the array starting from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(this, 1
