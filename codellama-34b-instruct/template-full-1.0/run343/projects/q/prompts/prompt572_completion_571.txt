  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeGenerator` function to be called with `null` as its `this` binding, rather than with `this` being bound to the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeGenerator` function to be called with `undefined` as its `this` binding, rather than with `this` being bound to the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeGenerator` function to be called with `Q` as its `this` binding, rather than with `this` being bound to the original object.

DONE.
