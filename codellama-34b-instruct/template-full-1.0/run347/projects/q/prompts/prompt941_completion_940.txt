  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null reference to the function, which would likely cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an undefined value to the function, which would likely cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a reference to the array_reverse function, which would likely cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
