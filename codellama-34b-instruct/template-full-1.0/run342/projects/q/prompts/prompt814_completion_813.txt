  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `fcall`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a different method than `fcall`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with a different `this` value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
