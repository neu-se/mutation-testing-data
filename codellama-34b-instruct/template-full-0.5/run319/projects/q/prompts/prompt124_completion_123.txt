  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(key, object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which would cause the function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the function, causing it to always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "prototype"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `key !== "prototype"` would cause the function to always return `false` for the `prototype` property, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
