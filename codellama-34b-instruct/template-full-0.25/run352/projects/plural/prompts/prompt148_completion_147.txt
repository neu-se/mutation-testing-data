  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement uses the lowercase version of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement appends an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement removes the first character of the word.

DONE.
