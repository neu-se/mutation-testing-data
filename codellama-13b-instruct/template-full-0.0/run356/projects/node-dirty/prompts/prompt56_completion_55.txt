  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `close()` method on the `Dirty` instance, which closes the file streams and emits the `drain` event. The new code fragment would call the `close()` method on the `Dirty` instance, which would close the file streams and emit the `drain` event, but it would also call the `close()` method on the `Dirty` instance again, which would result in an infinite loop.
