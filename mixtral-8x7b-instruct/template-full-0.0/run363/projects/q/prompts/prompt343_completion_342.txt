 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `_fulfilled` function would be added to 1 before being returned, which is different from the original behavior of simply returning the result of the `_fulfilled` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled || 'default value'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `fulfilled` is falsy (e.g. `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `''`, etc.), the expression would evaluate to the string `'default value'` instead of the original behavior of propagating the falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `valueOf` method on the result of the `_fulfilled` function, which may not have a `valueOf` method or may return a different value than the original behavior.
