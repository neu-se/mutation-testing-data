  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to zero, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when the real part of the complex number is equal to zero, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when the real part of the complex number is not equal to zero, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
