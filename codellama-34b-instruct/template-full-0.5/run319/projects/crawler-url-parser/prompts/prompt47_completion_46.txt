  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current URL instead of the base URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the href property of the parsed base URL instead of the parsed URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
