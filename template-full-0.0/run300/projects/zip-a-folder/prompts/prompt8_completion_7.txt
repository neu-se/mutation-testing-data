  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if the source and target folders are the same, which could lead to unintended consequences such as overwriting the source folder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of `targetBasePath`, and would therefore always throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `targetBasePath` includes the value of `src`, rather than checking for strict equality. This could lead to different behavior in cases where the values are not identical, but one is a substring of the other.

DONE.
