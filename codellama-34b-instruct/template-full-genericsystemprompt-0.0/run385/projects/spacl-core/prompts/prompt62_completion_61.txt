  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.reverse()` is a function call that reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array, while `props.reverse` is a reference to the `reverse` method of the `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `props` array, while `props.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of the `props` array and an empty array, while `props.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array in place.

DONE.
