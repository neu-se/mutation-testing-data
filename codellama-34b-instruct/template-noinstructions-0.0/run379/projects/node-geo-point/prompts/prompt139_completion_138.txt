  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude value twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the latitude value twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the sum of the longitude and latitude values, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
