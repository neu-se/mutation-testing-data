  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() 
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will not perform any computation and will always return 1 at each point of the algorithm's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(i) 
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will not perform any computation and will always return 1 at each point of the algorithm's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(i) 
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will not perform any computation and will always return 1 at each point of the algorithm's execution.DONE.
