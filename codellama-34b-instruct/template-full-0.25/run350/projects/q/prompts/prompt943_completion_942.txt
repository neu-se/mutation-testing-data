  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is a function that returns a new deferred object, whereas `defer` is a variable that refers to a deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that refers to a deferred object, whereas `defer()` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Deferred()` is a constructor function that creates a new deferred object, whereas `defer` and `defer()` are variables and functions that refer to or return existing deferred objects.

DONE.
