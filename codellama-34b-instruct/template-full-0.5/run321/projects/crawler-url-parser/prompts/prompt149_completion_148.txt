  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
return elem.length > 0
}).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would flip the order of the array, which would cause the `includes()` method to check for the wrong substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
return elem.length > 0
}).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the array, which would cause the `includes()` method to check for the wrong substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
return elem.length > 0
}).map(function (elem) {
return elem.toLowerCase()
})
```
