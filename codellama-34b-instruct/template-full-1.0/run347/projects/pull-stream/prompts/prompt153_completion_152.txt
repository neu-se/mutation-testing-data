  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was comparing the value of `abort` to `abort`, which would always be `true`. By replacing it with `false`, the condition would always be `false`, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `abort` was not equal to `null`, which would always be `true`. By replacing it with `null`, the condition would always be `false`, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `abort` was not equal to `null`, which would always be `true`. By replacing it with `undefined`, the condition would always be `true`, causing the `ab
