  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with the error object, while the new code fragment `null` would call the callback function with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with the error object, while the new code fragment `undefined` would call the callback function with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with the error object, while the new code fragment `throw err` would throw an error and not call the callback function at all.

DONE.
