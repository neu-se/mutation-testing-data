  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function calls `dispatch` on the object with the `"post"` method, while in this version, it calls it with the `"get"` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function calls `dispatch` on the object with the `"post"` method, while in this version, it calls it with the `"put"` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function calls `dispatch` on the object with the `"post"` method, while in this version, it calls it with the `"del"` method.

DONE.
