  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method is called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method is called with a function that does nothing, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method is called with a function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error instead of being resolved with the original value.

DONE.
