  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = prop(field) || id
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop(field)` would return a different value than `field`, which could cause the `unique` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = field + 1 || id
```
This would result in different behavior because `field + 1` would return a different value than `field`, which could cause the `unique` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = field * 2 || id
```
This would result in different behavior because `field * 2` would return a different value than `field`, which could cause the `unique` function to behave differently.

DONE.
