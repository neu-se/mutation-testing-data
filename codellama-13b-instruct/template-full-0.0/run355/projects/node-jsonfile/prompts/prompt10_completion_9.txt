  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` function would be called with the `options.reviver` argument, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` function would be called without the `options.reviver` argument, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` function would be called with the `null` argument, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
