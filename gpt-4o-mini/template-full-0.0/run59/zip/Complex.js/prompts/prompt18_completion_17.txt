Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from the absolute value of `y` to the sine of `y`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `hypot` function, especially for large values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * y
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the value of `y`, which would affect the calculation of the hypotenuse, potentially leading to incorrect results when `y` is positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the absolute value of `y` with the square root of `y`, which is not equivalent and could lead to incorrect results, especially if `y` is less than 1.

DONE.
