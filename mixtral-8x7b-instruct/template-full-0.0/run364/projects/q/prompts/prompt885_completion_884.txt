 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `nodeArgs` variable to an empty array, which would not contain the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `nodeArgs` variable to `null`, which would not be an array and would not contain the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `nodeArgs` variable to the value of `this`, which may not be an array and may not contain the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function.

DONE.
