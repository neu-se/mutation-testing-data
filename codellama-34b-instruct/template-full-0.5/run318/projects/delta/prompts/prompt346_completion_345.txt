  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `opData`, which is a number, and adding 1 to it would change its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `opData`, which is a number, and multiplying it by 2 would change its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `opData`, which is a number, and subtracting 1 from it would change its value.

DONE.
