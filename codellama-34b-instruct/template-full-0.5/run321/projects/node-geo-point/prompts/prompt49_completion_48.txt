  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value from point1 instead of point2, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
