  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onwarn
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onwarn` is a different function than `Q.onerror` and it would not handle the error in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.oninfo
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.oninfo` is a different function than `Q.onerror` and it would not handle the error in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onwarn if Q.isPromise(exception) else Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `Q.isPromise(exception)` would evaluate to `false` in most cases, and the `else` clause would be executed, which would result in the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
