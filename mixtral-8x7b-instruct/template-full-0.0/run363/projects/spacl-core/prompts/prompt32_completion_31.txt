 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc + seg, '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of concatenation is reversed, which may not produce the expected output or behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc.concat(seg), '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is used instead of the `+` operator, which may behave differently when dealing with certain data types, such as arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => { acc = acc || ''; return acc + seg; }, '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable is initialized as `undefined` and then reassigned, which may cause issues if the rest of the code assumes `acc` to be a string.

DONE.
