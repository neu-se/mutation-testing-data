 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the value to the callback, while this change would always pass null as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any error as the first argument to the callback, while this change would always pass a string 'Error' as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `abortCb` function with the `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` as arguments, while this change would directly call the `onAbort` function.

DONE.
