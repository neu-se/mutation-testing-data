  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `inspect` property of `this`, rather than the `inspect` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a bound version of the `inspect` method, rather than the method itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method immediately, rather than returning it.

DONE.
