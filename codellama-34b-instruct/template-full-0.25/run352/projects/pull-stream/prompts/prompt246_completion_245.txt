  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls `cb` with two arguments, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the function being tested is not expecting two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(true, data)` calls `cb` with two arguments, where the first argument is `true`, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the function being tested is not expecting a truthy value as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with any arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(false
