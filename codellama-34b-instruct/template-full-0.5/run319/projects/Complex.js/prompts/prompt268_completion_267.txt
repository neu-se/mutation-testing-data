  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could cause errors in the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the absolute value of the complex number instead of the real part, which could cause errors in the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['arg']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the argument of the complex number instead of the real part, which could cause errors in the calculation of the complex square root.

DONE.
