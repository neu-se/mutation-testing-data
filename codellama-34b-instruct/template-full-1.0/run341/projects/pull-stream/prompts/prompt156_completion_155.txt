  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `value != null` checks whether `value` is not `null`, while `value === null` checks whether `value` is equal to `null`. If `value` is `null`, then the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`, but the buggy code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `value != null` checks whether `value` is not `null`, while `value !== null` checks whether `value` is not equal to `null`. If `value` is `null`, then the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, but the buggy code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
