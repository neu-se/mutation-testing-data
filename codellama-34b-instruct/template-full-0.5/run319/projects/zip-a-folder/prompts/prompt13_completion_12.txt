  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the glob parts, potentially causing the archive to be created with a different structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {
        cwd: path.dirname(targetFilePath),
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the working directory of the glob search, potentially causing the archive to be created with a different structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {
        ignore: ['**/node_modules/**'],
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude any files or directories that
