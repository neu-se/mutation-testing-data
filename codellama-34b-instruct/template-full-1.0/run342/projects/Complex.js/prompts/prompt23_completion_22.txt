  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a < b) || isNaN(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `a` is `NaN`, the original code would return `false`, while the modified code would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a < b) && !isNaN(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `a` is `NaN`, the original code would return `false`, while the modified code would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a < b) || (isNaN(a) && !isNaN(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because if `a` is `NaN` and `b` is not `NaN`, the original code would return `false`, while the modified code would return `true`.

DONE.
