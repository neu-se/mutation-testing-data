Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `file.sourceMap` exists, potentially causing errors when trying to access `file.sourceMap` later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file && file.sourceMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `line` is truthy, potentially causing incorrect line numbers to be used when resolving the original position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file &&!file.sourceMap && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `file.sourceMap` is falsy instead of truthy, potentially causing the original position to be resolved incorrectly or not at all.

DONE.
