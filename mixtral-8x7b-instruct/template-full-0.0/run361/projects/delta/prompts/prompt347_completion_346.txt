 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert function expects a second argument that is not null, and this change would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert function expects a second argument that is an object with specific properties, and this change would not provide the expected object, potentially causing incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(baseOp.insert as any)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assume that the `baseOp.insert` property is of type `any`, potentially causing incorrect behavior or runtime errors if the property is not of the expected type.

DONE.
