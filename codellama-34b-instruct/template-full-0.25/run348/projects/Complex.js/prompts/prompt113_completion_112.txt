  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this instanceof Complex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `this` is an instance of `Complex`, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a new instance of `Complex` instead of the current instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `this` is not an instance of `Complex`, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a new instance of `Complex` instead of the current instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor === Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `this.constructor` is `Complex`, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a new instance of `Complex` instead of the current instance.

DONE.
