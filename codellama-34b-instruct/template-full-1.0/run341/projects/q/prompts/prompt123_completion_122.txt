  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c++
for (var key in object) key += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the object being iterated over, which could cause errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c++
for (var key in object) key = "key";
```
This would result in different behavior because it reassigns the key variable to a constant value, which would cause the loop to exit after the first iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c++
for (var key in object) key = "zarathustra";
```
This would result in different behavior because it reassigns the key variable to a different constant value, which could cause errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
