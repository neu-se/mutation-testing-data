  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate as `max > 0` if `any` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any && max > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate as `any` if `max > 0` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max === 0 || any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator has higher precedence than the `>` operator, so the expression would evaluate as `max === 0` if `any` is `true`.

DONE.
