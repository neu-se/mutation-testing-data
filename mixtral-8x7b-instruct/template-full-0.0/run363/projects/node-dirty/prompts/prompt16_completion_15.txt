 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` method does not accept any arguments and removing the callback list from the queue will prevent the data from being persisted on disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.get(key).push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it will not check if the `cbs` array already exists for the given key, potentially causing duplicate callbacks and unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.set(key, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it will replace the `cbs` array with the single `cb` callback, causing other callbacks to be lost and potentially not persisting all data on disk.

DONE.
