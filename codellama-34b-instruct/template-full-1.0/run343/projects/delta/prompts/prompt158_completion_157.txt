  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would cause the `compose` method to use the length of the next operation in the `other` Delta, rather than its type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would cause the `compose` method to use the length of the first operation in the `other` Delta, regardless of its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp, otherOp)
```
This would cause the `compose` method to use the length of the current operation in the `other` Delta only if it is equal to the current operation in the `this` Delta, otherwise it would use the length of the first operation in the `other` Delta.

DONE.
