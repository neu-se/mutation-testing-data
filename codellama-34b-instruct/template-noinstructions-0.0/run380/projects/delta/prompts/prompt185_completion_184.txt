  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `otherOp.retain` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code checks if it is an object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `otherOp.retain` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code checks if it is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `other
