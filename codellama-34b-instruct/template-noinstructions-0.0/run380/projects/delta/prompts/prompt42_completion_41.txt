  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the null character, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the start of heading (SOH) character, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the start of text (STX) character, regardless of the input.

DONE.
