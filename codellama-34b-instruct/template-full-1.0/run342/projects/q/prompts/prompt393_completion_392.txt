  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always resolves the promise, regardless of the state of the `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rejects the promise, regardless of the state of the `value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.pend(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always pends the promise, regardless of the state of the `value` argument.

DONE.
