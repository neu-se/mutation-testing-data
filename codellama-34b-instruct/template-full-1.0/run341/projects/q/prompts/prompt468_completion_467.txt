  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled",
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the "rejectionHandled" event, which was not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejection",
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the "rejection" event, which was not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled",
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the "fulfilled" event, which was not the intended behavior.

DONE.
