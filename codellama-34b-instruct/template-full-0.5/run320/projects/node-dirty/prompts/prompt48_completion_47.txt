  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) + 1), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value stored at the given key by 1, rather than applying the updater function to the existing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) || 0), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a default value of 0 if the value stored at the given key is undefined, rather than applying the updater function to the existing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key).toUpperCase()), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value stored at the given key to uppercase, rather than applying the updater function to the existing value.

DONE.
