  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality, which means it will return `true` if the values are not the same, but also if they have different types. In contrast, `!isEqual(a[key], b[key])` checks for deep equality, which means it will return `true` only if the values are not the same and have the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a[key] === b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality, which means it will return `true` if the values are not the same, but also if they have different types.
