Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined` instead of checking if it has been resolved, which could allow the promise to be fulfilled even if it has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolvedPromise` is strictly equal to `null`, which would not account for other falsy values like `undefined`, potentially allowing the promise to be fulfilled when it should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined && resolvedPromise !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the promise to be fulfilled if `resolvedPromise` is any value other than `undefined` or `null`, which could lead to incorrect promise states being set.

DONE.
