Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the zoom level by 1, which would lead to different tile coordinates being calculated than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the zoom level, which would significantly alter the tile coordinates returned, potentially leading to incorrect mapping results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the zoom level by 1, which would result in a larger tile size and potentially incorrect mapping of the geographical area.

DONE.
