  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` will always return the value of the `promise` object, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected, whereas the original code fragment only returns the value of the `promise` object if it was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(null)` will always resolve to `null`, regardless of whether the `promise` object was fulfilled or rejected, whereas the original code fragment only returns the value of the `promise` object if it was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.when(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.when()` is used to resolve a promise when it is already fulfilled, whereas the original code fragment uses `promise.then()` to resolve a promise
