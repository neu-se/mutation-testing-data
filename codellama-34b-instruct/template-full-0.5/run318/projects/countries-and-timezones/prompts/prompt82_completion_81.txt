  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `getCountry` to retrieve the country object, while this replacement uses `getTimezone` to retrieve the timezone object. This would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of timezone objects instead of an array of country objects, which would likely break the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any options to `getCountry`, while this replacement passes an options object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return a deprecated country object instead of the current country object, which could potentially break the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c,
