  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.replace` would replace the entire word with "ves", while the new code fragment `w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')` would only replace the "ves" at the end of the word.

DONE.
