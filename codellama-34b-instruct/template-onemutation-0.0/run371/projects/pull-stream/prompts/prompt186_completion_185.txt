  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass `true` to the callback, while the new code fragment `cb(false)` would pass `false`. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the callback being passed `true`.

DONE.
