  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to assign a value to the `reviver` parameter, while the buggy code fragment uses the comma operator to assign the value of `options.reviver` to `data` and `null` to `options`. This would cause the `JSON.parse` method to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to assign a value to the `reviver` parameter, while the buggy code fragment uses the comma operator to assign the value of `options.reviver` to `data` and `null` to `options`. This would cause the `JSON.parse` method to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially resulting in different behavior.
