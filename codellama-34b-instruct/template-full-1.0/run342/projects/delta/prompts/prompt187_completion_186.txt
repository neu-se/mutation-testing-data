  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getAttributeMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` method to return the `AttributeMap` object instead of the `Handler` object, which would lead to errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getRetain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` method to return the `Retain` object instead of the `Handler` object, which would lead to errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getInsert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getHandler` method to return the `Insert` object instead of the `Handler` object, which would lead to errors in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
