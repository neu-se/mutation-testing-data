  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
round(a, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `round` function rounds a number to a specified number of decimals, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
