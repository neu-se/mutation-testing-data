Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of removing the specific element at index `at`, potentially leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `0` as the second argument to `splice()` does not remove any elements, effectively leaving the `unhandledReasons` array unchanged, which could lead to incorrect state management.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the element at index `at` to `null` does not remove it from the array, which could cause the array to retain a reference to a rejected reason that should have been removed.

DONE.
