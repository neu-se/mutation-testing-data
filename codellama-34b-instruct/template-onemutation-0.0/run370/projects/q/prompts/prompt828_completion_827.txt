  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) {
    throw error;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `Q.onerror` is not defined, while the new code fragment always throws an error, regardless of whether `Q.onerror` is defined.
