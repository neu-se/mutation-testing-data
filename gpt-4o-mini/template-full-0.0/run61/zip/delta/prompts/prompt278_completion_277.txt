Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from peeking at the next operation to peeking at the next operation without consuming it, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `iter` iterator instead of `otherIter`, which means it would incorrectly process the current operation from the wrong iterator, leading to unexpected results in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to peek at the current operation without advancing the iterator, which is not valid and could lead to an error or incorrect processing of the operations.

DONE.
