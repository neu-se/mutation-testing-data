  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `true` when checking if the next op is an insert, even if it's not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `true` when checking if the next op is a delete, even if it's not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `true` when checking if the next op is a retain, even if it's not.

DONE.
