  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the variable `self` from its original value (a reference to the promise object) to the value `1`, which would likely cause any subsequent code that relies on the value of `self` to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `self` from a reference to the promise object to the value of the `then` method of the promise object, which would likely cause any subsequent code that relies on the value of `self` to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self.promises
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `self` from a reference to the promise object to the value of the `promises` property of the promise object, which would likely cause any subsequent code that relies on the value of
