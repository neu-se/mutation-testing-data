  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would emit a warning event instead of an error event, which could potentially go unnoticed by the developers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would emit an informational event instead of an error event, which could potentially be ignored by the developers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would emit a debug event instead of an error event, which could potentially be ignored by the developers.

DONE.
