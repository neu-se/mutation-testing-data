Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the `uncork` method without checking if the stream is corked, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the stream is not in a corked state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the write stream immediately, preventing any further writes from being processed, which could lead to data loss or incomplete writes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(''); 
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to write an empty string to the stream, which may not trigger the expected flow of handling the queued writes and could lead to incorrect handling of the `_inFlightWrites` counter.

DONE.
