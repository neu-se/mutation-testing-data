  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `a` variable as a divisor, while the new code fragment is multiplying `a` and `b` together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `a` variable as a divisor, while the new code fragment is adding `a` and `b` together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `a` variable as a divisor, while the new code fragment is subtracting `b` from `a`.

DONE.
