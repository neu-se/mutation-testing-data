  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `_rejected()` function, instead of only executing it for functions that are actually defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `_fulfilled()` function, instead of only executing it for functions that are actually defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `_fulfilled()` function, instead of only executing it for functions that are actually defined.

DONE.
