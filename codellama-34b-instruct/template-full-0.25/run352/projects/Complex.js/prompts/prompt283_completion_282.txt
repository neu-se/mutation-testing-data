  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the complex number, while the modified code fragment calculates the negative cosine of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the complex number, while the modified code fragment calculates the arccosine of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the complex number, while the modified code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the complex number.

DONE.
