  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) + 1
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) * 2
```
This change will also cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) - 1
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not expecting this behavior.

DONE.
