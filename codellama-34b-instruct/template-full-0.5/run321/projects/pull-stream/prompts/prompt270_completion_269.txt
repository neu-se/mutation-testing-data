  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream && 'object' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `stream` variable, causing the if statement to evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream || 'object' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the if statement to evaluate to `true` if either the `stream` variable or the expression `'object' === typeof stream` is truthy. In the original code, the if statement would only evaluate to `true` if both the `stream` variable and the expression `'object' === typeof stream` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would cause the if statement to evaluate to `true` if the `stream` variable is truth
