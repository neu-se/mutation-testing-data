  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments, "Arguments", "Arguments object"]
```
This would result in different behavior because a new array would be created, and the `arguments` object would be included as a string, which may cause the `deferred.notify()` method to be called with an unexpected argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, and it would not have properties that could be accessed by the `arguments` object in the `array_slice()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed to the `deferred.notify()` method, which may cause the method to be called with fewer arguments than expected.

DONE.
