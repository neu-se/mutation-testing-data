  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `name` argument onto the `nodeArgs` array instead of the `name` argument followed by the `nodeArgs` array, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([name])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `name` argument onto the `nodeArgs` array instead of pushing it onto the array, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(name, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the `name` argument followed by the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment pushes the `name` argument onto the `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
