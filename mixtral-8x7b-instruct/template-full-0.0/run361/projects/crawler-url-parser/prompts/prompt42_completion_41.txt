 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed base URL instead of using the provided `baseUrlStr`. This could lead to incorrect URL parsing if the actual base URL is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object, which might not be initialized or might have a different value than the provided `baseUrlStr`. This could lead to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse('http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new URL object with a fixed URL instead of using the provided `baseUrlStr`. This could lead to incorrect URL parsing if the actual base URL is different.

DONE.
