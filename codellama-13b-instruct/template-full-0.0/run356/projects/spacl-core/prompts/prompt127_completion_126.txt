  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of index 0, which would cause the loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 2 instead of index 0, which would cause the loop to skip the first two elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 3 instead of index 0, which would cause the loop to skip the first three elements in the array.

DONE.
