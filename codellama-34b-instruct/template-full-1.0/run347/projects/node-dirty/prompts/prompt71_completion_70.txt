  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the load event would not fire, as the `_load` method would return before reaching the line that emits the event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the load event would not fire, as the `_load` method would return before reaching the line that emits the event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the load event would not fire, as the `_load` method would return before reaching the line that emits the event.

DONE.
