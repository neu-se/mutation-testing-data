  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._loadData
```
This would result in different behavior because `_load` is a private method that is only used to initialize the data in the constructor, while `_loadData` is a public method that is used to load data from a file. Replacing `_load` with `_loadData` would cause the constructor to attempt to load data from a file, which could result in the program crashing if the file is not present or if the program does not have permission to read the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._loadData(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_loadData` takes an optional `force` parameter that determines whether the data should be loaded from the file again, even if it was already loaded. If `force` is set to `true`, the data will be loaded from the file again, which could result in the program behavior being different if the data in the file has changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
