  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next().retain` returns the retain value of the next operation, which may not be the same as the next operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator without advancing the iterator, while `otherIter.peek().retain` returns the retain value of the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the same as the next operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next().delete` returns the delete value of the next operation, which may not be the same as the next operation itself.

DONE.
