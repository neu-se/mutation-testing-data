  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `b` is overwritten with the return value of `transform()`, whereas in the modified code, the return value of `transform()` is only used if it's not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b? a: undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `b` is only overwritten with the return value of `transform()` if it's not `undefined`, whereas in the modified code, `b` is overwritten with the return value of `transform()` regardless of whether it's `undefined` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'? a: b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `b` is only overwritten with the return value of `transform()` if it's an object, whereas in the modified code, `b` is
