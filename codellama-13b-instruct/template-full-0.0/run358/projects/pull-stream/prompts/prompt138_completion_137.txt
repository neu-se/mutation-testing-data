  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `generate()` function, while this code fragment returns the result of the `cb()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `generate()` function, while this code fragment returns the result of the `cb()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `generate()` function, while this code fragment returns the result of the `cb()` function.

DONE.
