  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise` is a class that is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the existing `deferred` object.

DONE.
