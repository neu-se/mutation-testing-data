 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow a number with a non-zero imaginary part to be treated as if it were a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, causing the parser to exit even when there are no remaining tokens.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(plus + minus)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat any non-zero value of `plus` or `minus` as if it were NaN, causing the parser to exit.

DONE.
