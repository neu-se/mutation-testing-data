 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality instead of using the `isEqual` function, which can handle nested objects and various types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.stringify(a[key]) === JSON.stringify(b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for stringified equality, which would not correctly compare nested objects or handle cases with different object structures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(a).length === Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if both objects have the same number of keys, but not if the keys or values are equal.

DONE.
