  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume` method expects a callback function to be passed as an argument, but `true` is a Boolean value and not a function. This will cause the `resume` method to throw an error, which will likely cause the overall request to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume` method expects a callback function to be passed as an argument, but `1` is a Number value and not a function. This will cause the `resume` method to throw an error, which will likely cause the overall request to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume` method expects a callback function to be passed as an argument, but the empty function `() => {}` is not a valid
