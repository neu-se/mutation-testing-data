 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'\\x01'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different escape sequence, which matches the ASCII character with the code 1 instead of the first captured group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'${1}'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses template literals, which would cause a syntax error in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
