  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite of the original function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the imaginary part is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() || this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if either the real or imaginary part is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
