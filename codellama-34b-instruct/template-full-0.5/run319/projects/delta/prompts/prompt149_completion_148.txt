  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)` call to be skipped, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)` call to be skipped, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)` call to be skipped, potentially leading to a different outcome in the `compose` method.

DONE.
