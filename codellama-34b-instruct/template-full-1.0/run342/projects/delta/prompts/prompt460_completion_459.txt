  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `this.ops` array is not necessarily the same as the `this.index` property, which is the position of the next element to be returned by the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `this.ops` array is not necessarily the same as the `this.index` property, which is the position of the next element to be returned by the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `this.ops` array is not necessarily the same as the `this.index` property, which is the position of the next element to be returned by the iterator.

DONE.
