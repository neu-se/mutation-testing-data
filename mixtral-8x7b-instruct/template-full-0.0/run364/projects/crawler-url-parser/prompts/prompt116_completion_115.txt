 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the keys of the `urlMap` instead of its values, so the `gettype` function will receive keys (URL strings) instead of `URL` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator of key/value pairs, which changes the type of the argument received by the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(urlMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of key/value pairs, which changes the type of the argument received by the `gettype` function.

DONE.
