  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](0))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the modified code fragment always returns true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the modified code fragment always returns false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](NaN))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the modified code fragment always returns false.

DONE.
