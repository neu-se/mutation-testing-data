  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `all` and would return a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the array is fulfilled, rather than when all of them are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a different method than `all` and would return a promise that is fulfilled when none of the promises in the array is fulfilled, rather than when all of them are fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a different method than `all` and would return a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the array is fulfilled, rather than when all of them are fulfilled.

DONE.
