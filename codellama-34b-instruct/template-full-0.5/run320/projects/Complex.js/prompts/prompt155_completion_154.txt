  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()) && (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are zero or infinite, while the modified code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` are zero or infinite. This would cause the `return Complex['NAN']` statement to be executed in different cases, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are zero or infinite, while the modified code fragment checks if `this` is zero and `z` is infinite, or `this` is infinite and `z` is zero. This would cause the `return Complex['NAN']` statement to
