  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operation would be performed instead of the `delete` operation, which would insert a new character at the current position instead of deleting one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would delete one more character than the original code, which could result in a different output or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would delete one fewer character than the original code, which could result in a different output or behavior.

DONE.
