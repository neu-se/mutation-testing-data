  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `policy` object with the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments, which would return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `policy` object with the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments, which would return a different result than the original code fragment.
