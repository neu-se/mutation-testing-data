  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is reversed, so the word "woman" would become "woman" instead of "women".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is the same as the original code, so the word "woman" would still become "women".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'i') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is different from the original code, so the word "woman" would become "womin" instead of "women".

DONE.
