  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different expression than `a`, and could potentially change the resulting value of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + a` is a different expression than `a`, and could potentially change the resulting value of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a different expression than `a`, and could potentially change the resulting value of the program.

DONE.
