  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and adding `.json` to it would result in a different file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and calling `toUpperCase()` on it would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and calling `split()` on it would result in an array of strings, and then taking the first element of the array would result in a different string.

DONE.
