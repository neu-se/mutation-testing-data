  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `content` is a buffer, while this code checks if it is not a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `content` is an empty buffer, while this code checks if its length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8') === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `content` is an empty string, while this code checks if its UTF-8 representation is an empty string.

DONE.
