  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This change would cause the `readFileSync` function to execute the `fs.readFileSync` function with the `options` argument as an object, even if it was originally a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is defined. This change would cause the `readFileSync` function to execute the `fs.readFileSync` function with the `options` argument as an object, even if it was originally a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because
