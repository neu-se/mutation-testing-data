  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr()
```
This would result in different behavior because `doneLackingErr` is a function, and calling it would execute the code inside the function, which would likely cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` is a method that can be used to call a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, and using it on `doneLackingErr` would likely cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply()` is a method that can be used to call a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, and using it on `doneLackingErr` would likely cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
