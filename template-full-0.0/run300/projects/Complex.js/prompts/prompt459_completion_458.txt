  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] === 0 && this['re'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere and has a non-zero real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] !== 0 && this['re'] === 0;
