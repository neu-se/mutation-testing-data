  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would flip the sign of the result, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh^2
```
This would result in different behavior because the square of the hyperbolic cosine would be greater than the original value, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a+b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument of the hyperbolic cosine would be different from the original value, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
