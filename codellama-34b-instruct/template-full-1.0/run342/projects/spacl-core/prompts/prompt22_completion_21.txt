  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string
```
This would result in different behavior because `string` is a built-in method that returns the string representation of an object, while `super[Symbol.match]` is a method that is defined on the `RegExp` class and is used to match a regular expression pattern against a given string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because `string[Symbol.match]` is a method that is defined on the `String` class and is used to match a regular expression pattern against a given string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
RegExp[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because `RegExp[Symbol.match]` is a method that is defined on the `RegExp` class and is used to match a regular expression pattern against a given string.

DONE.
