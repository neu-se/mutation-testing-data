 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume the next operation type is 'insert', which might not be the case, and could lead to incorrect index calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately execute the `peekType()` method, consuming the next operation in the iterator. This would cause the loop to skip an operation and lead to incorrect index calculations or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().type
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator and retrieve the next operation, then access its `type` property. This would cause the loop to skip an operation, leading to incorrect index calculations or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
