 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to a specific object. The original code uses `this.dispatch` directly, which allows the method to access the object's properties and methods. By using `bind`, the context of `this` within the `dispatch` method would be different, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the context of the function to the provided value. In this case, `null` is provided, which would cause `this` inside the `dispatch` method to refer to the global object (`window` in a browser environment), instead of the current object. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.hasOwnProperty('dispatch') ? this.dispatch :
