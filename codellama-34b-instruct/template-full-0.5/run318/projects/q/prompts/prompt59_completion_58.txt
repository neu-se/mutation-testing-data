  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined in the global scope, while this new code fragment checks if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string.

DONE.
