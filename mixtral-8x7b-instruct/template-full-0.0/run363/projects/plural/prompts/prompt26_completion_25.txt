 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong result for words that have a different plural form depending on their length, such as "child" and "children".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.substr(w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong result for words that have a different plural form depending on the last letter, such as "woman" and "women".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.substr(w.length - 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong result for words that have a different plural form depending on the last two letters, such as "crisis" and "crises".

DONE.
