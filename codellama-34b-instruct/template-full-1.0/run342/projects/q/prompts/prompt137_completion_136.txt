  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not defined anywhere and would throw a reference error, while the original code would evaluate to false and not throw any errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder would be different than the original code, which would change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder would be different than the original code, which would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
