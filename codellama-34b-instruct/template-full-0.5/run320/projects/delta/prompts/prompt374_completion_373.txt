  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one step, potentially skipping over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the current operation, potentially skipping over multiple operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator back one step, potentially re-reading the previous operation.

DONE.
