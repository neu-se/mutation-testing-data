  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is not being called in the original code, but it is being called in the mutated code. This could cause the `onAbort` function to be executed when it should not be, leading to unexpected behavior.
