  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['phi']` is a different property than `a['r']`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` is a different property than `a['r']`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is a different property than `a['r']`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

DONE.
