  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the third argument, instead of starting from the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the second argument, instead of starting from the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the first argument and ending at the second argument, instead of starting from the first argument and ending at the last argument.

DONE.
