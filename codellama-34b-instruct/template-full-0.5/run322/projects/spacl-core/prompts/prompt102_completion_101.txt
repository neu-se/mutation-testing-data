  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `null` instead of `ctx`, which could cause unexpected results in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `undefined` instead of `ctx`, which could cause unexpected results in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return the `PolicyMap` instance instead of `ctx`, which could cause unexpected results in the calling code.

DONE.
