  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  delta.push(other);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to be called on the `other` object instead of the `delta` object, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  other.push(delta);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to be called on the `delta` object instead of the `other` object, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  delta.insert(other);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` method to be called on the `delta` object with the `other` object as an argument, which could have unintended consequences.

DONE.
