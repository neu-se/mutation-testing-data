  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` takes two arguments, the key and the value, and returns a JSON string representation of the object. In the original code, `JSON.stringify` is called with a single argument, an object with `key` and `val` properties, which would result in a JSON string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is called with a single argument, the key, which would result in a JSON string representation of the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is called with a single argument, the value, which would result in a JSON string representation of the value.

DONE.
