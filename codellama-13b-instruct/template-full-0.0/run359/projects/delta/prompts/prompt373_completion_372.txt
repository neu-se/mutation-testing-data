  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next operation in the iterator, which could cause the test to fail if the next operation is important for the test case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two operations in the iterator, which could cause the test to fail if the next two operations are important for the test case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next three operations in the iterator, which could cause the test to fail if the next three operations are important for the test case.

DONE.
