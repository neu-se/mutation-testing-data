  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new array, whereas `push()` mutates the existing array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
