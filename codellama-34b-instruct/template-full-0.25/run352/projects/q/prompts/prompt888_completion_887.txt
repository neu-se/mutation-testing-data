  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return -1, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return NaN, regardless of the input.

DONE.
