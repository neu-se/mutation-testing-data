  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, while `null` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` performs type coercion, while `===` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a more explicit way of expressing `undefined`.

DONE.
