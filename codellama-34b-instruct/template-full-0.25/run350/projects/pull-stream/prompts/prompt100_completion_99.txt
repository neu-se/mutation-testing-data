  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null`, while `undefined` would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null`, while `0` would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null`, while `''` would return a different value.

DONE.
