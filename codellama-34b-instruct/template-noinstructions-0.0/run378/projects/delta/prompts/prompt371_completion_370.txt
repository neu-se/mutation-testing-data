  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by one, potentially skipping over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by two, potentially skipping over the next two operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(3))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by three, potentially skipping over the next three operations.

DONE.
