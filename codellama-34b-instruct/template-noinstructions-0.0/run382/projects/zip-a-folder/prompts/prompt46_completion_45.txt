  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `false`, which means that the `directory` method would not be called if the `src` parameter is a glob. However, if we replace the `false` with `true`, the `directory` method would be called even if the `src` parameter is a glob, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `false`, which means that the `directory` method would not be called if the `src` parameter is a glob. However, if we replace the `false` with `null`, the `directory` method would be called even if the `src` parameter is a glob, and it would pass `null` as the `glob` parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `
