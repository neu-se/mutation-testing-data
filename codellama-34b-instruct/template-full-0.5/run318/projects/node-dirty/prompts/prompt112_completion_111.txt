  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the buffer, potentially causing the error message to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the buffer to uppercase, potentially causing the error message to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.repeat(2)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would repeat the buffer twice, potentially causing the error message to be different.

DONE.
