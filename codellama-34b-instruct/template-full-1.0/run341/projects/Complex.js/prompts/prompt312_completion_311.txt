  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because under normal circumstances, the expression `a + b` would be a valid replacement for `a`, but in the context of these functions, it could lead to incorrect results. For example, in the `arg` function, the correct formula for calculating the angle of a complex number is `atan2(this['im'], this['re'])`, but if we replace `this['im']` with `this['im'] + this['re']`, the angle would always be off by a constant amount, resulting in incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-b
```
This would result in different behavior because under normal circumstances, the expression `a - b` would be a valid replacement for `a`, but in the context of these functions, it could lead to incorrect results. For example, in the `sin` function, the correct formula for calculating the sine of a complex number is `sin(a) * cosh(b) + i * cos(a) *
