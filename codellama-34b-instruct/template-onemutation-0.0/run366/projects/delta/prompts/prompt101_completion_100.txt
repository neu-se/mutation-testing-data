  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `pop` removes the last element. In the context of the `chop` method, `shift` would remove the first operation from the `ops` array, whereas `pop` would remove the last operation.
