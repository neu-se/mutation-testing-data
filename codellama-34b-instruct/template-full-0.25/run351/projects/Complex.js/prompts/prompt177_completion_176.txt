  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to get the absolute value of `d`, which is not the same as `a + b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to get the absolute value of `d`, which is not the same as `c * d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to get the absolute value of `d`, which is not the same as `a * b`.

DONE.
