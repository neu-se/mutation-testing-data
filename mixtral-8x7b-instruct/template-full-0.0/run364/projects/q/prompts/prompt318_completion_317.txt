 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new object that inherits from the Promise.prototype, while this change creates an object with no prototype, which may cause issues with any code that expects the object to have the Promise methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new object using the `object_create` function, while this change creates a new function, which is not an object and does not have the Promise methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new object with a specific prototype and methods, while this change creates a resolved promise, which has a different prototype and methods.

DONE.
