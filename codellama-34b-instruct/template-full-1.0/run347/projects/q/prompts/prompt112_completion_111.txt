  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.call(callback, value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to `thisp` instead of the original context object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.call(callback, value, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` would refer to the `array_map` function instead of the original context object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(value, index, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function directly instead of using the `call` method on it.

DONE.
