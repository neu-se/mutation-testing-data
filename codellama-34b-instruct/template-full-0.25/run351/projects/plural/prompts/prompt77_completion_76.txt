  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a tuple of three strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a tuple of three strings, with the third string being a duplicate of the second string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a tuple of three strings, with the third string being the same as the first string.

DONE.
