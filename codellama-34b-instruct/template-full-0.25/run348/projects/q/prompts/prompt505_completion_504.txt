  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a `this` argument, and passing `null` would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a `this` argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects a `this` argument, and passing `0` would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
