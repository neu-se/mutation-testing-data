  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, while `match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` returns a new string with the replaced matches, while `match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, while `match` returns an array of all matches.

DONE.
