  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function takes two arguments, and `a` is only one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function takes two arguments, and `b + 1` is only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function takes two arguments, and `a * b` is only one argument.

DONE.
