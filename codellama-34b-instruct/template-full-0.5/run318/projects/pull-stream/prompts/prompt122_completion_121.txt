  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(source)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function is called again, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(acc)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable is passed as an argument to the `sink` function, which could cause a different behavior in the `sink` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no
