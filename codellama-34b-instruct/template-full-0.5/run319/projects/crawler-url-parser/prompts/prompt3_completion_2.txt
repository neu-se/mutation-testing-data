  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the expression, so if `currentUrlStr` is defined, the original code would return `null`, but the mutated code would return an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string is 0 if the string is empty, but if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, the original code would return `null`, while the mutated code would return an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, so if `currentUrlStr` is an empty string or contains only whitespace, the original code would return `null`, but the mutated code would return an object.

DONE.
