  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(Δλ) * cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(Δλ) * cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)` would calculate the dot product of two vectors, which is different from the original calculation of `cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)` would calculate the cross product of two vectors, which is different from the original calculation of `cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(Δλ) * cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) + sin
