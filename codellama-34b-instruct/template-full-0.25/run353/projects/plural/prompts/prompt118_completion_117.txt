  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics", while this modified code fragment would apply the rule to words that end in "ics" and append "es" to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics", while this modified code fragment would apply the rule to words that end in "ics" and replace the "ics" with "ices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'icses') })
```
This would result in different
