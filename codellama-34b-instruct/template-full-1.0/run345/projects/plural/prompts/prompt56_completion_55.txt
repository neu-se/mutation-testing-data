  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method expects a string as the second argument, but `w.replace(regex, <PLACEHOLDER>)` returns a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves') + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 'es'` would add the string `'es'` to the end of the result of `w.replace(regex, <PLACEHOLDER>)`, which would give a different output than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, function(m) { return m.toLowerCase() + 'ves' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function` expression would return a different string value than the original code.

DONE.
