  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the path of the parsed URL as the base URL for resolving the relative URL, rather than the host and protocol of the parsed URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the host of the parsed URL as the base URL for resolving the relative URL, rather than the host and protocol of the parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol of the parsed URL as the base URL for resolving the relative URL, rather than the host and protocol of the parsed URL.

DONE.
