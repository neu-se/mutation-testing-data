  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(1)` would return a new string that omits the first character of `content`, whereas `content` would return the string as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toUpperCase()` would return a new string with all characters in uppercase, whereas `content` would return the string as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.split('').reverse().join('')` would return a new string with the characters of `content` in reverse order, whereas `content` would return the string as is.

DONE.
