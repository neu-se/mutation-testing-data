  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.all()` is a method that returns a promise for an array of the values of all the promises in the input array, whereas `this` is a reference to the current promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all(this)` is a method that returns a promise for an array of the values of all the promises in the input array, whereas `this` is a reference to the current promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(this.all())
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.all()` is a method that returns a promise for an array of the values of all the promises in the input array, whereas `Q.all(this.all())` is a method that returns a promise for an array of the values of all the promises in the input array, but the input
