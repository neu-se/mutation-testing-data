  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` expects a rejected promise to be returned, but `resolved` would return a resolved promise instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would explicitly reject the promise, whereas `rejected` would pass the rejection on to the next handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('rejected')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error('rejected')` would throw an error, whereas `rejected` would pass the rejection on to the next handler.

DONE.
