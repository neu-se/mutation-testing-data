  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return an empty object when `b` is null, whereas the original code would return `b` as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `b` as is if it is not an object, whereas the original code would return an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.hasOwnProperty('constructor')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `b` as is if it does not have a `constructor` property, whereas the original code would return an empty object.

DONE.
