  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces it with "https://", which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces it with "ftp://", which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces it with "file://", which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

DONE.
