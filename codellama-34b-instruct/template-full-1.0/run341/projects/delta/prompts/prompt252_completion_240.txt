  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `next()` advances the iterator and returns the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `peek()` method of the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which could cause the program to work differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `thisOp` variable to `null`, which could cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results when it tries to use `thisOp`.

DONE.
