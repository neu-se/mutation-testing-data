  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This code fragment will delete the key from the `_data` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This code fragment will increment the key by 1, which will cause the code to access the wrong key in the `_data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This code fragment will retrieve the value associated with the key from the `_data` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
