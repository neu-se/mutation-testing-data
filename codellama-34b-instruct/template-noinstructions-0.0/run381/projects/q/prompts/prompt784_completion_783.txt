  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to `rejected` if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to `rejected` if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the promise is rejected, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error as the reason.

DONE.
