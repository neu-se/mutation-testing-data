  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an iterator for `other.ops`, while `thisIter` is an iterator for `this.ops`. Using `otherIter.peekType` would cause the algorithm to consider the types of operations in the `other` delta, rather than the types of operations in the `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the current operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the current operation. Using `peekLength` would cause the algorithm to consider the lengths of the operations, rather than their types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength` would return the length of the current operation in the `other` delta, while `thisIter
