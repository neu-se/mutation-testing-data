  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in a string, while `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the string contains the specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, while `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the string contains the specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` with a second argument of 0 would check if the string contains the specified value at the beginning of the string, while the original code fragment would check if the string contains the specified value anywhere in the string.

DONE.
