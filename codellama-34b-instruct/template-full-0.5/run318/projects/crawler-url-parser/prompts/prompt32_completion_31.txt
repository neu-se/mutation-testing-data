  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol would be changed from HTTP to HTTPS, which could cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the domain would be prefixed with "www.", which could cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the domain would be replaced with "example.com", which could cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

DONE.
