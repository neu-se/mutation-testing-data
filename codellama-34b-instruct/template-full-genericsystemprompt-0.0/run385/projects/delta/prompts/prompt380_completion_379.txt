  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over one additional operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the transformed delta to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include one additional operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the transformed delta to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include twice as many operations in the other iterator, potentially causing the transformed delta to be incorrect.

DONE.
