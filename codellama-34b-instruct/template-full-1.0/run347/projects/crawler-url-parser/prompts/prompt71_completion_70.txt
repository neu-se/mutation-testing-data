  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 $+ $('a').eq(i).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is used to retrieve the link's `href` attribute, which is not the same as the original code fragment `data`. This buggy code fragment would cause the function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').eq(i).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` method is used to retrieve the link's text content, which is not the same as the original code fragment `data`. This buggy code fragment would cause the function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').eq(i).not('[href]').text()
