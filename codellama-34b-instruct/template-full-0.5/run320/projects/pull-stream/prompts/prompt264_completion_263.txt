  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
