  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the word "die" to the list of exceptions, while the modified code fragment adds the word "dies" to the list of exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', function() { return 'dies'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the word "die" to the list of exceptions, while the modified code fragment adds the word "dies" to the list of exceptions, but also defines a function that returns the word "dies" regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('died', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the word "die" to the list of exceptions, while the modified code fragment adds the word "died" to the list of exceptions.

DONE.
