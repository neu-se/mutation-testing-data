  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to `policy`, rather than adding a new entry to the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to `null`, rather than adding a new entry to the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to `undefined`, rather than adding a new entry to the map.

DONE.
