```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different pattern in the URL. In the original code, the regular expression matches the fragment identifier, which is the portion of the URL after the `#` symbol. In this modified code, the regular expression matches any sequence of characters after the `#` symbol, including the empty string, which would remove the entire fragment identifier from the URL.

This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different pattern in the URL. In the original code, the regular expression matches the fragment identifier, which is the portion of the URL after the `#` symbol. In this modified code, the regular expression matches any sequence of characters after the `#` symbol, including the empty string, and replaces it with the string `'company'`, which would change the
