  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the value of `progress` by 1, which would cause the `notify` method to send a different value to the progress listeners.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the value of `progress` by 1, which would cause the `notify` method to send a different value to the progress listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `progress` by 2, which would cause the `notify` method to send a different value to the progress listeners.

DONE.
