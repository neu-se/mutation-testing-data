  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string describing the type of the operand, so this code would always return the string "object".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is an object, so adding 1 to it would return a new object with a property that is 1 more than the original object's property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a reserved word in JavaScript, so it cannot be used as a property name. Attempting to access this property would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
