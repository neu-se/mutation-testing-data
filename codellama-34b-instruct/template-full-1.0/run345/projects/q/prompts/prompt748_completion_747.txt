  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.reject would reject the promise instead of resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.notify would cause the promise to be rejected with the current progress instead of being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.somethingElse
```
This would result in different behavior because there is no method called `somethingElse` in the deferred object, which would cause an error to be thrown and the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
