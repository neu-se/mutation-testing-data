  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Q(makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)).delay(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method would introduce an additional asynchronous operation, causing the `Q.async` function to return a promise that resolves after an additional tick of the event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Q(makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)).all();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method would return a promise that resolves when all the promises in the array returned by `makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)` are fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Q(makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first promise in the array returned by `makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)`.

DONE.
