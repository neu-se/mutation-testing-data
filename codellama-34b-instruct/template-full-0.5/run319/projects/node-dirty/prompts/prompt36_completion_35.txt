  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in this._data) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop iterates over the properties of an object in an arbitrary order, while the original `for...of` loop iterates over the values of an object in the order they were added.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(this._data)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs, while the original code uses a `Map` object and iterates over its entries using `for...of`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of Object.keys(this._data)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys, while the original code uses a `Map` object and iterates over its keys using `for...of`.

DONE.
