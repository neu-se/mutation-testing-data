  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` type is not checked in the original code, and it would cause the `index` to be updated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` flag is not considered in the original code, and it would cause the `index` to be updated differently when `nextType` is `insert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` type is explicitly checked in the original code, and it would cause the `index` to be updated differently when `nextType` is not `delete`.

DONE.
