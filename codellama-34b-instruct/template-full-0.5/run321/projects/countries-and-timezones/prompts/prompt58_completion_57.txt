  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function from `memoizeCountry`, and it may not have the same side effects or behavior as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` is a different function from `memoizeCountry`, and it may not have the same side effects or behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` is a different function from `memoizeCountry`, and it may not have the same side effects or behavior as the original code.

DONE.
