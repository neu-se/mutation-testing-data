  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a + 1` is a real number. The `acosh` function expects a complex number as input, and the behavior of the function would be different if a real number was provided.
