Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the callback to be called with `aborted` when it is not aborted, which could lead to incorrect handling of the abort state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the `end` variable instead of `aborted`, which would cause the function to incorrectly handle the end of the stream instead of the abort condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `data` is truthy instead of checking the `aborted` state, which could lead to the callback being called with `aborted` when there is valid data, potentially causing confusion in the flow of data processing.

DONE.
