  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([this, that])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that is resolved when all of the input promises are resolved, while the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved when either of the input promises is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race([this, that])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` returns a promise that is resolved when the first of the input promises is resolved, while the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved when both of the input promises are resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.join(this, that)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.join` returns a promise that is resolved when both of the input promises are resolved and have the same value, while the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved when either of the input promises is resolved.

DONE.
