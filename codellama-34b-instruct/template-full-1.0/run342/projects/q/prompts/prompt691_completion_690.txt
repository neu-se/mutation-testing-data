  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is not the same as `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` is not the same as `array_slice(arguments)`.

DONE.
