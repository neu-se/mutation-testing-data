  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof undefined` is different from `typeof data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof null` is different from `typeof data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof "random string"` is different from `typeof data`.

DONE.
