  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because in node.js, the `exports` variable is typically set to an object, but if it is not defined, it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a shortcut for `void (0)`, which returns `undefined`, so the code would be checking if `exports` is `undefined` instead of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null && typeof exports === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the code to short-circuit and return `null` if the left-hand side operand is falsy, instead of checking if `exports` is an object.

DONE.
