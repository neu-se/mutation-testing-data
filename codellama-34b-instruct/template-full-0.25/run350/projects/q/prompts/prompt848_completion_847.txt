  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but it is not being called as a function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that refers to a deferred object, but it is not being used as a function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but it is not being called as a function in the original code.

DONE.
