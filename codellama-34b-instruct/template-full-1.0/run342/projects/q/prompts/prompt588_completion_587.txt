  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning the result of the generator function, it would return null, causing the promise returned by `spawn` to resolve with the value null, regardless of the actual return value of the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("unknown error");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning the result of the generator function, it would throw an error, causing the promise returned by `spawn` to reject with the error, regardless of the actual return value of the generator function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning the result of the generator function, it would return undefined, causing the promise returned by `spawn` to resolve with the value undefined, regardless of the actual return value of the generator function.

DONE.
