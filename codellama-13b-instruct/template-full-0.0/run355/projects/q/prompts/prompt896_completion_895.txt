  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while the modified code fragment uses the `defer` function to create a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deferred` variable, which is defined in the outer scope, while the modified code fragment uses the `defer` function to create a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `defer` function to create a new deferred object, while the modified code fragment uses the `Q.defer` function to create a new deferred object.

DONE.
