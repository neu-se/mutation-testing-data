 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$("body a")'
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects all `a` elements within the `body` instead of the current selection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects only `a` elements with an `href` attribute, excluding any without an `href`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"input[type='text']"
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects `input` elements with a `type` attribute of `"text"`, which may not be the intended selection.

DONE.
