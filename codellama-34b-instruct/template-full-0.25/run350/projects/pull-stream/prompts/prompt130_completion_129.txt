  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when the `end` parameter is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return `0` instead of `null` when the `end` parameter is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return `NaN` instead of `null` when the `end` parameter is not provided.

DONE.
