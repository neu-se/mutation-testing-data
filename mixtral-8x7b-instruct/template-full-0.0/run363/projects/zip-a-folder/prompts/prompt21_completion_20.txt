 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends './' to the targetFilePath, which might cause issues if the path is already absolute or if the './' is not desired.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd() + '/' + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends the current working directory to the targetFilePath, which might cause issues if the path is already absolute or if the developer doesn't expect this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetFilePath || 'default.tar.gz'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a default value if targetFilePath is falsy, which might not be desired and could lead to unexpected results if the developer relies on the original behavior of throwing an error when targetFilePath is not provided.

DONE.
