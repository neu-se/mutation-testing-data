 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the input value of `θ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the calculated value of `θ`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the longitude value of the current object, instead of the calculated value of `θ`.

DONE.
