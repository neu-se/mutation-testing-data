  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test Error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which would trigger the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill(new Error("Test Error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a new error object, which would not trigger the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(new Error("Test Error"), function (reason) {
    console.log("Reason:", reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which would trigger the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism, but it would also provide a way to handle the rejection by logging the reason.

DONE.
