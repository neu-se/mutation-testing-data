  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with an empty `attributes` object, which could cause it to behave differently than when it is called with the actual `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, { foo: 'bar' }, i);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with a non-empty `attributes` object, which could cause it to behave differently than when it is called with the actual `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, { foo: 'bar' }, i + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with a non-empty `attributes` object and an incremented `i` value, which could cause it to behave differently than when it is called with the actual `attributes` object
