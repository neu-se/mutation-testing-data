Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow attributes from `b` to overwrite those in `a` when `a[key]` is `undefined`, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat both `null` and `undefined` as equivalent, allowing keys from `a` to be added to `attributes` even if they are `null`, which differs from the original check for `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the addition of keys from `a` to `attributes` if the corresponding key in `b` is `null`, which is not the case in the original logic that checks for `undefined`.

DONE.
