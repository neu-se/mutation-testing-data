  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` to the `parse` function, which would then be used as the `baseUrl` for the `URL.resolve` method, potentially causing the `currentUrl` to be resolved relative to the wrong base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `currentUrlStr` to the `parse` function, which would then be used as the `currentUrl` for the `URL.resolve` method, potentially causing the `currentUrl` to be resolved relative to the wrong URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `embedBaseUrlStr` to the `parse` function, which would then be used as the `embedBaseUrl` for the `URL.resolve` method
