  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("foo", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the argument `foo`, instead of `apply`, which would cause the code to execute a different branch of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, []])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the argument `void 0`, which would cause the code to execute a different branch of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).prop("apply", [void 0, []])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` method is called, which would cause the code to execute a different branch of the `prop` method.

DONE.
