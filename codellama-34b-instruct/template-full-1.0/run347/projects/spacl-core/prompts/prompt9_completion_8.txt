  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```/\//```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match any string that contains a `/` character, rather than only matching strings that contain exactly two `/` characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```/[/]*/```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match any string that contains zero or more occurrences of the `/` character, rather than only matching strings that contain exactly two `/` characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``/[^/]+/```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match any string that contains at least one non-`/` character, rather than only matching strings that contain exactly two `/` characters.

DONE.
