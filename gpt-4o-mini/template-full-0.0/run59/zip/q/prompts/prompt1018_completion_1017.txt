Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with an error, it would resolve the promise, potentially leading to incorrect handling of errors in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new custom error message instead of the original error, which could change how the error is handled downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a `null` value, which is not a valid error and could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise chain, as it would not provide any meaningful error information.

DONE.
