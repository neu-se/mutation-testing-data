  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function has a different output than the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function has a different output than the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function has a different output than the `1 / cosh(b)` expression.

DONE.
