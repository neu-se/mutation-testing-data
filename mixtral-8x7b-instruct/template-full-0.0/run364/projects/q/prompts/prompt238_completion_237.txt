 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new (always rejected) promise instead of resolving to the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Replacement error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately rejects the promise with a new error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the value in a different promise implementation, potentially changing the behavior of the promise chain.

DONE.
