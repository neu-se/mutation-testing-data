  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a fulfilled promise, while this code would return a rejected promise. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a fulfilled promise with the original value, while this code would return a fulfilled promise with the value null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a fulfilled promise with the original value, while this code would return an undefined value.  

DONE.
