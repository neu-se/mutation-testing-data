  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of a function call, the null value would be returned, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete deferred.makeNodeResolver;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the makeNodeResolver method, the method itself would be deleted, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string';
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of a function call, the string value would be returned, causing an error.

DONE.
