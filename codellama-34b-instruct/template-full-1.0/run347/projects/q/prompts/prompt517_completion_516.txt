  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the test to fail differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the test to fail differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arbitraryValue
```
This would result in different behavior because an arbitrary value would be passed to the `resolve` method instead of a reference to the `deferred` object, which would cause the test to fail differently.

DONE.
