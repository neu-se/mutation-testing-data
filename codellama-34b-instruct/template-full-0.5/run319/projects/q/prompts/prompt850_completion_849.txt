  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `error` is truthy and of type string, whereas the original code checks if `error` is falsy or a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `error` is falsy and of type string, whereas the original code checks if `error` is truthy or a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `error` is truthy or of type string, whereas the original code checks if `error` is falsy or a string.

DONE.
