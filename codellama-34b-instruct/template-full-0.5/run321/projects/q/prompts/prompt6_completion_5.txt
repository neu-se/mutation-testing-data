  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" || typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `else if` block if `exports` and `module` are not objects, rather than the `if` block if they are objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "string" && typeof module === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `exports` and `module` are strings, rather than objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `exports` is an object, but `module` is not.

DONE.
