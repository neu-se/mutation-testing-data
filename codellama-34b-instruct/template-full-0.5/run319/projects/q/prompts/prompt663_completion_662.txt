  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the second argument to `array_slice` is `1`, which means that the first argument of the `post` method is not included in the slice. However, in the modified code, the second argument is `2`, which means that the first argument is included in the slice, resulting in a different argument list being passed to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the second argument to `array_slice` is `1`, which means that the first two arguments of the `post` method are not included in the slice. However, in the modified code, the second argument is `3`, which means that the first two arguments are included in the slice, resulting in a different argument list being passed to the `post` method.
