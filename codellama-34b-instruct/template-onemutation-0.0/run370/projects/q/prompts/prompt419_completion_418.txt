  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.state` is a property that is not defined. In the original code, `this.inspect` is called as a function, which returns an object with a `state` property. However, in the modified code, `this.inspect.state` is not defined, which would cause an error.

DONE.
