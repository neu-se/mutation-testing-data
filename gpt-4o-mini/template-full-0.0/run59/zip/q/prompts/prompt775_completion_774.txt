Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the `Q` library to the native `Promise` object, which may not have the same methods or properties as `Q`, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `Q` with `null` would cause the promise to attempt to resolve `null`, which is not a valid promise, leading to a rejection instead of the expected behavior of inspecting a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `Q` would also lead to an attempt to inspect an undefined value, which would not behave as a promise and would likely result in an error or rejection.

DONE.
