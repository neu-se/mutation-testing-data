 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|indice/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second alternative of the regular expression from "index" to "indice", which is not the correct plural form of the word in English.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|index|testis/i
