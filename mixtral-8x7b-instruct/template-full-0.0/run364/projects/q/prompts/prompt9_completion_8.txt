 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would not be checked for existence, and `true` would always be used as the module format, which could cause issues if the environment does not support it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `define` function to be used as the module format, which could cause issues if the environment does not support it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return { foo: 'bar' } }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of checking for the existence of the `define` function, a new object would be assigned to the `define` variable, which would cause the module to not be loaded correctly and could cause issues in the rest of the code.

DONE.
