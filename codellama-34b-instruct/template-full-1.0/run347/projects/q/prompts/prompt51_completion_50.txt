  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would be called immediately, whereas in the original code it is only called after the current task is complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(requestTick, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would delay the execution of `requestTick` by at least 1 millisecond, whereas in the original code it is called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would be called with an argument of 1, whereas in the original code it is called without any arguments.

DONE.
