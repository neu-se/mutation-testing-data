  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise immediately, instead of rejecting it, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, instead of being rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the thrown error, instead of being rejected with the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message, instead of rejecting it with the original error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message, instead of being rejected with the original error.

DONE.
