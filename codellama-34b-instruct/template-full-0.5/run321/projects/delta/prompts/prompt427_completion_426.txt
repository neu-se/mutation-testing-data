  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it's a string. If `op.retain` is a string, the code would return 1, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it's equal to 0. If `op.retain` is 0, the code would return 1, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it's greater than 0. If `op.retain
