  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get(options.url)
```
This code fragment is a buggy replacement for the original `request` function call, as it uses the `get` method instead of the `request` method. This will cause the function to return a different value, which may not be what the caller expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url)

```
This code fragment is yet another buggy replacement for the original `request` function call, as it uses the `put` method instead of the `request` method. This will cause the function to return a different value, which may not be what the caller
