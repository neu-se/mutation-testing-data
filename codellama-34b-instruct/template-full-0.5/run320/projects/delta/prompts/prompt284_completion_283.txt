  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because in JavaScript, the newline character is represented by the escape sequence `\n`, not `\r\n`. Using `\r\n` would result in a different string being produced, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\r\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because in JavaScript, the backslash character is used to escape special characters in strings. Using `\\r\\n` would result in a string that contains the literal characters `\r\n`, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<br>'
```
This would result in different behavior because in HTML, the `<br>` tag is used to create a line break, not the `\n` or `\r\n` escape sequences. Using `<br>` would result in a different HTML structure, which could affect the layout and formatting of the page.
