Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.merge
```
This would result in different behavior because `merge` might combine attributes instead of inverting them, leading to incorrect attribute handling during the transformation process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` may apply a different transformation logic to the attributes rather than inverting them, potentially causing mismatches in expected attribute states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.copy
```
This would result in different behavior because `copy` would create a duplicate of the attributes instead of inverting them, which would not reflect the intended logic of reversing the attributes' effects in the delta operation.

DONE.
