  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\` character to match the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\d'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\d` character class to match any digit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\w` character class to match any word character.

DONE.
