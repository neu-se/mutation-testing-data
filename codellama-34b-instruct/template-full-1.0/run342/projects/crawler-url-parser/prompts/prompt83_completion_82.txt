  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the element's parent node instead of the element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the element's parent node instead of the element itself, and it would also invoke the `parent()` function on the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$("a")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return all `<a>` elements on the page instead of the current element being iterated over.

DONE.
