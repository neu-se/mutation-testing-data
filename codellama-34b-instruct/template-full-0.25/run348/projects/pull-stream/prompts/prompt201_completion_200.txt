  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` calls the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` error, which may have a different effect on the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `err` error, while the new code fragment `abortCb(err)` calls the `abortCb` function with the `err` error, which may have a different effect on the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `
