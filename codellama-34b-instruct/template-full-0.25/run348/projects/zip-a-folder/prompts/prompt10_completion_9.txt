  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called even if the `src` parameter is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called twice, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called with a second argument of `true`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
