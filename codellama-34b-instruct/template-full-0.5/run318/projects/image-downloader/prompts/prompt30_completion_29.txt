  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimLeft` and `trimRight` have different effects on the URL string. `trimLeft` removes whitespace from the beginning of the string, while `trimRight` removes whitespace from the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new string that is a substring of the original string, starting from the second character. This would change the URL and potentially cause the request to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` returns a new string with all lowercase characters converted to uppercase. This could potentially cause the request to fail if the URL is case-sensitive.

DONE.
