Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
";"
```
This would result in different behavior because using a semicolon would concatenate the stack traces without any line breaks, making it difficult to read and understand the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" | "
```
This would result in different behavior because using a pipe character as a separator would change the visual format of the stack trace, potentially making it harder to distinguish between different stack frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"---"
```
This would result in different behavior because using dashes as a separator would create a visual break in the stack trace that could mislead developers into thinking there is a significant separation between stack frames when there is not.

DONE.
