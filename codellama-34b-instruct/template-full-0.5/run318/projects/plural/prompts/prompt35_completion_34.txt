  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word is being reduced by one, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word is being increased by one, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word is being doubled, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

DONE.
