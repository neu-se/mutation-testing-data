  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise library would interpret null as a resolved promise, instead of a rejected one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise library would interpret undefined as a resolved promise, instead of a rejected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise library would interpret 0 as a resolved promise, instead of a rejected one.

DONE.
