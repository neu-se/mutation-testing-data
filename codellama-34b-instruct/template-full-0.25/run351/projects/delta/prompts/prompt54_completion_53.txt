  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `ops` is not an empty array, even if it's not an array at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `ops` is not an empty array, even if it's not an array at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object' && ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `ops` is an array with at least one element, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
