  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the `key` in the `_queue` map to a list of callbacks, while this replacement sets it to an empty array. This could cause the `set` method to not properly queue up the callbacks for later execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the `key` in the `_queue` map to a list of callbacks, while this replacement sets it to `null`. This could cause the `set` method to not properly queue up the callbacks for later execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the `key` in the `_queue` map to a list of
