  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` would always return `true`, even if the argument is a finite number. This would cause the `if` block to execute when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite()` would always return `false`, even if the argument is a finite number. This would cause the `if` block to execute when it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite
```

DONE.
