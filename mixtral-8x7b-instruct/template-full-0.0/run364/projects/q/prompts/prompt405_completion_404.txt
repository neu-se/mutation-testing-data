 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise` is the built-in constructor for promises, while `Q` is an external library. Using `Promise` instead of `Q` would bypass the custom behavior and methods provided by the `Q` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, while the original code uses `<PLACEHOLDER>` to throw an exception. This change would cause the promise to be rejected immediately with a reason, instead of waiting for the exception to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Replacement error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error instead of the original reason. This change would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than the one intended in the original code.

DONE.
