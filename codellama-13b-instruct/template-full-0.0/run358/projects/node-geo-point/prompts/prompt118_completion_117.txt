  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the distance would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by 1 meter in the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the distance would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by 1 meter in the opposite direction of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of the distance by 2 would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by 2 times the distance in the direction of the bearing.

DONE.
