  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allSettled" is not a valid method for a promise, while "allResolved" is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "fulfilled" is not a valid method for a promise, while "allResolved" is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "rejected" is not a valid method for a promise, while "allResolved" is.

DONE.
