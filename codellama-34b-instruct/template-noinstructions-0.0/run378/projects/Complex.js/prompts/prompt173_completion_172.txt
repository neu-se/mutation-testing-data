  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, while the new code checks if `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is zero, while the new code checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is zero, while the new code checks if `z` is equal to the complex number `0 + 0i`.

DONE.
