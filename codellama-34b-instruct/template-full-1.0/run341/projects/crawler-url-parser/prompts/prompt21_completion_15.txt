  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be used as the protocol instead of "http://", which could cause the URL to be interpreted as a relative URL instead of an absolute URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because "https://" would be used as the protocol instead of "http://", which could cause the URL to be interpreted as a secure URL instead of an insecure URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined would be used as the protocol instead of "http://", which could cause the URL to be interpreted as a protocol-relative URL instead of an absolute URL.

DONE.
