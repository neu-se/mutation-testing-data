  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when all data has been flushed to the underlying system, whereas the `close` event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying resources (a file descriptor, for example) have been closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when there is no more data to be consumed from the stream, whereas the `close` event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying resources have been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs in the stream, whereas the `close` event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying resources have been closed.

DONE.
