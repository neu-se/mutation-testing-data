  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop, as `b` is always equal to `2 * a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the same value, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, depending on the input.

DONE.
