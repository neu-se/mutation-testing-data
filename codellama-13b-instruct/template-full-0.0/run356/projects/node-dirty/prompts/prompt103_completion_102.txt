  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would be called on the `key` property of the `row` object, which would cause the key to be converted to uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would be called on the `key` property of the `row` object, which would cause the key to be converted to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `key` property of the `row` object would be accessed, which would cause the length of the key to be returned.

DONE.
