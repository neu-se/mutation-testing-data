  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.splice` removes and replaces elements in the array, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.concat` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the elements of the array with the elements of one or more other arrays, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
