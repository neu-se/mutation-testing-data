  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary negation operator changes the sign of the value, which is not the intended behavior for this code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the value changes the result of the calculation, which is not the intended behavior for this code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing the value by 2 changes the result of the calculation, which is not the intended behavior for this code.

DONE.
