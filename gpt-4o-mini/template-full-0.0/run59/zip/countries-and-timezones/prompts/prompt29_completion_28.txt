Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly multiplies the offset by 60 instead of dividing it, leading to an incorrect calculation of hours.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 30
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the offset by 30 instead of 60, which would yield a value that is twice as large as intended for the hours calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 60 to the offset instead of converting it to hours, resulting in an incorrect representation of the time offset.

DONE.
