  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second operation in the `other` delta, rather than the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last operation in the `other` delta, rather than the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * other.ops.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random operation from the `other` delta, rather than the first.

DONE.
