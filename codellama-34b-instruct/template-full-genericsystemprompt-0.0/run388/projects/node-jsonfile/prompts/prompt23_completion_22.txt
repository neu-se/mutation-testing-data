  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the content, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the content to uppercase, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the content into an array of individual characters, which could potentially change the JSON parsing result.

DONE.
