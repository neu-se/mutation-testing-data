 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new URL` creates a `URL` object, while `URL.parse` returns a parsed object. This could lead to differences in the structure or behavior of the resulting object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('url').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly requires the `url` module and calls its `parse` function, rather than using the global `URL.parse` function. This could lead to differences in behavior if the `url` module has been modified or if there are multiple versions of the module in use.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly uses the global `URL` object and calls its `parse` function, rather than using the local `URL.parse` function. This could lead to differences in behavior if the global
