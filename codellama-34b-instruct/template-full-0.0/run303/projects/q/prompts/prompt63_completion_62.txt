  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `nextTick` method, unlike `window`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `nextTick` method, unlike `window`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
document
```
This would result in different behavior because `document` is an object and has a `nextTick` method, but it is not the same method as `window.nextTick`.

DONE.
