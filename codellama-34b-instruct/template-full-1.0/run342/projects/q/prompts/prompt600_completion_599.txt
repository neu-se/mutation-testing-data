  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the 'op' and 'args' strings to be concatenated, rather than passing them as separate arguments to the 'dispatch' method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"op", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the 'args' array as a single argument to the 'dispatch' method, rather than as multiple arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, [op, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass 'null' as the first argument to the 'dispatch' method, rather than passing 'op' as the first argument and 'args' as the second argument.

DONE.
