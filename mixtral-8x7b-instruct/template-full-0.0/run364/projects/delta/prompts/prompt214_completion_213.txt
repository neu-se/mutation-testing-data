 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.slice(1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the second element of the `other.ops.slice(1)` array instead of the first element of the `other.ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the second element of the `other.ops` array instead of the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops[0].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `retain` property of the first element of the `other.ops` array, instead of the element itself.

DONE.
