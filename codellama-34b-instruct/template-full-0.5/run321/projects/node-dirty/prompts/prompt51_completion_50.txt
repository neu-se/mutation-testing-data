  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `updater` function to be called with the value of the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `updater` function to be called with the value of the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `updater` function to be called with the key, rather than the value of the key.

DONE.
