  Sure! Here are my three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `return this.push(newOp);`.

This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is already pushed to the ops array in the previous line, so pushing it again would cause it to be duplicated in the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `return this.push({ retain: length });`.

This would result in different behavior because `{ retain: length }` is a different object than `newOp`, so the `length` property of `newOp` would not be preserved in the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `return this.push({ insert: arg });`.

This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a different object than `newOp`, so the `insert` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause different behavior.

DONE.
