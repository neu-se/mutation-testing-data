Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last argument with `null`, which could lead to unexpected results when the function is called, as it may not handle `null` as a valid input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it duplicates the second argument instead of using the third argument, which could change the output of the function if the second argument has a different effect than the third.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[0], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first argument twice instead of the second, which could alter the intended logic of the function if the first argument has a different effect than the second.

DONE.
