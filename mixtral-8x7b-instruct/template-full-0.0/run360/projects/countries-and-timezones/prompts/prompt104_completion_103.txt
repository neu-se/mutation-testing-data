 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ [key]: tzs[key], deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an unexpected property `deprecated` to the returned object, which was not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ [key]: tzs[key + 1] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the property of `tzs` with an incremented index, which may not exist, causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ [key]: tzs[key].name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns only the `name` property of the timezone object, instead of the entire object, which may cause issues in the code that relies on the original structure.

DONE.
