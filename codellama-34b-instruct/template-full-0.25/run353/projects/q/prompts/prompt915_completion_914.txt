  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function. In the original code, `defer` is called without any arguments, which means it will create a new deferred object with the default behavior. However, if we pass `null` as an argument, it will throw a `TypeError` because `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `function() {}` is not a valid deferred object. In the original code, `defer` is called without any arguments, which means it will create a new deferred object with the default behavior. However, if we pass a function as an argument, it will create a new deferred object with the behavior defined by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
