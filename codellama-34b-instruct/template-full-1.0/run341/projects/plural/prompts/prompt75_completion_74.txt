  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"die" + "s"
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would be "dies", which is not the correct plural form for the word "die".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"die".slice(0, -1) + "ies"
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would be "dies", which is not the correct plural form for the word "die".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"die".split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would be "ied", which is not the correct plural form for the word "die".

DONE.
