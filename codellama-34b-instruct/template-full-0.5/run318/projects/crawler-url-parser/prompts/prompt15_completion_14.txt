  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` anchor matches the start of the string, while the original code fragment matches the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` makes the match non-greedy, so it will match the first `#` character and then stop, while the original code fragment matches the last `#` character and everything after it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*?(?!#)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative lookahead `(?!#)` ensures that the match does not include another `#` character, so it will match the first `#` character and everything after it until the end of the string, while the original code fragment matches the last `#` character and everything after it.

DONE.
