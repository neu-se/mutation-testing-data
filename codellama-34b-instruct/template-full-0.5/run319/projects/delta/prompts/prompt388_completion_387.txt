  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called with a placeholder argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called with a placeholder argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the minimum of the two lengths, even if the lengths are different, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary.

DONE.
