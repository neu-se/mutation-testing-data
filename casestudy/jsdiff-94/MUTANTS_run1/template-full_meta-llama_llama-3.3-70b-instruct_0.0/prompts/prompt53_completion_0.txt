Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `oldEOFNewline` is true and `noNlBeforeAdds` is true, instead of checking if `oldEOFNewline` is false and `noNlBeforeAdds` is true, which would lead to incorrect handling of newline characters at the end of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!newEOFNewline && !noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `newEOFNewline` is false and `noNlBeforeAdds` is false, instead of checking if `oldEOFNewline` is false and `noNlBeforeAdds` is true, which would lead to incorrect handling of newline characters at the end of the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline || noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if either `oldEOFNewline
