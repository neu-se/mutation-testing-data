  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment always returns `null`, regardless of the value of `err`. In contrast, the original code fragment only returns `null` if `err` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment returns `err` if it is false, whereas the original code fragment always returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment returns `err` if it is truthy, whereas the original code fragment only returns `null` if `err` is true.

DONE.
