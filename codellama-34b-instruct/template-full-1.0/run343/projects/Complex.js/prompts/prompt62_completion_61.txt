  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is always truthy, whereas `a['phi']` may be falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` may be truthy or falsy, whereas `a['phi']` is always falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === b` checks for strict equality, whereas `a['phi']` checks for the presence of a property.

Note that these examples are not meant to be a comprehensive list of all possible buggy replacements for `a['phi']`, but rather a few examples to illustrate the principles of mutation testing.

DONE.
