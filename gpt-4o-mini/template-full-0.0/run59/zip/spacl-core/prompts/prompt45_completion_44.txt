Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.{0,1}/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for an empty capture (i.e., a colon followed by zero characters), which would not be valid in the original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.includes(':') && part.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a colon and ensures that there is at least one character after it, which is a different condition than the original regex match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original condition, meaning it would incorrectly identify parts that should be valid captures as invalid, leading to erroneous behavior in the matcher.

DONE.
