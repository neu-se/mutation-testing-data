Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of error thrown from a `SyntaxError` to a generic `Error`, which may not be caught by tests expecting a `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 'Invalid Param';
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a string instead of an error object, which would not be caught by typical error handling mechanisms that expect an instance of `Error`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of error thrown from a `SyntaxError` to a `TypeError`, which may lead to different error handling paths in the test suite.

DONE.
