  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (inspection) {
    return inspection.value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise, rather than the promise itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (inspection) {
    return inspection.reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason for the promise's rejection, rather than the promise itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (inspection) {
    return inspection.state;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise, rather than the promise itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
