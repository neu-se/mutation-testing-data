  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 * places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the multiplication operator `*` to have higher precedence than the logical OR operator `||`, resulting in a different value for `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 + places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the addition operator `+` to have higher precedence than the logical OR operator `||`, resulting in a different value for `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 + places ? 0 : places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the ternary operator `?: ` to have higher precedence than the logical OR operator `||`, resulting in a different value for `places`.

DONE.
