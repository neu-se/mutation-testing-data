  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because now the check for "z is zero" is being made using strict equality instead of using the `isZero()` method, and it would return `False` for all complex numbers with zero real and imaginary parts, instead of only for the number `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.real == 0 && z.imag == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because now the check for "z is zero" is being made using bitwise equality for both the real and imaginary parts, and it would return `True` only if both parts are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.equals(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because now the check for "z is zero" is being made using the `equals()` method of the `Complex` class, which would return `True` only if all the fields in the `Complex` object are
