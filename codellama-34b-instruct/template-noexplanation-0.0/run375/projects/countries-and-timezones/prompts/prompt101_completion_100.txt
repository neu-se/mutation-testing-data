  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original code fragment, which means that it will have the opposite behavior. If the original code fragment was checking if a timezone was not deprecated, this code fragment will check if a timezone is deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated === true
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it explicitly checks if the `deprecated` property of the timezone object is equal to `true`. This can help to avoid any potential issues with the `!` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated === true
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original code fragment, but it explicitly checks if the `deprecated` property of the timezone object is not equal to `true`. This can help to avoid any potential issues with the `!` operator.

DONE.
