  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and the original code fragment `exception` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and the original code fragment `exception` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"error"` is a string, and the original code fragment `exception` is not.

DONE.
