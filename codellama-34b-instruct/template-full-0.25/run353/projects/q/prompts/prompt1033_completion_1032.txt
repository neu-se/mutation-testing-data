  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an instance of `Error`, whereas `error` is an instance of `Error`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the stack trace would also be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of `Error`, whereas `error` is an instance of `Error`.

DONE.
