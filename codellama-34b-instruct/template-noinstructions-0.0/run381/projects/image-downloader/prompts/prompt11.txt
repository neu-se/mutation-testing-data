Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
const path = require('path');
const request = require('./lib/request');

module.exports.image = ({ extractFilename = true, ...options } = {}) => {
  if (!options.url) {
    return Promise.reject(new Error('The options.url is required'));
  }

  if (!options.dest) {
    return Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required'));
  }

  if (extractFilename) {
    if (!path.extname(options.dest)) {
      const url = new URL(options.url);
      const pathname = url.pathname;
      const basename = <PLACEHOLDER>(pathname);
      const decodedBasename = decodeURIComponent(basename);

      options.dest = path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename);
    }
  }

  if (!path.isAbsolute(options.dest)) {
    options.dest = path.resolve(__dirname, options.dest);
  }

  return request(options);
};

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
path.basename
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
