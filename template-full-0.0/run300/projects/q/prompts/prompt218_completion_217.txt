  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with a new error object, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `null`, whereas `reject` would cause it to be rejected.

DONE.
