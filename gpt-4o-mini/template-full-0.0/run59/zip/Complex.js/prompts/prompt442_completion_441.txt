Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number, which would change the scaling factor used in the rounding operation, potentially leading to incorrect rounding results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which would not scale the number for rounding but instead just return the absolute value, leading to incorrect results when rounding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, which would not provide the intended precision for rounding to a specified number of decimal places, resulting in a loss of accuracy in the rounded complex number.

DONE.
