  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(precision++).toFixed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator would increment the `precision` variable before calling the `toFixed` method, which would result in a different number of decimal places being rounded to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(precision+1).toFixed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+1` operator would add 1 to the `precision` variable before calling the `toFixed` method, which would result in a different number of decimal places being rounded to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(precision*10).toFixed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*10` operator would multiply the `precision` variable by 10 before calling the `toFixed` method, which would result in a different number of decimal places being rounded to.

DONE.
