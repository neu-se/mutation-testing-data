  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `abort` and `onAbort`, while the new code fragment `null` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `abort` and `onAbort`, while the new code fragment `undefined` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `abort` and `onAbort`, while the new code fragment `0` is a number and will not be called.

DONE.
