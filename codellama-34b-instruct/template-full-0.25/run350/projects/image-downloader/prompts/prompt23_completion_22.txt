  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` returns the name of the current module, while `__dirname` returns the directory name of the current module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory, while `__dirname` returns the directory name of the current module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(module.filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(module.filename)` returns the directory name of the current module, while `__dirname` returns the directory name of the current module.

DONE.
