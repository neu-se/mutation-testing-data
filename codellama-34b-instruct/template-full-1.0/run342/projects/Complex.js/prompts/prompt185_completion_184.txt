  Sure, I can help you with that.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is the square root function in JavaScript, which takes a single number as its argument, whereas `Math.pow` is the power function that takes two arguments, the base and the exponent. Replacing `Math.pow` with `Math.sqrt` would cause the code to calculate the square root of the base instead of raising it to the power of the exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is the absolute value function in JavaScript, which takes a single number as its argument, whereas `Math.pow` takes two arguments, the base and the exponent. Replacing `Math.pow` with `Math.abs` would cause the code to calculate the absolute value of the base instead of raising it to the power of the exponent.
