  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now set to `true`, which would cause the `once` function to be called with `true` as its argument, which would in turn call the `onEnd` function with `null` as its argument. This would result in the stream ending prematurely, which could cause issues if the stream is being used in a context where it is expected to continue running.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now set to `false`, which would cause the `once` function to not be called at all. This would result in the stream not ending prematurely, which could cause issues if the stream is being used in a context where it is expected to end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now set to `null
