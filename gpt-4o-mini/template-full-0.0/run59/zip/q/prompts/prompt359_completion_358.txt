Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress callback to receive `undefined` instead of the actual value, potentially leading to incorrect handling of progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value being passed to the progress callback, changing its type or value and potentially leading to unexpected results in the handling of progress updates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the progress callback instead of the actual value, which could lead to incorrect assumptions or errors in the logic that processes the progress notifications.

DONE.
