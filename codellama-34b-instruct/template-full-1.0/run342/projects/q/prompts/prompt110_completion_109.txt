  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now for inequality instead of equality, which could lead to the code failing to find the value in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i+1] === value
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now for the value in the next index of the array, which could lead to the code returning the wrong index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] = value
```
This would result in different behavior because the value in the array is now being overwritten with a new value, which could lead to the code returning index 0 for a non-existent value.

DONE.
