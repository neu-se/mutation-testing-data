 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is used to parse JSON strings, not to match regular expressions. It would likely throw a syntax error or return an unexpected result when passed the `tokens` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` executes a string as JavaScript code. It would likely execute arbitrary code, potentially causing security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
document.querySelector
```
This would result in different behavior because `document.querySelector` is used to select elements from a DOM tree. It would likely return `null` or throw an error when passed the `tokens` variable, which is not a DOM element.

DONE.
