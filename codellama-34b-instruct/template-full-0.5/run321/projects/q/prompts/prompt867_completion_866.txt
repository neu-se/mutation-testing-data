  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)` instead of `deferred.reject(value)`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))` instead of `deferred.reject(reason)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(reason)` instead of `deferred.resolve(value)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
