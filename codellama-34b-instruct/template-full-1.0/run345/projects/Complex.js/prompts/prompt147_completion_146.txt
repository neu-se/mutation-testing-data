  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the undefined behavior when the imaginary part of the number is not 1, whereas the original code would have returned a value without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the undefined behavior when the imaginary part of the number is 0, whereas the original code would have returned a value without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the undefined behavior for any value of the imaginary part, whereas the original code would have returned a value without throwing an error only when the imaginary part is 0.

DONE.
