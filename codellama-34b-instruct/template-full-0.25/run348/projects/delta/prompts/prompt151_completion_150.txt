  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add `firstLeft` to `firstOther.retain`, regardless of whether `firstLeft` is greater than `firstOther.retain` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always multiply `firstOther.retain` by `firstLeft`, regardless of whether `firstLeft` is greater than `firstOther.retain` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain / firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always divide `firstOther.retain` by `firstLeft`, regardless of whether `firstLeft` is greater than `firstOther.retain` or not.

DONE.
