  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then
```
This would result in different behavior because then() is a function that returns a promise for the completion of a promise, which is different from Q, which is a function that returns a promise for a value.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.always
```
This would result in different behavior because always() is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled with a value or rejected with an error, while Q always returns a promise for a value.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.never
```
This would result in different behavior because never() is a function that returns a promise that is never fulfilled or rejected, while Q always returns a promise for a value.

DONE.
