  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('different error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test would fail if it is not expecting this specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('different message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the message logged to the console would be different, and the test would fail if it is not expecting this specific message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 'different return value'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, and the test would fail if it is not expecting this specific return value.

DONE.
