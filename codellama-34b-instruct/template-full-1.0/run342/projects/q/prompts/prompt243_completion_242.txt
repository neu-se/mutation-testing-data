  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is initially set to `undefined`, and only changes to a non-`undefined` value after the promise has been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is only initialized to an empty array if the promise has not yet been resolved. Once the promise is resolved, `messages` is set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longStackSupport === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackSupport` is a boolean flag that controls whether or not long stack traces are enabled. If `longStackSupport` is `true`, the promise will include a stack trace in its error message, which can be useful for debugging purposes.

DONE.
