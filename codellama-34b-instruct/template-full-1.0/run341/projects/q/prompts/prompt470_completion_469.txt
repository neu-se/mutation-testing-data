  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 5 instead of the actual value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null instead of the actual value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the promise plus 1 instead of the actual value of the promise.

DONE.
