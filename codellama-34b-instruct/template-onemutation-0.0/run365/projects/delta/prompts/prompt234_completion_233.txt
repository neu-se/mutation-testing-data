  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the delta's internal state. `insert` inserts a new operation at the current position in the delta, while `push` appends a new operation to the end of the delta. In this particular code snippet, `push` is used to append a new operation to the end of the delta, so replacing it with `insert` would cause the new operation to be inserted at the beginning of the delta instead.
