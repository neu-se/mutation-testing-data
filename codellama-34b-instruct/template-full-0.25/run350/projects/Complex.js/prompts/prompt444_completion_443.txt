  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 if places is falsy, whereas the original code would return 0 in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 if places is truthy, whereas the original code would return places if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 if places is 0, whereas the original code would return 0 if places is falsy.

DONE.
