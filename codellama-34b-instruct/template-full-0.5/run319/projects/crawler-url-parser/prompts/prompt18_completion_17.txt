  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the base URL string to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues with the `URL.parse()` method if it is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + "example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the base URL string with the string "example.com", which could potentially cause issues with the `URL.parse()` method if it is not expecting a domain name to be present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the base URL string on the "/" character, and the `[0]` index would select the first element of the resulting array, which could potentially cause issues with the `URL.parse()` method if it is expecting a
