  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a Promise that is resolved when all the promises in the array have been resolved. In contrast, `defer()` returns a deferred object that can be used to construct a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise with no value. In contrast, `defer()` returns a deferred object that can be used to construct a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise. In contrast, `defer()` returns a deferred object that can be used to construct a promise.

DONE.
