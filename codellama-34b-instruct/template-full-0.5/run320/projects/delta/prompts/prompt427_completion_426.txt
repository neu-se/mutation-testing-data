  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is of type `number`, while this replacement checks if it is not of type `number`. This change would cause the function to return a different value if `op.retain` is not a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if it is not equal to 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value if `op.retain` is not 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
