  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses at the end of `this['isInfinite']()` would cause the function to be called, which would cause the function to return `true` or `false` instead of the actual complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for equality, but the `!==` operator checks for inequality. This would cause the function to return `false` even if the complex number is the same as `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` stands for "Not a Number", and it is used to represent the result of a calculation that is undefined or cannot be represented as a number. In this case, the function would return `true` if the complex number is not
