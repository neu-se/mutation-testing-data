  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 90 degrees to the latitude coordinate, which would change the resulting distance and bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 90 degrees from the latitude coordinate, which would also change the resulting distance and bearing calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(deg2rad + 90) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 90 degrees to the latitude coordinate, and then take the result modulo 360, which would wrap the value around the 0-360 degree range and cause the bearing calculation to be off by a multiple of 360 degrees.

DONE.
