  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the number is infinite, while `isFinite` is a method that checks if the number is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a method that checks if the number is not a number, while `isFinite` is a method that checks if the number is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a property that represents the imaginary part of the number, while `isFinite` is a method that checks if the number is finite.

DONE.
