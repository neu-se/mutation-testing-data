Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("No promises provided"));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving with a fulfilled promise when the input array is empty, it would reject with an error, changing the expected outcome of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving with an undefined value when there are no promises, it would resolve with `null`, which could lead to confusion in the handling of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly resolve with `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior of returning a promise that resolves to the first fulfilled promise, potentially leading to different handling in the calling code.

DONE.
