  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[0]` is not a function, so it will not be called and the code inside the function will not be executed, which changes the behavior of the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.length` is a number, not a function, so it will not be called and the code inside the function will not be executed, which changes the behavior of the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length - 1]` is not the same as `ref[0]`, so it will not be called and the code inside the function will not be executed, which changes the behavior of the application.

DONE.
