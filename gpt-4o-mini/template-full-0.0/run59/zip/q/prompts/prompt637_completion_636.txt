Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "remove" does not correspond to a valid operation for deleting a property, which would lead to the property not being deleted as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because using "undefined" as the operation name would not trigger the delete operation, and instead, it may lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to delete a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because using "set" instead of "delete" would attempt to set a property rather than delete it, leading to the opposite effect of what the original code intended.

DONE.
