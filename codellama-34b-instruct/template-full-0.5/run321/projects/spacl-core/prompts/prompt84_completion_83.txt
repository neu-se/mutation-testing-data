  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce((acc, rule) => acc.concat(rule.clone()), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce()` returns a single value, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

DONE.
