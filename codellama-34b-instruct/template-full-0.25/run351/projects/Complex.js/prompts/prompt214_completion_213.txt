  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to always return the same value, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to always return a value that is one greater than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to always return a value that is the sum of the original values.

DONE.
