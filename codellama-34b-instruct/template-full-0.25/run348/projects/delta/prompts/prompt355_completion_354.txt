  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if the argument is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if the argument is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while this replacement checks if the argument is not equal to zero.

DONE.
