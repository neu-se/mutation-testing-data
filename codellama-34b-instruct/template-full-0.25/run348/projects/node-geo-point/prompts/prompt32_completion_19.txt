  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude + point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the two longitude values, which is not the same as the original code that calculates the difference between the two longitude values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude - point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference between the two longitude values, but it would do so in the opposite direction as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude * point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of the two longitude values, which is not the same as the original code that calculates the difference between the two longitude values.

DONE.
