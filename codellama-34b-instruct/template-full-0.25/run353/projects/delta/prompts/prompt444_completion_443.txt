  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `offset` and `length` variables, while this replacement uses the sum of `offset` and `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `offset` and `length` variables, while this replacement uses the difference of `offset` and `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `offset` and `length` variables, while this replacement uses the difference of `length` and `offset`.

DONE.
