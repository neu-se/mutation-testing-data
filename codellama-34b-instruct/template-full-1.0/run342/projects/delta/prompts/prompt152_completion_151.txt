  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, if any, or `null` if there are no more operations. In this case, if the next operation in `thisIter` is not a delete, the loop will continue even if `otherIter` has no more operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, if any, or `null` if there are no more operations. In this case, if the next operation in `otherIter` is not an insert, the loop will continue even if `thisIter` has no more operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext() && !otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different
