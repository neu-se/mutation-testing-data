  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means it would not return a promise and would not be able to handle asynchronous errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile.bind(null)` would create a new function that is bound to the `null` context, which means it would not have access to the `this` context of the original `_writeFile` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the original `_writeFile` function, which means it would have access to the same `this` context as the original function.

DONE.
