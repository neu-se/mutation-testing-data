  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of a number raised to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a function that returns the sine of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of a number raised to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a function that returns the cosine of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of a number raised to a power.

DONE.
