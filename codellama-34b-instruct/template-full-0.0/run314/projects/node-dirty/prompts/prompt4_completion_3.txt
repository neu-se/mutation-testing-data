  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` removes a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with `undefined` as the value would overwrite the existing value with `undefined`, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with `null` as the value would overwrite the existing value with `null`, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair entirely.

DONE.
