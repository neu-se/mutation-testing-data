  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude !== 'string' || typeof longitude !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` arguments are numbers, while this new code fragment checks if they are strings. If the arguments are not strings, the original code fragment would throw an error, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude !== 'undefined' || typeof longitude !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` arguments are numbers, while this new code fragment checks if they are undefined. If the arguments are undefined, the original code fragment would throw an error, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude !== 'function' || typeof longitude !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `
