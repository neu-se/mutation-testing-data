  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.bind(object)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code because it uses the `bind` method to bind the `inspect` method to the `object` argument, which is not necessary and can cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.call(object)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code because it uses the `call` method to call the `inspect` method on the `object` argument, which is not necessary and can cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.apply(object)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code because it uses the `apply` method to apply the `inspect` method on the `object` argument, which is not necessary and can cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
