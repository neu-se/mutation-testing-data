  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `nextOp` to be an object with an `insert` property, but `null` does not have any properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `nextOp` to be an object with an `insert` property, but `undefined` does not have any properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `nextOp` to be an object with an `insert` property, but an empty object `{}` does not have any properties.

DONE.
