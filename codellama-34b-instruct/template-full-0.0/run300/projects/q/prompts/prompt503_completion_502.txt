  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this context, `void 0` is used to indicate that the `this` value should be undefined, whereas `null` would be a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this context, `void 0` is used to indicate that the `this` value should be undefined, whereas `undefined` would be a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a reference to the current object, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In this context, `
