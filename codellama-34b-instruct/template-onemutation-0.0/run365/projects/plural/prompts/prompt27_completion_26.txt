  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while the new code fragment subtracts 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "nucleus" to be incorrect.

DONE.
