  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream's buffer is empty, but the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when there is an error in the write stream, but the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, but the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed and all in-flight writes have completed.

DONE.
