  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the `other` iterator is 'insert', but this replacement code fragment checks if the next operation is 'retain'. This change would cause the method to erroneously identify a 'retain' operation as 'insert' and execute the code inside the 'insert' branch, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof otherOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `otherOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code fragment checks if it is any other type. This change would cause the method to incorrectly identify an operation with a non-numeric `retain` property as 'insert' and execute the code inside the 'insert' branch, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i > delta.
