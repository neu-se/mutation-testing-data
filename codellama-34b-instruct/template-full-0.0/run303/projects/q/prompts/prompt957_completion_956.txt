  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a function that returns a promise that resolves after a specified delay, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object that can be used to create a promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves immediately.

DONE.
