  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the op.retain object is not an op and does not have the same attributes as an op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op.retain object is not the same as the number of characters in the op.retain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the attribute map of the op.retain object is not the same as the attribute map of the op.insert object.

DONE.
