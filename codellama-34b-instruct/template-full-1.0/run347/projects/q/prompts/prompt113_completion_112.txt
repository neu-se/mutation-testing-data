  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method binds the `this` keyword to the first argument, while the `apply` method does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function with the `this` keyword bound to the first argument, while the `call` method invokes the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses operator `()` invokes the function immediately, while `call` and `apply` only bind the `this` keyword and do not invoke the function.

DONE.
