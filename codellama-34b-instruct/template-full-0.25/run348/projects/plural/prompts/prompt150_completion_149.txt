  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.plural(num)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function is not defined as a method of the `String` object in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num.plural(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function is not defined as a method of the `Number` object in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
