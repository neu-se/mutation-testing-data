  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator `%` now returns `0` instead of `1` for even values of `minus`, which would cause the code to subtract `1` instead of add it in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` is now replaced with a `0`, which would cause the code to always add `0` instead of `1` in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` is now replaced with a `2`, which would cause the code to always add `2` instead of `1` in some cases.

DONE.
