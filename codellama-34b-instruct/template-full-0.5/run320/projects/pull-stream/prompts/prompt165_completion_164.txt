  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call, while `true` is a boolean value. The function call would be executed and potentially have side effects, while `true` would simply evaluate to a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call, while `false` is a boolean value. The function call would be executed and potentially have side effects, while `false` would simply evaluate to a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call, while `null` is a null value. The function call would be executed and potentially have side effects, while `null` would simply evaluate to a null value.

DONE.
