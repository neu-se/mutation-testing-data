  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would match a string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment would not match a string that ends with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!\/)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would match a string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment would not match a string that ends with a slash and has a slash before the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!\/.*$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would match a string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment would not match a string that ends with a slash and has any number of slashes before the end of the string.

DONE.
