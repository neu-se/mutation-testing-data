  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 170) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude is shifted by 10 degrees, which can change the tile number in the X direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude * 360) / Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude is multiplied by 360, which can change the tile number in the X direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude / 360) * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude is divided by 360, which can change the tile number in the X direction.

DONE.
