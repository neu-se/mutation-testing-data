Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to be called with `null` instead of the actual promise, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially causing the promise to be resolved immediately with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `when` function instead of the promise, which may lead to the promise being resolved immediately with `undefined`, thus bypassing the intended promise resolution logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not_a_promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of a promise would cause the `when` function to treat it as a non-promise value, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the promise's fulfillment or rejection states.

DONE.
