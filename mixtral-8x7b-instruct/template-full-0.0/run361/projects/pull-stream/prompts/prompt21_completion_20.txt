 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly access the second argument instead of using the `read` function, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the argument is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pull.apply(null, ref.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `pull` function to the `ref` array starting from the second element, instead of using the `read` function as the first argument. This could lead to unexpected results or errors if the arguments are not in the expected format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the last argument instead of the `read` function as the second argument. This could lead to unexpected results or errors if the arguments are not in the expected format.

DONE.
