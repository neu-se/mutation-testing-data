  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is pushing a different argument to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not passing any arguments to the `makeNodeResolver` method, while this option is passing `null` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not passing any arguments to the `makeNodeResolver` method, while this option is passing `deferred.promise` as an argument.

DONE.
