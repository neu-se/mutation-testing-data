 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[data, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to the callback function, which could cause issues if the code downstream expects the error to be the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes one argument to the callback function, which could cause issues if the code downstream expects two arguments (error and data).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the data argument to undefined, which could cause issues if the code downstream checks for the existence or value of the data argument.

DONE.
