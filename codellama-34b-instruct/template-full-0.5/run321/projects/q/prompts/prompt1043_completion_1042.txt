  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get()` method to return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object instead of the `head` property, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get()` method to return the `tail` property of the `head` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ends.promise.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get()` method to return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
