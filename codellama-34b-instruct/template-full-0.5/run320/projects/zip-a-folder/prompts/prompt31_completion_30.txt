  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is a different method than `output.on`, and it would not trigger the same event handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.emit` is a different method than `output.on`, and it would not trigger the same event handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.once` is a different method than `output.on`, and it would not trigger the same event handler.

DONE.
