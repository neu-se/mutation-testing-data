  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points using the latitude of the second point instead of the first point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points using the sum of the latitudes of the two points instead of the difference between them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(point1Rad - point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points using the absolute value of the difference between the latitudes of the two points instead of the difference between them.

DONE.
