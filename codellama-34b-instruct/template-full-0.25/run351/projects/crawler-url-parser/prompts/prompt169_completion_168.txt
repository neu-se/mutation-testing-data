```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the path, but the new code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the first part of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to
