 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now appends 'es' instead of replacing the last two characters with 'es', resulting in incorrect plurals for words like 'thesis' and 'crisis'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thesis|crisis/g, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'g' flag makes the regular expression search global, causing it to fail since the function expects a single word as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thesis|critic/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
