  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or until `i` becomes negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to run twice as fast.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset `i` to 0 instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or until `i` becomes negative.

DONE.
