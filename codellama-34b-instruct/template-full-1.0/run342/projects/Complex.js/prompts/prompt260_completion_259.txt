  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `a` variable, which is used in the `logHypot` function. The `logHypot` function is used to compute the magnitude of the complex number, and changing the value of `a` would give a different magnitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `b` variable, which is used in the `logHypot` function. The `logHypot` function is used to compute the magnitude of the complex number, and changing the value of `b` would give a different magnitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the computation of the `logHypot` function. The `logHypot` function is used to compute the magnitude of the complex number, and
