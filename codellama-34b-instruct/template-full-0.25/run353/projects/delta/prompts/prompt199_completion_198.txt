  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest` is a string, and `slice(1)` would return a substring starting from the second character, which would be different from the original code that used `thisIter.rest` as-is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest` is a string, and `slice(1)` would return a substring starting from the second character, which would be different from the original code that used `otherIter.rest` as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest` is a string, and `split('').reverse().join('')` would return a reversed version of the string, which would be different from the original code
