  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the value of `a` would change the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the value of `a` would change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a` by 2 would change the result of the expression.

DONE.
