 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the returned promise to the current promise object, instead of the original `object` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of the `object` argument to the `nodeify` function, which could cause unexpected behavior in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `object` argument with an empty function, which would cause the `nodeify` function to fail when trying to access the `then` method.

DONE.
