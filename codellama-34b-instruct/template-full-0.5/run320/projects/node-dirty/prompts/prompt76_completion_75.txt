  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the file does not exist, while the new code fragment returns 1, indicating that the file does exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the file does not exist, while the new code fragment returns -1, indicating that the file does exist but there was an error reading it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the file does not exist, while the new code fragment returns Infinity, indicating that the file does exist and there was an error reading it.

DONE.
