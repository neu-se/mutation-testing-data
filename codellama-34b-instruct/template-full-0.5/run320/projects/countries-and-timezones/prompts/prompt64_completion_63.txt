  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `deliverCountry` is not being called, which means that the `country` object is not being transformed by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter is not being passed to the `deliverCountry` function, which means that the function may not behave as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter is not being passed to the `deliverCountry` function, which means that the function may not behave as expected.

DONE.
