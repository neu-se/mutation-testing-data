  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to a variable. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on the value of the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the undefined value. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on how the undefined value is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the null value. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on how the null value is handled.

DONE.
