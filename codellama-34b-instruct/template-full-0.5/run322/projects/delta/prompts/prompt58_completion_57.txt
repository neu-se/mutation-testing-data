  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, causing the `if` statement to be executed even if `ops` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `if` statement to be executed regardless of the value of `ops`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an instance of the `Array` class, which may not always be the case.

DONE.
