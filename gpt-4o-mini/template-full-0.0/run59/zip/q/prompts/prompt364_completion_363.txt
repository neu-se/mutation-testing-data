Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with `undefined` instead of the actual fulfilled value, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent promise chains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with `null`, which is a distinct value from the original fulfilled value, and could cause issues if the subsequent logic relies on the actual fulfilled value being passed through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with the string `"error"` instead of the actual fulfilled value, which could mislead the consumer of the promise into thinking an error occurred when it did not.

DONE.
