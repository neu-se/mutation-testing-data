  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = allResolved;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allResolved` is a function that takes an array of promises as input, while `allResolved` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = function () {
    return Q.all(arguments);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allResolved` is a function that takes an array of promises as input, while the above code snippet defines a function that takes no arguments and returns a promise that resolves to an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = function (promises) {
    return Q.all(promises).then(function (results) {
        return results.map(function (result) {
            return result.state;
        });
    });
};
```
