  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality instead of checking if the two values are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality instead of checking if the two values are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert == otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for loose equality instead of checking if the two values are equal.

DONE.
