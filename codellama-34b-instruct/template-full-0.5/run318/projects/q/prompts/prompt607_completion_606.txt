  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `op`, which would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `op`, which would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `op`, which would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
