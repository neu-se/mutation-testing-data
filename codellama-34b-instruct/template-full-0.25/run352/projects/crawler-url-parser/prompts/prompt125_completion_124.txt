  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the type of `linkurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `linkurl` is equal to the string "string".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `linkurl` has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.includes("string")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `linkurl` includes the string "string".

DONE.
