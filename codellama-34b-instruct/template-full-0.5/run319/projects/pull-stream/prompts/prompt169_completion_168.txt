  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with the incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with the arguments in the wrong order.

DONE.
