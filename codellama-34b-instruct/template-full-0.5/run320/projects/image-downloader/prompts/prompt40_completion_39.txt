  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, flag: 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` option is set to `'a'`, which means the file will be appended to instead of overwritten.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, mode: 0o644 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is set to `0o644`, which means the file will be created with read and write permissions for the owner, and read permissions for the group and others.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, start: 100 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` option is set to `100`, which means the file will be written starting at byte 100 instead of the beginning.

DONE.
