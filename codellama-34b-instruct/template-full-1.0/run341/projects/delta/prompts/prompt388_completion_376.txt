  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length += thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the length of the deleted content to the `length` variable, rather than the length of the retained content as in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length - thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the deleted content from the `offset` variable, rather than the length of the retained content as in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
transformedData = length - thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the difference between the length of the retained content and the length of the deleted content to the `transformedData` variable, rather than the length of the retained content as in the original code fragment.

DONE.
