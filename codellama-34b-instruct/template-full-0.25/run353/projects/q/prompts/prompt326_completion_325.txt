  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op + 1` would result in a string concatenation, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op.toUpperCase()` would result in a string with all characters in uppercase, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op.length` would result in the length of the string, which would not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
