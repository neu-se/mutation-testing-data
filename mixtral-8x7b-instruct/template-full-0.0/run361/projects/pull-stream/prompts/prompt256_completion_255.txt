 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call `nextStream()` instead of checking the `end` parameter, causing the function to continue processing even after the stream has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable directly, potentially causing issues if `stream` is not a function or an object. The original code checks if `stream` is a function and converts it to a once function if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values(stream) || once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always convert `stream` to a once function, even if it is already an object. The original code only converts `stream` to a once function if it is not a function or an object.

DONE.
