  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("This is a buggy implementation of Q");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original implementation of Q is a function that returns a promise, while this buggy implementation throws an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "This is a buggy implementation of Q";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original implementation of Q is a function that returns a promise, while this buggy implementation returns a string instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return new Error("This is a buggy implementation of Q");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original implementation of Q is a function that returns a promise, while this buggy implementation returns an error object instead.

DONE.
