  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(promise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop where the promise dispatches itself, causing the code to become stuck in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with an undefined value, which might cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with itself, which could cause issues if the code that uses the promise expects a different resolution value.

DONE.
