  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function always returns null, regardless of the promise's fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function always throws an error, regardless of the promise's fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function always returns a rejected promise, regardless of the promise's fulfillment value.

DONE.
