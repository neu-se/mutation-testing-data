  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `resolvedPromise` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is defined on the `promise` object, not on the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.promiseDispatch.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is defined on the `promise` object, not on the `resolvedPromise` object, and the `inspect` method is not defined on the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
