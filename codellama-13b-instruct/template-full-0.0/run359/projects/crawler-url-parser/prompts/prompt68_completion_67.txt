  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the same arguments as the original code, which would result in the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr + "test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` argument is modified, which would affect the behavior of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr + "test", baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrlStr` argument is modified, which would affect the behavior of the `parse` function.

DONE.
