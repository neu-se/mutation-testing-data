  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q".delay(object, timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is not defined on the `"Q"` string and will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.delay(timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is not defined on the `object` and will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.delay(timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is defined on the `Promise.prototype` but the code expects it to be a function on the `object`.

DONE.
