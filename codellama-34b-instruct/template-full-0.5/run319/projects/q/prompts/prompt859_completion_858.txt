  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` rejects the promise, while `deferred.resolve` resolves it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("test")` throws an error, while `deferred.reject` rejects the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` notifies the promise, while `deferred.reject` rejects it.

DONE.
