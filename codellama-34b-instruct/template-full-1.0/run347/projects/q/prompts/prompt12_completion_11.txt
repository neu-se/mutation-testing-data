  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(typeof ses === "undefined")
```
This would result in the `ses.makeQ` line being executed, as the `!` operator would invert the result of the `typeof ses === "undefined"` expression, causing the condition to evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "object"
```
This would result in the `ses.makeQ` line not being executed, as the `typeof ses` expression would be evaluated to "string", which would not match the value "object".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in an irrelevant behavior change, as the `typeof ses` expression would evaluate to "undefined", which means the condition would never be true and the `ses.makeQ` line would not be executed.

DONE.
