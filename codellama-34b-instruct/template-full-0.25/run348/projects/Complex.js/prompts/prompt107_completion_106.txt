  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Complex object, while this code returns the NaN constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Complex object, while this code returns the Infinity constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Complex object with the correct real and imaginary parts, while this code returns a new Complex object with both parts equal to zero.

DONE.
