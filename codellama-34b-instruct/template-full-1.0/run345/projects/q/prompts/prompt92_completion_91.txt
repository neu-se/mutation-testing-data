  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer check for the correct number of arguments, leading to potential null pointer exceptions or other errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arguments === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `arguments` object is of type "object", which it is, but it would not check if it has the correct number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the number of arguments is not equal to 1, which would always return true, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
