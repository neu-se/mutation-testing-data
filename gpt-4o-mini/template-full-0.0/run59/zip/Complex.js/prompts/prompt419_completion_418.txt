Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is infinite instead of zero, potentially leading to incorrect handling of cases where the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a boolean value instead of relying on the method's intended functionality, which could lead to unexpected results when checking if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is zero instead of checking the entire complex number, which may incorrectly allow non-zero imaginary parts to pass as zero.

DONE.
