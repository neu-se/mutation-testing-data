  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `b` instead of `a` in the calculation of `sinh(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `a` in the calculation of `cos(a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by `b` instead of using `a` and `b` separately in the calculations of `cos(a)` and `sinh(b)`.

DONE.
