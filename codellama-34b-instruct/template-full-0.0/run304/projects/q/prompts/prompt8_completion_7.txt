  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = definition(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export a null value instead of the expected function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = definition(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export an undefined value instead of the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = definition(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export a function that returns undefined instead of the expected function.

DONE.
