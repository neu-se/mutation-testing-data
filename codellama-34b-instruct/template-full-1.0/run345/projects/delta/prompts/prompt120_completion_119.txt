  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the `delete` property of the `elem` object, which would affect the behavior of the `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the `delete` property of the `elem` object by 2, which would affect the behavior of the `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing the `delete` property of the `elem` object by 2, which would affect the behavior of the `reduce` method.

DONE.
