Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delay from 0 milliseconds to 1000 milliseconds, causing the `flush` function to be executed after a longer wait, potentially leading to delayed task execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because a negative timeout is not valid; it may cause the `flush` function to be executed immediately or not at all, depending on the JavaScript engine's handling of negative timeouts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() { flush(); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `flush` call in an anonymous function, which introduces an additional layer of function call, potentially affecting the execution context and timing of the `flush` function.

DONE.
