  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will return the entire string if no arguments are provided, whereas `split` with no arguments will return an array of each character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` will return a substring starting at the specified index until the end of the string, whereas `split` with no arguments will return an array of each character in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `trim` will remove whitespace from both ends of the string, whereas `split` with no arguments will not modify the string.

DONE.
