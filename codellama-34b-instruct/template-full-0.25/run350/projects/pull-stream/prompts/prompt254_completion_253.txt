  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the `err` variable to be strictly equal to `true`, while this replacement checks for it to be truthy. This could cause the `nextStream()` function to be called when it should not be, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
