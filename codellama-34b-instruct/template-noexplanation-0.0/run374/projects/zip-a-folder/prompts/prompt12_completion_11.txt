  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the `fs.constants.W_OK` flag to the `access` method, which checks for write permission in addition to read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to combine the `fs.constants.R_OK` and `fs.constants.W_OK` flags. This means that the `access` method will only succeed if both read and write permissions are granted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants
