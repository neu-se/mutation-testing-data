Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from multiplication to division, which would yield a completely different result for the rounding operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part (`this['im']`) instead of the real part (`this['re']`), which would affect the rounding of the complex number in an unexpected way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(this['re'] * places)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the rounding method from rounding to the nearest integer to always rounding down, which could lead to a loss of precision in the result.

DONE.
