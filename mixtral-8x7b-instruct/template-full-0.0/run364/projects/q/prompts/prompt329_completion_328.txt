 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Replacement error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object instead of calling the `reject` function, which may have specific behavior or side-effects in the rest of the codebase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject('Replacement error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a rejected Promise instead of calling the `reject` function. This might affect how errors are handled in the rest of the codebase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('Replacement error')
