  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'persons')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "person" with a new one that has a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "person" with a new one that has a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'people')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "person" with a new one that has a different plural form.

DONE.
