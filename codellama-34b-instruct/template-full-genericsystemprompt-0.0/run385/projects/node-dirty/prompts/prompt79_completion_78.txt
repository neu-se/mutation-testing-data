  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'drain'` is not emitted when the `Dirty` object is instantiated, whereas the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'close'` is not emitted when the `Dirty` object is instantiated, whereas the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'load'` is emitted when the `Dirty` object is instantiated, whereas the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs.

DONE.
