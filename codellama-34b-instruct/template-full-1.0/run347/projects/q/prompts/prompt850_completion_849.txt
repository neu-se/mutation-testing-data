  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timer.onTimeout = () => deferred.reject(new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code specifies that `error` should be an Error object or a string, while the new code fragment does not have this restriction, potentially causing errors from invalid input.  
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error || error.message === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `error` is undefined or if it has a `string` property, while the new code fragment only checks if `error` is truthy.  
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.code === "ETIMEDOUT"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `error` is an instance of `Error` by checking if the property `code` is equal to `ETIMEDOUT`, while the new code fragment would only check the `
