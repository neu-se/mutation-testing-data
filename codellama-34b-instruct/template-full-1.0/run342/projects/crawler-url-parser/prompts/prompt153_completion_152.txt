  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(0, -1).replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the `linkurl_path` before applying the `replace` method, which may change the outcome of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace("^/(.*)/$", "$1")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first and last slashes in the `linkurl_path` with nothing, which may change the outcome of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last occurrence of a slash followed by non-slash characters from the `linkurl_path`, which may change the outcome of the method.

DONE.
