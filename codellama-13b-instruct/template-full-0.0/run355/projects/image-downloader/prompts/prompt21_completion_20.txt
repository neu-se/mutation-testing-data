  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `options.dest` string to uppercase, which could cause issues if the original code was relying on the case of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `options.dest` string to lowercase, which could cause issues if the original code was relying on the case of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/[a-z]/g, 'X')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all lowercase letters in the `options.dest` string with the character 'X', which could cause issues if the original code was relying on the case of the string.

DONE.
