  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `threw` variable, causing the code to always return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check if the `threw` variable is strictly equal to the boolean value `true`, causing the code to always return a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected one.

DONE.
