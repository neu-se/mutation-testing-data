 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function call to an arrow function, which might affect the context (`this`) or cause issues with closures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the UTC offset instead of the DST offset, which could lead to incorrect timezone information being displayed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(Math.abs(dstOffset))
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive offset, removing the distinction between positive and negative offsets. This could lead to incorrect timezone information being displayed.

DONE.
