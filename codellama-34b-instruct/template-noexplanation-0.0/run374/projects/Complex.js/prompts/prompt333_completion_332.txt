  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -2
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-2`, which is different from the original code where the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== -1
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is not equal to `-1`, which is different from the original code where the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `1`, which is different from the original code where the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to `-1`.
