Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the sine of the latitude instead of converting the latitude from degrees to radians, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the distance formula.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 90 to the latitude value, which would distort the actual latitude and lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the latitude of `point1` instead of `point2`, which would yield an incorrect distance calculation between the two points.

DONE.
