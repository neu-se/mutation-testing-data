  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `psl.parse` function returns an object with the domain and subdomain of the host, whereas the original code fragment returns the host as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `psl.parse` function returns an object with the domain and subdomain of the host, whereas the original code fragment returns the host as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `psl.parse` function returns an object with the domain and subdomain of the host, whereas the original code fragment returns the host as a string.

DONE.
