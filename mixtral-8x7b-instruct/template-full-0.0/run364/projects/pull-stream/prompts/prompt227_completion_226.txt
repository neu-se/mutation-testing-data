 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values instead of testing the truthiness of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => !data.isValid
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `isValid` property of the data object instead of testing the truthiness of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data is an empty array instead of testing the truthiness of the data.

These changes would result in different behavior and potentially expose weaknesses in the test suite, as they introduce new conditions that might not be covered by the existing tests. DONE.
