  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, as `b[key]` would always be equal to `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return a non-empty object, as `a[key] + 1` would never be equal to `b[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return a non-empty object, as `a[key] * 2` would never be equal to `b[key]`.

DONE.
