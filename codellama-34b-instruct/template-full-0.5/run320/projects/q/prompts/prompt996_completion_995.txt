  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(){}` is a different function than `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, and it would not have the same side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error){throw error;}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(error){throw error;}` would throw an error if one is passed to it, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error){console.log(error);}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(error){console.log(error);}` would log an error to the console if one is passed to it, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would not log anything.

DONE.
