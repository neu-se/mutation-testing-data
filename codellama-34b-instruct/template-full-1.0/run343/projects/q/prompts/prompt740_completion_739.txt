  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would defer the current promise, allowing other tasks to run before it continues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the current promise by a fixed amount of time, allowing the test suite to continue processing other tasks before it is resumed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the current promise, causing the test suite to skip over any tasks that depend on it.

DONE.
