 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with the arguments provided to the defer function, while this modification would always call the callback with the argument `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function(){}
