  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[ref.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the last element of the `ref` array instead of the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.random() * ref.length | 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a random element of the `ref` array instead of the first element.

DONE.
