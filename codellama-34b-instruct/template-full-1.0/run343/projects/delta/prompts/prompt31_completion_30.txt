  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` is a function that creates a new array from an iterable object, whereas `Object.keys` is a function that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `_.keys` is a function that returns the names of an object's own enumerable properties, whereas `Object.keys` does the same thing but is a standard JavaScript method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

DONE.
