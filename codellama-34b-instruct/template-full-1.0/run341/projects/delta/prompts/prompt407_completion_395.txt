  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(handler);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the `handler` function to the console, whereas the original code fragment would call the `handler` function with the arguments provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of adding 1 to the `handler` function, whereas the original code fragment would call the `handler` function with the arguments provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `handler` function with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment would call the `handler` function with the arguments provided.

DONE.
