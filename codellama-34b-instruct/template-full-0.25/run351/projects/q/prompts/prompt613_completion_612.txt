  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to `undefined` instead of getting its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the property instead of getting its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would post an empty array as the property value instead of getting its value.

DONE.
