 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally wraps the input promise with `Q.when()`, which may cause unexpected behavior if the input is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a new promise that is resolved to the input promise, which may cause unexpected behavior if the input is already a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise || Q.when(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a wrapped promise with `Q.when()` when the input is falsy, which may cause unexpected behavior if the input is intentionally falsy.

DONE.
