  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `this` binding, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `this` binding, but it is not the same as `value`, which is the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value for the `this` binding, but it is not the same as `value`, which is the expected value.

DONE.
