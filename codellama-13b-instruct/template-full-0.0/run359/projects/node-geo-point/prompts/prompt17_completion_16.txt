  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `coordinates` array instead of the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the `coordinates` array instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the `coordinates` array instead of the entire array.

DONE.
