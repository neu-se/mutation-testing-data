  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `get` is not defined for arrays, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of an array is retrieved using the `length` property, not the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects a string or a number as the property name, while the value `1` is neither string nor number. It would throw an error.

DONE.
