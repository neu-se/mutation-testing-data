  Answer:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the URL, causing the `URL.parse()` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http+:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an invalid protocol to the URL, causing the `URL.parse()` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a domain name to the URL, causing the `URL.parse()` method to fail.

DONE.
