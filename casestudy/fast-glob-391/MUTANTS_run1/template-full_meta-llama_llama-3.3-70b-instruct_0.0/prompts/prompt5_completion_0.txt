Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(negative, this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not set the `dot` option to `true` for negative patterns, potentially changing the matching behavior for dot files and directories.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(positive, {...this._micromatchOptions, dot: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the positive patterns instead of the negative patterns, and also set the `dot` option to `true`, potentially changing the matching behavior for dot files and directories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => negative
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not convert the negative patterns to regular expressions at all, instead returning the original patterns, which would likely cause errors or incorrect behavior when trying to match against them.

DONE.
