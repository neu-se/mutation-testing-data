  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<"reject">
```
This would result in different behavior because "reject" is a reserved keyword in Q and is used to indicate that a promise has been rejected, whereas "throw" is a JavaScript keyword used to indicate that an exception has occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<"catch">
```
This would result in different behavior because "catch" is a reserved keyword in Q and is used to indicate that a promise has been rejected, whereas "throw" is a JavaScript keyword used to indicate that an exception has occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<"settle">
```
This would result in different behavior because "settle" is a reserved keyword in Q and is used to indicate that a promise has been resolved or rejected, whereas "throw" is a JavaScript keyword used to indicate that an exception has occurred.

DONE.
