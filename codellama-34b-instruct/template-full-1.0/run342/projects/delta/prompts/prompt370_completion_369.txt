  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `otherOp.retain` value instead of the `transformedData` value, which could be different depending on the data and the priority.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.retain + transformedData);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `otherOp.retain` value plus the `transformedData` value, which could be different depending on the data and the priority.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` value onto the `delta` array instead of retaining it, which could change the behavior of the `transform` method.

DONE.
