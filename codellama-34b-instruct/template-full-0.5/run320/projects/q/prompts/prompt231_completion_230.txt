  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `pop()` would remove the progress listener, which would cause it to not receive any progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `shift()` would remove the first progress listener, which would cause it to not receive any progress updates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.unshift(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `unshift()`
