  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, { fragment: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the fragment in the URL, while this new code fragment does not. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, { protocol: 'https' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the protocol from the URL, while this new code fragment forces the protocol to be "https". This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, { hostname: 'example.com' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the hostname from the URL, while this new code fragment forces the hostname to be "example.com".
