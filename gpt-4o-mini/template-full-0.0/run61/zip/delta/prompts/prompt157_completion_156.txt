Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to push operations from the `otherIter` when the current operation from `thisIter` is a delete, rather than when the current operation from `otherIter` is an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push operations from `otherIter` whenever the type is anything other than 'insert', potentially leading to incorrect compositions when the expected behavior is to only handle 'insert' types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push operations from `otherIter` when the current operation from `thisIter` is a retain, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations and disrupt the intended composition logic.

DONE.
