  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.eval` is a different method than `policy.query`, and it may have a different implementation that could lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy.query` method is called with a different set of arguments, which could lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy.query` method is called with an additional argument `true` at the end, which could lead to a different result.

DONE.
