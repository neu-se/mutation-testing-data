  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary plus operator will always return the same value, whereas the unary minus operator will return the negative of the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator will always return a different value, whereas the unary minus operator will return the negative of the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '/' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator will always return a different value, whereas the unary minus operator will return the negative of the value.

DONE.
