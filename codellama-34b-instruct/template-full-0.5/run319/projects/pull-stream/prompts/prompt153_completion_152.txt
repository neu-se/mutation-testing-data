  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` is the logical negation of `abort`, which means that the `abortCb` function would be called with `!abort` instead of `abort`, which could lead to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort + 1` would be a different value than `abort`, which could lead to different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort - 1` would be a different value than `abort`, which could lead to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
