  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 180 degrees to the result would cause the latitude to be outside the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but multiplying the result by 2 would cause the latitude to be outside the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but subtracting 180 degrees from the result would cause the latitude to be outside the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees
