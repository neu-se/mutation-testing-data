  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return only non-deprecated timezones, instead of all timezones as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return only deprecated timezones, instead of all timezones as intended.

DONE.
