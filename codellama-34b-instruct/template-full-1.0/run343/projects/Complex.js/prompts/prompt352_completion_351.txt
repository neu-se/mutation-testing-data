  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression will always evaluate to a positive value, whereas the original code fragment may result in a negative value if `a` and `b` have different signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b - a` expression will always evaluate to a negative value, whereas the original code fragment may result in a positive value if `a` and `b` have different signs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) * (a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `(a + b) * (a - b)` expression will always evaluate to a negative value, whereas the original code fragment may result in a positive value if `a` and `b` have different signs.

DONE.
