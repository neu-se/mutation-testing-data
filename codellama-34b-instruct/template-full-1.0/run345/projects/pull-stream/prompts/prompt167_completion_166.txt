  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` parameter is truthy, while the new fragment always evaluates to `null`, which is a falsey value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` parameter is truthy, while the new fragment always evaluates to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` parameter is truthy, while the new fragment checks if it is falsey.

DONE.
