  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the callback is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the callback is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the callback is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is not null.

DONE.
