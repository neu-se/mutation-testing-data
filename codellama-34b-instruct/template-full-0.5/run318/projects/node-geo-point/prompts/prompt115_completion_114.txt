  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value before using it in the calculation, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add pi to the latitude value before using it in the calculation, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
