  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the pathname, while the original code fragment considers the entire pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the pathname, while the original code fragment considers the entire pathname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('\\')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the pathname, while the original code fragment considers the entire pathname.

DONE.
