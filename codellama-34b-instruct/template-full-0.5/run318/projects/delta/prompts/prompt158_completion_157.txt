  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekOp` returns the next operation in the iterator, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` and `otherIter` are different iterators, and `peekOp` would return different operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, which could be different from the type of the operation.

DONE.
