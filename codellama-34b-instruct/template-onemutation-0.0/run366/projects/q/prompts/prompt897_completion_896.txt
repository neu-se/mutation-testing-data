  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` which rejects the promise with the provided error object, while the new code fragment uses `deferred.reject(new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms"))` which rejects the promise with a new error object that is created on the fly. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the specific error message that is being used in the new code fragment.
