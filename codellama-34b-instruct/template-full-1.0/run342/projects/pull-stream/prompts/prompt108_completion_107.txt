  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `cb` is falsy, while this new code fragment is checking whether `acc` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `cb` is falsy, while this new code fragment is checking for strict equality with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof acc === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `cb` is falsy, while this new code fragment is checking whether `acc` is undefined.

DONE.
