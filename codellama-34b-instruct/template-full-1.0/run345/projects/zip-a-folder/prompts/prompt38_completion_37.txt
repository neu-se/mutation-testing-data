  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator would invert the boolean value returned by isGlob, so the glob pattern would be treated as a directory instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFile
```
This would result in different behavior because isFile is a different function that checks whether a given path is a file, not a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because path.basename returns the last portion of a path, whereas isGlob checks whether a string is a glob pattern.

DONE.
