  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would be called with `null` instead of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would be called with `undefined` instead of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would be called with an empty object instead of `data`.

DONE.
