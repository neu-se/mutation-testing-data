  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"goodbye"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "goodbye" would be added to the return value of the `eachLine` method, instead of the expected line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would be added to the return value of the `eachLine` method, instead of the expected line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value would be added to the return value of the `eachLine` method, instead of the expected line number.

DONE.
