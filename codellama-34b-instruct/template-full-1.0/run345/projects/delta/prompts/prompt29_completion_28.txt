  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bae
```
This would result in different behavior because "bae" is a removed variable and would be treated as null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.length
```
This would result in different behavior because "base.length" is a number, not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(base).length
```
This would result in different behavior because "Object.keys(base).length" is a number, not an object.

DONE.
