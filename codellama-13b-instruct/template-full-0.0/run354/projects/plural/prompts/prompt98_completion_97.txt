  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a" in the word "man", and the replacement string "e" would change the word to "men".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a" in the word "man", and the replacement string "i" would change the word to "min".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'o')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a" in the word "man", and the replacement string "o" would change the word to "mon".

DONE.
