  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the elements in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the elements of the copy instead of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method filters out any elements that do not pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the `for...of` loop to skip over any elements that are `undefined`.

DONE.
