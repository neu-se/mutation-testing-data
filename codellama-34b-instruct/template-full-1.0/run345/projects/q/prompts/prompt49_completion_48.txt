  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError('Mock error');
```
This would result in different behavior because a TypeError would be thrown instead of the intended type of Error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return undefined instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Different error message');
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error message would be thrown.

DONE.
