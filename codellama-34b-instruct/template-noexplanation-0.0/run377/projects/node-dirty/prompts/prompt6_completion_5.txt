  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This code fragment will delete the key from the `_data` map, which is the opposite of what the original code does. This change will cause the `set` method to delete the key instead of setting it, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This code fragment will set the key to a different value than what was passed in, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This code fragment will set the key to `undefined`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method.

DONE.
