  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `flatten` function.
