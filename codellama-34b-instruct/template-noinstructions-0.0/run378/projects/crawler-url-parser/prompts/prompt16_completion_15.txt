  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact and add a space character to the end of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact and add a question mark character to the end of the URL.

DONE.
