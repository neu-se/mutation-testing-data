  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `callback` function, which might cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the second argument to the `callback` function, which might cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
