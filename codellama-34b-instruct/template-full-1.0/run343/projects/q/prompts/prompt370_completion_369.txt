```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the given reason, while `_progressed` is a function that returns the given value. Calling `_rejected` instead of `_progressed` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of being resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise with the given value, while `_progressed` is a function that returns the given value. Calling `_fulfilled` instead of `_progressed` would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of being resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Some error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected(new Error("Some error message"))` is a function that returns a rejected
