 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop in certain conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the previous operation, which is not equivalent to the next operation in the context of the diff algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext() ? otherIter.next() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a conditional check, potentially causing different behavior in the diff algorithm when the other iterator is empty.

DONE.
