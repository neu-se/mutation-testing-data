  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `a` directly, while the replaced code fragment is using the value of `a + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `a`, while the replaced code fragment is using the value of `b`, which is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `a` directly, while the replaced code fragment is using the value of `a * b`, which is a different value.

DONE.
