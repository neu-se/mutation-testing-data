  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `this.hasNext`, so if `this.hasNext` is true, `!this.hasNext` will be false, and vice versa. This change would cause the `rest()` method to return an empty array instead of the remaining ops in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasNext` is a method, not a property, so `this.hasNext()` would call the method and return its result, which is a boolean value indicating whether there are more ops in the iterator. This change would cause the `rest()` method to return an empty array if there are no more ops, and the remaining ops otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior
