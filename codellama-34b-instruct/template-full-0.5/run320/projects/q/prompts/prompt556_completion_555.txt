  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is reversed, which could cause the program to behave differently if the callbacks have side effects or if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the same callback is being used for both the success and failure cases, which could cause the program to behave differently if the callback has different behavior for these cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, function () {}, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because two empty functions are being used as callbacks, which could cause the program to behave differently if the callbacks have side effects or if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
