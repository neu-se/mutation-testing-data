  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `nextStream` function to be called, even if the `end` value is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator that evaluates to `true` if both operands are truthy. In this case, if `end` is `false`, the `stream` variable will be ignored and the `if` statement will evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextStream` function to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator that evaluates to `true` if either operand is truthy. In this case, if `end` is `false
