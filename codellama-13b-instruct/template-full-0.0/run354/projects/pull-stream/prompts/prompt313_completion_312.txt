  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function would not be called, and the `read` function would not be called with `true` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function would be called, and the `read` function would be called with `true` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function would not be called, and the `read` function would be called with `true` as the first argument.

DONE.
