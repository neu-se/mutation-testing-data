  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different subset of `base` when the `retain` op is applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different subset of `base` when the `retain` op is applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different subset of `base` when the `retain` op is applied.

DONE.
