 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always adds '1' to the imaginary part, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the sign determined by `minus % 2 ? '-' : ''` and just parses the number as a float.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random number to the imaginary part, instead of the intended value.

DONE.
