  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `npost` method is used to call a method on an object, while the `nget` method is used to retrieve a property from an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `npost` method is used to call a method on an object, while the `nset` method is used to set a property on an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `npost` method is used to call a method on an object, while the `ndelete` method is used to delete a property from an object.

DONE.
