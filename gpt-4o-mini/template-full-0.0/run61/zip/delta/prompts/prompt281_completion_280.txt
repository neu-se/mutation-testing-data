Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume one operation from the iterator instead of just peeking at the length, potentially altering the state of the iterator and affecting subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the next operation instead of its length, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operation if the type is not 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume that the length is zero, causing the method to skip processing any operations, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect results.

DONE.
