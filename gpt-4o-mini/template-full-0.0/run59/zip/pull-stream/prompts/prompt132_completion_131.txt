Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements `i` instead of incrementing it, which could lead to an infinite loop if `i` becomes negative and `max` is a positive number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the addition operator instead of the increment operator, which does not modify `i` in place, leaving `i` unchanged and potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the function to skip over valid states and potentially lead to unexpected results when `i` exceeds `max`.

DONE.
