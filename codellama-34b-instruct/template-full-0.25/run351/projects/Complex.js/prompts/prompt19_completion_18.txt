  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and the code would be using the wrong variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to `y`, which would change the result of the `hypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be taking the square root of `y`, which would change the result of the `hypot` function.

DONE.
