  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw error` would throw the error and reject the promise, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the error, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

DONE.
