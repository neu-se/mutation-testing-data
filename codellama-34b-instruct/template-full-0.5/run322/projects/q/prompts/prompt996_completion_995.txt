  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call with no arguments, while the modified code fragment is a function call with one argument, `null`. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call with no arguments, while the modified code fragment is a function call with one argument, the string "foo". This could potentially cause the function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call with no arguments, while the modified code fragment is a function call with one argument, the number 42. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently,
