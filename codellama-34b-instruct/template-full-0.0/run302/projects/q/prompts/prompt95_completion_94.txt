  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `++` operator to increment `index` before comparing it to `length`, while this replacement code fragment increments `index` after comparing it to `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `++` operator to increment `index` before comparing it to `length`, while this replacement code fragment increments `index` after comparing it to `length + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `++` operator to increment `index` before comparing it to `length`, while this replacement code fragment increments `index + 1` before comparing it to `length`.

DONE.
