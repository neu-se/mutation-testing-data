  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex.isZero` checks whether a complex number is equal to zero, while the original code `z['isZero']()` checks whether the given number is equal to zero and returns a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex.isZero` checks whether a complex number is equal to zero, while the above code checks whether a given object is equal to zero and returns a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex.notZero` checks whether a complex number is not equal to zero, while the original code `z['isZero']()` checks whether the given number is equal to zero and returns a boolean.

DONE.
