Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Mapper failed'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new error object to the callback, which would cause the calling function to handle an error scenario instead of a successful data return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `data` directly to the callback instead of `null`, which could lead to unexpected results if the callback is not designed to handle data in this manner.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends two `null` values to the callback, which may not be handled correctly by the consumer of the callback, potentially leading to confusion or errors in processing the response.

DONE.
