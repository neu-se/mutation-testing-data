  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `regardless` is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `regardless` is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise object, whereas `regardless` is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
