  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `end` is falsy, while `!end` is checking if `end` is truthy. This could cause the program to behave differently when `end` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && data` is checking if `end` and `data` are both truthy, while the original code fragment is only checking if `end` is falsy. This could cause the program to behave differently when `end` and `data` have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || data` is checking if `end` or `data` are truthy, while the original code fragment is only checking if `end` is falsy. This could cause the program to behave differently when `end
