 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(op: any, index: any) => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `any` instead of the correct types for the parameters, potentially causing type-related issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(op, index) => predicate(index, op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters, causing the predicate to receive incorrect arguments and potentially leading to incorrect filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(op: Op, index: number) => index
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the index instead of the result of the predicate, causing the filter method to return an array with the same length as the original `ops` array, instead of filtering the elements based on the predicate.

DONE.
