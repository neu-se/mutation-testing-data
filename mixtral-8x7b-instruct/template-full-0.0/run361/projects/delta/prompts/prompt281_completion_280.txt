 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` value is multiplied by 2, which may cause the loop to iterate incorrectly or cause unexpected behavior in the `delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'thisIter.peekLength'.length
