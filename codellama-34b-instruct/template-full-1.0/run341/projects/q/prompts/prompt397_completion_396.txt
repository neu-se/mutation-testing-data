  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the specified reason, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function(value) { return rejected; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that is rejected with the `rejected` value, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return rejected; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that is resolved with the `rejected` value, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value.

DONE.
