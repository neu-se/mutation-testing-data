  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0, w.length - 1` would return a substring of the input string starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character, while the new code fragment `0, w.length - 2` would return a substring starting from the first character and ending at the third-to-last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0, w.length - 1` would return a substring of the input string starting from the first character and ending at the last character, while the new code fragment `1, w.length - 1` would return a substring starting from the second character and ending at the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
