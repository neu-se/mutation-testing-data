  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but this new code fragment subtracts the radian values directly, which could result in a different angle calculation and therefore a different destination point.

DONE.
