Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('://')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the URL instead of ensuring it has a default protocol, potentially leading to malformed URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly set the default protocol to 'ftp://' instead of 'http://', which could lead to unexpected behavior when handling web URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the default protocol to 'https://' instead of 'http://', which may not be the intended behavior for URLs that are not secure.

DONE.
