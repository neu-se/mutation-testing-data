  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the bearing to be performed in radians instead of degrees, which would lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the bearing to be performed twice as fast as it would be in the original code, which would lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the bearing to be performed in radians instead of degrees, which would lead to a different result.

DONE.
