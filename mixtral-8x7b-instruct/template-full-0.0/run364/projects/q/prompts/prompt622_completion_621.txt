 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of using an array with two elements. The `set` method expects an array with two elements, where the first element is the property key and the second element is the property value. By replacing it with an object, the `set` method will behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['key', 'value']
