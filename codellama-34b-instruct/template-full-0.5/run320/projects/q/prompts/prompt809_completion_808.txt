  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply()` would be called with an empty array as the second argument, which would cause the function to be called with no arguments, even if the original code fragment was called with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, [undefined])
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply()` would be called with an array containing `undefined` as the second argument, which would cause the function to be called with a single argument of `undefined`, even if the original code fragment was called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, [null])
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply()` would be called with an array containing `null` as the second argument, which would cause the function to be called with a single argument of `null`, even if the original code fragment was called with no arguments
