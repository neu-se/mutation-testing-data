  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always try to access one more element than the length of the iterator, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always try to access one less element than the length of the iterator, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always try to access twice as many elements as the length of the iterator, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
