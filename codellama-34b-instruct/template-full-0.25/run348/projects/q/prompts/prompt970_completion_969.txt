  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the name, which may not be a valid method name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the name to uppercase, which may not be a valid method name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the name into an array of individual characters, which may not be a valid method name.

DONE.
