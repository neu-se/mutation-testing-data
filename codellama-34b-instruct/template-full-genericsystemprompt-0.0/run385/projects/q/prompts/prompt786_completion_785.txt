  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same behavior as `void 0`, which is a special value that is used to indicate the absence of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same behavior as `void 0`, which is a special value that is used to indicate the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and it would not have the same behavior as `void 0`, which is a special value that is used to indicate the absence of a value.

DONE.
