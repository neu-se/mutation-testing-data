 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return callback; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise from `finally` would always resolve to a function that returns the original callback, rather than the actual resolved/rejected value of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because if the callback function uses `this` within its implementation, the value of `this` would now be bound to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) instead of the promise instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be invoked immediately, rather than being passed as a function reference to be called when the promise is settled.

DONE.
