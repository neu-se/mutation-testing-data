  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This code fragment uses the difference between the longitudes of the two points, multiplies it by the ratio of the circumference of the Earth to its diameter (π/180), and then uses the result as the argument for the `acos` function. This will give the correct value for the distance between the two points, but it is a different implementation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This code fragment uses the difference between the longitudes of the two points, multiplies it by the ratio of the diameter of the Earth to its circumference (180/π), and then uses the result as the argument for the `acos` function. This will give the correct value for the distance between the two points, but it is a different implementation than the original code.
