  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the size of the data would be increased by 1, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the size of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the size of the data would be decreased by 1, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the size of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the size of the data would be doubled, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the size of the data.

DONE.
