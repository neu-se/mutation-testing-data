 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise.thenReturn(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`promise.inspect`) returns an object with details about the promise, while `promise.thenReturn(null)` always returns a resolved promise with a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`promise.inspect`) returns an object with details about the promise, while `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise with no payload.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise.catch(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`promise.inspect`) returns an object with details about the promise, while `promise.catch(() => {})` returns a promise that ignores any errors and always resolves to `undefined`.

DONE.
