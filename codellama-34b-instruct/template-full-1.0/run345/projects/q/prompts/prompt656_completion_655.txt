  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_shift` modifies the original array, whereas `array_slice` creates a new array from the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[method]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[method]` refers to the method of the object, whereas the original code refers to a standalone function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(index) { return array[index] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new function that refers to the original `array` and `index`, whereas the original code does not define a new function.

DONE.
