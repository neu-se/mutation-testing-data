This change would result in the callback being executed even if the promise is rejected, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This change would result in the callback being executed only if the promise is still pending, and not if it has already been resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true if the inspected state is "
