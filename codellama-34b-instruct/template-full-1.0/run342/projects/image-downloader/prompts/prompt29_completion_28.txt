  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be set to the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could result in a different set of headers being sent to the server.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wss'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be set to the `ws` module instead of the `https` module, which could result in a different set of headers being sent to the server.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be set to the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could result in a different set of headers being sent to the server.

DONE.
