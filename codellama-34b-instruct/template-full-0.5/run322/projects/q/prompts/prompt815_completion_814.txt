  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason, whereas this modified code fragment returns the reason directly, which would result in a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason, whereas this modified code fragment returns a rejected promise with the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason, whereas this modified code fragment returns a fulfilled promise with the reason.

DONE.
