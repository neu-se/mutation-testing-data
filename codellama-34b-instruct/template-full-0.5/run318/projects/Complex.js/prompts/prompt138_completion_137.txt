  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity. If the value is Not-a-Number, the `sub` method would return `Complex['NAN']`, while if the value is Infinity, it would return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the value is zero, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity. If the value is zero, the `sub` method would return `Complex['ZERO']`, while if the value is Infinity, it would return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior
