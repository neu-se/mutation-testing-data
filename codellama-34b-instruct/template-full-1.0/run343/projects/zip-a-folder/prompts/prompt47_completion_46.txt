  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory in the archive, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute path of the `src` directory, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the directory name of the current module, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
