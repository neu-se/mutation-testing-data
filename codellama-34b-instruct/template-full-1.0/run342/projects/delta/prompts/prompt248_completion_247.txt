  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the iteration, while `thisIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next().length()` returns the length of the op being returned, while `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op in the other iteration, while `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next op.

DONE.
