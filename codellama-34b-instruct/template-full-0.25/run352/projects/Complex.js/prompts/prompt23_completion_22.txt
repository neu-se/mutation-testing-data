  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than `b`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` is greater than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than `b`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than `b`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` is equal to `b`.

DONE.
