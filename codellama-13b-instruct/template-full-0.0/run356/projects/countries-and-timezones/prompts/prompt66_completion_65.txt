  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is now being accessed directly from the `options` object, rather than being passed as a parameter to the `deliverCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` property is now being accessed directly from the `options` object, rather than being passed as a parameter to the `deliverCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.allTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allTimezones` property is now being accessed directly from the `options` object, rather than being passed as a parameter to the `deliverCountry` function.

DONE.
