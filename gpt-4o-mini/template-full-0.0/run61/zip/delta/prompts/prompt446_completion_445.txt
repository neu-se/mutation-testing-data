Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly assumes that the `ops` array elements are objects with a `length` property, which may not be the case, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect length calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(this.ops[this.index]) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the length returned by `Op.length`, which would cause the `peekLength` method to return a value that is always greater than the actual length, potentially affecting the logic in the `next` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 for the length, causing the `next` method to incorrectly assume that there are no operations left to process, leading to premature termination of iteration.

DONE.
