'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'load'` is emitted when the database is successfully loaded, while the event `'error'` is emitted when there is an error.

Replacing `'load'` with `'drain'` would cause the database to emit a drain event when it is successfully loaded, which would be incorrect and could cause issues in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'load'` is emitted when the database is
