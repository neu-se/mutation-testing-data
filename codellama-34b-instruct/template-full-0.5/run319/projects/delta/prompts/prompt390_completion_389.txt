  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekType())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for the length of the current operation.

DONE.
