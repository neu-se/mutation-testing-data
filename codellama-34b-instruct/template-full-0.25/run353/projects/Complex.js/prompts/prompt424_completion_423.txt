  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of `isInfinite`, making the code return `true` if the number is not Infinity, and `false` if it is Infinity.

DONE.
