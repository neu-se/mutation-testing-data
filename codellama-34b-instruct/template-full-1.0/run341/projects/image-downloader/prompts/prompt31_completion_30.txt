  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft().startsWith('https') ? https : http;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `url.trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>).startsWith('https')` which trims the left side of the URL and then checks if it starts with 'https', whereas the new code just checks if the URL starts with 'https' without trimming the left side.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.startsWith('https') ? https : http;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `url.trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>).startsWith('https')` which trims the left side of the URL and then checks if it starts with 'https', whereas the new code just checks if the URL starts with 'https' without trimming the left side.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft('https') === 'https' ? https : http;
```
