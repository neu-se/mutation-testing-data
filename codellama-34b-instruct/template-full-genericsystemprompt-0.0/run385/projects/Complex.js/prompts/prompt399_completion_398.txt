  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result of the `acos` function to be incremented by 1, which would change the final result of the `acosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result of the `acos` function to be decremented by 1, which would also change the final result of the `acosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result of the `acos` function to be multiplied by 2, which would change the final result of the `acosh` function.

DONE.
