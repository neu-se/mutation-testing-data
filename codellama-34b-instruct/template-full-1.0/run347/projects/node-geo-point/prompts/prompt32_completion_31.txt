  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(point2.longitude + <constant>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `PLACEHOLDER` code fragment is used to calculate the denominator in the `acos` function, which is used to determine the distance between two points. By adding a constant to `point2.longitude`, the denominator would be affected, leading to a different distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(point2.latitude - <constant>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `PLACEHOLDER` code fragment is used to calculate the numerator in the `acos` function, which is used to determine the distance between two points. By subtracting a constant from `point2.latitude`, the numerator would be affected, leading to a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(point2.longitude + point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because
