  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `inverted` delta object, which removes any trailing retain ops with a length of 0. Replacing it with `inverted.chop` would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `inverted` delta object without any arguments, which removes any trailing retain ops with a length of 0. Replacing it with `inverted.chop(1)` would remove any trailing retain ops with a length of 1 instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the
