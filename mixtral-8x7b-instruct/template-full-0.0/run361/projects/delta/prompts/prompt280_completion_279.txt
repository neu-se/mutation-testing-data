 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method of the `Op` class would be called on a string instead of an object, which could lead to different length calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method of the `Op` class would be called on a number or an object, which would throw an error since `length` is not a valid property for these types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method of the `Op` class would be called on a boolean (since `thisOp.delete` is a boolean), which would throw an error since `length` is not a valid property for booleans.

DONE.
