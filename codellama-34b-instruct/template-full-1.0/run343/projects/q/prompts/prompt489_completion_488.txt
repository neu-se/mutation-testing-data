  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the unhandled rejections array when the promise library is initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not reset the unhandled rejections array when the promise library is initialized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not reset the unhandled rejections array when the promise library is initialized, but would also not indicate that the rejections should be tracked.

DONE.
