  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern `\u0000` matches any null character, while the original pattern `\uFEFF` matches the Unicode byte order mark (BOM).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split(/^\uFEFF/).join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` and `join()` methods are used instead of `replace()` method, and the regular expression pattern `\uFEFF` is used to split the string on the BOM character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern `\uFEFF` is used to match the BOM character, but the `g` flag is added to replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string, while the original code only replaced the first occurrence.

DONE.
