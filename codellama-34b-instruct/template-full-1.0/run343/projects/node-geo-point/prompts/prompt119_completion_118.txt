  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would flip the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
180 - bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be calculated as the difference between 180 degrees and the original bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2 - bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be calculated as the difference between 90 degrees (Ï€/2) and the original bearing.

DONE.
