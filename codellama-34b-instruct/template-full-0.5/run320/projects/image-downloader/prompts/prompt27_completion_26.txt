  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is not the same as the `options` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest` property is not the same as the `options.url` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.href
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest.href` property is not the same as the `options.dest` property.

DONE.
