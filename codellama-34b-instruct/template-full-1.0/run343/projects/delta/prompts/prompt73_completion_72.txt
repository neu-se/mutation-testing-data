  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` expects an array as its argument, whereas `push` expects a single value. If `concat` is used, it will treat the provided argument as an array and push all its elements individually, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array and returns it, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array. Using `shift` would result in a different array being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array. Using `slice` would result in a different array being returned.

DONE.
