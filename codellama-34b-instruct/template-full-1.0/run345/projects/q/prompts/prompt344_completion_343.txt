  Sure, here are three different options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not truthy, meaning that it would not match the if statement's condition and would not execute the code inside the if block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Intentional error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an intentional error inside the `Q` promise, which would reject the promise and cause the corresponding failure callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value.toLowerCase(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the lowercased version of the `value` variable, which would cause the `then` method's success callback to be called with the lowercased value instead of the original value.
