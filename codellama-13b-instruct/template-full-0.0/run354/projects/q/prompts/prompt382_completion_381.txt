  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is used to register an observer on a promise, whereas the original code fragment `Q` is a reference to the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.isPromise` function is used to check if an object is a promise, whereas the original code fragment `Q` is a reference to the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.isPromiseAlike` function is used to check if an object is promise-like, whereas the original code fragment `Q` is a reference to the `Q` object.

DONE.
