  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an object property, while `a + 1` is an arithmetic expression that returns a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an object property, while `b` is a different object property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an object property, while `a * b` is an arithmetic expression that returns a different value.

DONE.
