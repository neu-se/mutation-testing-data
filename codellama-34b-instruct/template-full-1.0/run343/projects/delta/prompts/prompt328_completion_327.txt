  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.retain` is a method call, unlike `baseOp` which is an object reference. This would cause the rest of the code to behave differently and potentially cause a null pointer exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert` is an attribute, unlike `baseOp` which is an object reference. This would cause the rest of the code to behave differently and potentially cause a type mismatch exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.length` is a method call, unlike `baseOp` which is an object reference. This would cause the rest of the code to behave differently and potentially cause a null pointer exception.

DONE.
