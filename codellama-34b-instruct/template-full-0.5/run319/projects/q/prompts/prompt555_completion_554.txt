  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `errback` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Replacing it with `null` would cause the program to throw a `TypeError` when `when` is called, as `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `errback` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Replacing it with an empty function would cause the program to execute the `callback` function with no arguments, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error) { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `errback` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Replacing it with a function that throws the `error` argument
