Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `hasNext()` to always return `false` when the index is greater than 0, leading to incorrect behavior when checking for the presence of subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the length of the operations array is less than `Infinity`, which would always be true, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the availability of next operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `hasNext()` to return `true` even when there are no more operations left to iterate over, as it would incorrectly evaluate the peek length based on the incremented index.

DONE.
