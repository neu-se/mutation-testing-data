  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("test"));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called with a new Error object, causing the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would call `deferred.resolve` with the result of `nodeback`, which would resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(nodeback);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the `nodeback` function itself, causing the promise to be resolved with a function, whereas the original code would call `deferred.resolve` with the result of calling `nodeback` with the appropriate arguments, which would resolve the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(nodeback);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called with the `nodeback` function itself, causing the promise to
