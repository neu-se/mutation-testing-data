  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate the first op from the other Delta, instead of all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty Delta, regardless of the contents of the other Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original Delta, without concatenating any ops from the other Delta.

DONE.
