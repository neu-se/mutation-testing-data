```diff
- return <PLACEHOLDER>("get", [key]);
+ return this.dispatch("set", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` dispatch method is replaced with `set`, which would update the property with the given key instead of retrieving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- return <PLACEHOLDER>("get", [key]);
+ return this.dispatch("post", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` dispatch method is replaced with `post`, which would send a post request to the same url with the given key instead of retrieving the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- return <PLACEHOLDER>("get", [key]);
+ return this.dispatch("apply", [key, []]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` dispatch method is replaced with `apply`, which would apply
