  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is being called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is being called with a different property, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is being called with a different index, which could potentially return a different value.

DONE.
