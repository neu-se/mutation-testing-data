  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are two different functions that serve different purposes in the context of promises. `resolve` is used to fulfill a promise, while `reject` is used to reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to throw an error, which would be propagated to the promise returned by `Q.async` and result in a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a promise that is already fulfilled with the value `null`, which would be propagated to the promise returned by `Q.async` and result in a fulfillment.

DONE.
