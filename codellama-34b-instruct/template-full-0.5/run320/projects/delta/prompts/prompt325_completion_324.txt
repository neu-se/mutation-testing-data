  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is not initialized in the provided code snippet, so using it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `base` delta's ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return a larger subset of the `base` delta's ops, which could affect the outcome of the `reduce` method.

DONE.
