  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the iterator to advance by one more element than it should, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the iterator to advance by twice as many elements as it should, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the iterator to advance by one fewer element than it should, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
