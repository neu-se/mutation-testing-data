  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `a`, which is not the correct implementation of the `tan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tangent of `b + 1`, which is not the correct implementation of the `tan` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cotangent of `-b`, which is not the correct implementation of the `cot` function.

DONE.
