Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'extends' property itself is an object with a property, rather than checking if the 'extends' property exists in the config object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defaultConfig
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the 'extends' property in the defaultConfig object instead of the config object, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the 'extends' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'extends' property exists in the context object (this) instead of the config object, which could lead to unexpected behavior and errors if the context object does not have an 'extends' property.

DONE.
