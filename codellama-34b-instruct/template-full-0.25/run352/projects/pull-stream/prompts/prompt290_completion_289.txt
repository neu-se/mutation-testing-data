  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!field
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would negate the value of `field`, potentially causing the `unique` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is an addition, which would add 1 to the value of `field`, potentially causing the `unique` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would convert the value of `field` to uppercase, potentially causing the `unique` function to return a different result.

DONE.
