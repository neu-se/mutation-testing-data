  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.reject` with the error object as an argument, while this modified code fragment calls `deferred.reject` with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.resolve` with the resolved value as an argument, while this modified code fragment calls `deferred.resolve` with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.makeNodeResolver().resolve` with the resolved value as an argument, while this modified code fragment calls `
