  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `r` variable, which is used in the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `r` variable, which is used in the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `r` variable, which is used in the calculation of the complex square root.

DONE.
