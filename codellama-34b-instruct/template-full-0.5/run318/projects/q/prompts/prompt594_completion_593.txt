  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `null.promiseDispatch()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `undefined.promiseDispatch()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a reference to the current execution context, which is not necessarily the same as the `self` variable. If the code is running in a different context, such as a callback or event handler, then `this` would refer to that context rather than the original context where `self` was defined.

DONE.
