Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's values instead of its keys, which would lead to incorrect handling of the `otherData` object in the transformation logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, which would not match the expected structure of a single key in the transformation logic, potentially causing errors or incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns all properties (including non-enumerable ones) of an object, which may include properties that are not relevant for the transformation, leading to unexpected results in the handling of `otherData`.

DONE.
