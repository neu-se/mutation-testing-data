 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `inverted.chop`, is missing the parentheses to actually call the `chop` method, making it a no-op. By adding the parentheses, the `chop` method will be called, potentially changing the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.pop;
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.pop` is accessing the `pop` property of the `inverted` object, which is likely not defined. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.push(1, 2, 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method of the `inverted` object is being called with multiple arguments, while it only accepts
