  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes an array with `name` and `nodeArgs` as elements, while this code passes `nodeArgs` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(object).dispatch("post", nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not reject the promise, while this code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("put", nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method, while this code uses the "put" method.

DONE.
