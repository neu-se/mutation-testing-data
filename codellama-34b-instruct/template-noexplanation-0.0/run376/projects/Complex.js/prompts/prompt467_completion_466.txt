  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result when the imaginary part of the complex number is not zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result when the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result when the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

DONE.
