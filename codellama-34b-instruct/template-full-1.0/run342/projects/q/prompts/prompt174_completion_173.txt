  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the line number by one, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always double the line number, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always decrement the line number by one, regardless of the input.

DONE.
