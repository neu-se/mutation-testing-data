Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function from using a callback-based approach to a promise-based approach, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections if the write operation fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it would switch from an asynchronous write operation to a synchronous one, which could block the event loop and lead to performance issues in an asynchronous context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.appendFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from writing a new file to appending data to an existing file, which could lead to unexpected data being written if the file already exists.

DONE.
