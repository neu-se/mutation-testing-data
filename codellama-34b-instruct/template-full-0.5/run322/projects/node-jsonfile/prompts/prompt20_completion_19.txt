  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and it would cause the `readFileSync` function to use a different encoding than the one specified in the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"utf-8"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `readFileSync` function to always use the "utf-8" encoding, regardless of the encoding specified in the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `readFileSync` function to use the default encoding, which is not the same as the encoding specified in the `options` object.

DONE.
