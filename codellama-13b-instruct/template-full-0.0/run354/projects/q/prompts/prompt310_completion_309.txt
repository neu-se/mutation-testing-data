  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the third `resolve` call would be executed twice, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the second `resolve` call, rather than the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the third `reject` call would be executed, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason of the third `reject` call, rather than the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, resolve, reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth `reject` call would be executed, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason of the fourth `reject` call, rather than the first one.

DONE.
