  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the next operation instead of the next operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the number of elements in the next operation, instead of by one element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(Math.min(otherOp.retain, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by at most one element, regardless of the number of elements in the next operation.

DONE.
