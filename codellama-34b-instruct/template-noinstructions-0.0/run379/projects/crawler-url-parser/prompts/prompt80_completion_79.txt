  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, while the new code fragment uses the `attr` method to set the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'new_value')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `href` attribute, while the new code fragment sets the value of the `href` attribute to `'new_value'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).removeAttr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, while the new code fragment removes the `href` attribute from the element.

DONE.
