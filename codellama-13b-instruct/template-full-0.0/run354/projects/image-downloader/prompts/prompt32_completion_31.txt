  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the status code is not equal to 200, while this code fragment checks if it is equal to 200. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the status code is 200, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the status code is not equal to 200, while this code fragment checks if it is less than 200. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the status code is less than 200, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode > 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
