  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete(0)` would delete the first element of the `inverted` array, while `inverted.chop()` would remove the last element of the `inverted` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.push(0)` would add a new element to the end of the `inverted` array, while `inverted.chop()` would remove the last element of the `inverted` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.pop()` would remove the last element of the `inverted` array, while `inverted.chop()` would remove the last element of the `inverted` array.
