  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 10 to the latitude value, which could cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add pi to the longitude value, which could cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

DONE.
