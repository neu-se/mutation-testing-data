  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would return `null` instead of the parsed object, which would cause the `readFileSync` function to return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would return `undefined` instead of the parsed object, which would cause the `readFileSync` function to return `undefined` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would return an empty object instead of the parsed object, which would cause the `readFileSync` function to return an empty object instead of the expected object.

DONE.
