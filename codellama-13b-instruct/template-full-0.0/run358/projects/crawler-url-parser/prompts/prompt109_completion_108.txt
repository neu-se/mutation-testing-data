  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the second reference to `currentUrl.url` would be accessing the property of the `currentUrl` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the second reference to `currentUrl.url` would be accessing the `host` property of the `currentUrl` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the second reference to `currentUrl.url` would be accessing the `protocol` property of the `currentUrl` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
