  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER
can be replaced with:
```
reason.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally
reject the promise with the length of the reason, rather than the reason
itself, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles
rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally
increment the length of the unhandled reasons array, which could cause
unexpected behavior in the code that tracks unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally
set the index at which the reason is stored to -1, which could cause
unexpected behavior in the code that handles unhandled rejections.

DONE.
