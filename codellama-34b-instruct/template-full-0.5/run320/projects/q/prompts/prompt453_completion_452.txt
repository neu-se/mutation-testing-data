  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `pop` removes the last element from an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `shift` removes the first element from an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `splice` removes a specified number of elements from a specified index in an array.

DONE.
