  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"progressed"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, and would therefore throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be passed as the progress callback to `deferred.notify()`, which would not update the progress in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, and would therefore throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

DONE.
