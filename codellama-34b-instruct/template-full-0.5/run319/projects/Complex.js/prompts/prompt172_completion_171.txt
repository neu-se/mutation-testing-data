  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite. If the complex number is zero, the `div` method would return `NaN` instead of `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isInfinite`, so if the complex number is infinite, the method would return `Complex['ZERO']` instead of `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the complex number is not a number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite. If the complex number is not a number, the `div` method would return `NaN` instead of
