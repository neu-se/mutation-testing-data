  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object. This could cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if `lastOp.delete` is not undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp.delete` is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if `lastOp.insert` is not undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp.insert` is not undefined.

DONE.
