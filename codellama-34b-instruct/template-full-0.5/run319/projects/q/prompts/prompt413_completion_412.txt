  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object === "function"` would always return `false` since `object` is not a function, but rather an object. In the original code, `isObject` is a function that checks if a value is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object instanceof Object` would always return `true` since `object` is an object, but the original code checks if `object` is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object && typeof object.then === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `object && typeof object.then === "function"` would return `false` if `object` is not a promise-like object, but the original code checks if `object` is a promise-like object and returns `true` if it is.

DONE.
