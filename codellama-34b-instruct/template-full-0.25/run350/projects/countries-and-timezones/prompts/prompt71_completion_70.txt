  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + "abc")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` parameter is modified, which could cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` parameter is modified, which could cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` parameter is modified, which could cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

DONE.
