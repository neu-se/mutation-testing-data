  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer["deferred"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new deferred object with `Q.defer`, while the replaced code uses a property of an existing deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `defer` method to create a new deferred object, while the replaced code uses the `resolve` method of an existing deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `defer` method to create a new deferred object, while the replaced code uses the `reject` method of an existing deferred object.

DONE.
