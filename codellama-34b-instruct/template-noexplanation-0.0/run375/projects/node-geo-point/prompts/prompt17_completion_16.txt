  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This code fragment reverses the order of the coordinates in the `point.coordinates` array, which could potentially cause issues with the `fromLngLatArray` method if it relies on a specific order for the coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This code fragment removes the first element of the `point.coordinates` array, which could potentially cause issues with the `fromLngLatArray` method if it relies on a specific number of coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0, 0])
```
This code fragment adds two new elements to the `point.coordinates` array, which could potentially cause issues with the `fromLngLatArray` method if it relies on a specific number of coordinates.

DONE.
