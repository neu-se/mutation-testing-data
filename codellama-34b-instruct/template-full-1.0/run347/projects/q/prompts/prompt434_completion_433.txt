  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the value of `trackUnhandledRejections`, causing the conditional statement to be skipped if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromiseAlike(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if `reason` is a promise, and the `!` operator is used to negate the result. If `reason` is a promise, the conditional statement will be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPending(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function checks if `reason` is a pending promise (neither fulfilled nor rejected), and the `!` operator is used to negate the result. If `reason` is a pending promise, the conditional
