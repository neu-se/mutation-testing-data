  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array instead of an array of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a different name than the one passed in, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects that are not associated with the specified timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"America/New_York"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a different name than the one passed in, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects that are not associated with the specified timezone.

DONE.
