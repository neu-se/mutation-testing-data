  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `verbs` is a reference to the original array. If the `deny` method is called with a single verb, it will only deny that specific verb, whereas `verbs.slice()` will deny all verbs in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice(1)` creates a new array with all elements except the first one, whereas `verbs` is a reference to the original array. If the `deny` method is called with a single verb, it will only deny that specific verb, whereas `verbs.slice(1)` will deny all verbs except the first one in the array.
