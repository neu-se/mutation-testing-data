  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not returning the expected value, and the `valueOf` function is not being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not returning the expected value, and the `valueOf` function is not being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not returning the expected value, and the `valueOf` function is not being called.

DONE.
