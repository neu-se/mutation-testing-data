  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `b`, while the replaced code fragment uses the negative of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment adds 1 to `b` before using it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment squares `b` before using it.

DONE.
