  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed with the `key` and `value` arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed with the `key` and `"value"` arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed with the `key` and `undefined` arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
