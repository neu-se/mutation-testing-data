 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'mice' for the input 'mouse', while this change would return 'mouses'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a special case for the letter 'o' at the end of the word, while this change would append 'es' to any word ending in 'o', regardless of whether the letter before it is a vowel or consonant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mooses'
