  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is the opposite of `cork`, which means that it would allow the stream to continue flowing instead of being blocked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork ? 1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `1` instead of `0` for an empty queue, which would then call the `cork` method on the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork ? this._writeStream.cork() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cork` method on the write stream if the queue is not empty, which would block the stream.

DONE.
