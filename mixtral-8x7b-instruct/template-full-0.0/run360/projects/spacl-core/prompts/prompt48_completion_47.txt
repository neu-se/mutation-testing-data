 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `null` instead of an empty string to the `props` array, potentially causing issues in the code that relies on the `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
window.props.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the global `window.props` array instead of the local `props` array, causing the pushed value to be stored in the wrong place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.match(/:.+/)?.[0].slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only pushes the first captured group (if any) instead of the entire part string, which may cause issues in the code that relies on the `props` array.

DONE.
