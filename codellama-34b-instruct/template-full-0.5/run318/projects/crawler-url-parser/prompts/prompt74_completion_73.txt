  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').replace(/^.*:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` function to parse the HTML string and retrieve the `href` attribute of the `base` element. However, this code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the protocol and domain from the URL, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the protocol and domain from the URL, while this code fragment uses the `split` method to split the URL into an array and then retrieves the last element of the array using the `pop` method. This would result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').match(/[^/]*$/)[0]
