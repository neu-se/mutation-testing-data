  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object, but with the arguments in a different order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object with the arguments in a specific order, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object with the arguments in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to call the named method of the object with a specific number of arguments, while the bug
