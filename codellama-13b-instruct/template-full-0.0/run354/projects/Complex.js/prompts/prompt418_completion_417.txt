  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method returns `true` if the complex number is infinite, while the original code fragment returns `true` if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method returns `true` if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while the original code fragment returns `true` if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method returns `true` if the complex number is finite, while the original code fragment returns `true` if the complex number is zero.

DONE.
