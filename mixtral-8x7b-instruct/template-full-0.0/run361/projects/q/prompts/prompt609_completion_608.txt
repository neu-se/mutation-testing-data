 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of being resolved with the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be updated with the progress of the operation instead of being resolved or rejected with the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind(null, deferred.resolve, 0, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolution of the promise would be delayed by a single tick, which could cause race conditions or other issues if the promise is expected to be resolved synchronously.

DONE.
