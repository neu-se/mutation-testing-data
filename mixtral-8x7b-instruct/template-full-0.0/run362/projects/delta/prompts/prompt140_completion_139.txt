 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<'
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'` would always be false, causing the `Delta.compose` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'` would always be false, causing the `Delta.compose` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'` would be based on the length of the operation, causing the `Delta.compose` method to behave differently.

DONE
