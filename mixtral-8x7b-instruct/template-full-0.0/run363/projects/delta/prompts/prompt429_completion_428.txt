 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value is multiplied by 2, which may not be the expected length of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the index against the length of the ops array instead of checking the peekLength. This may lead to incorrect hasNext results when there are operations with a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns false, causing the iterator to never proceed to the next operation.

DONE.
