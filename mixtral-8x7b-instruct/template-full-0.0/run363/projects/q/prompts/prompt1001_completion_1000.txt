 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `dispatch` method from `Q(object)` to the current promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from the instance method `dispatch` to the static method `Q.dispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() > 0.5 ? this.dispatch : Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces non-determinism to the code, where sometimes the original behavior is preserved and sometimes it is not.

DONE.
