  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the object returned by `nfapply` in the original code fragment, so it would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).nodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method is not defined on the object returned by `nfapply` in the original code fragment, so it would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).cfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cfapply` method is not defined on the object returned by `nfapply` in the original code fragment, so it would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
