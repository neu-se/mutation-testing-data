  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object would be incremented by 1, which could affect the logic of the `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object would be decremented by 1, which could also affect the logic of the `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object would be multiplied by 2, which could significantly change the result of the `reduce` method.

DONE.
