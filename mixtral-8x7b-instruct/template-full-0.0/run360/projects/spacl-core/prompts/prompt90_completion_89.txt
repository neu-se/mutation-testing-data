 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the `policies` array using `const` instead of using `let`, which means that the `policy` variable will not be reassigned in each iteration. This could lead to adding the same policy multiple times if there are duplicate policy names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < policies.length; i++) {
  const policy = policies[i];
  this.set(policy.name, policy);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a traditional `for` loop with an index variable `i` to iterate over the `policies` array, which is less idiomatic and less concise than using a `for...of` loop. This could lead to subtle bugs if the loop is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
