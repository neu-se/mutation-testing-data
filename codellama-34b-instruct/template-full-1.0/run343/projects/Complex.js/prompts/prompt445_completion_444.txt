  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 10, places || 1, which would result in different behavior because it would make the function always round to the nearest integer, even for numbers less than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 10, places || -1, which would result in different behavior because it would round to the nearest negative integer for numbers less than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 10, places % 2, which would result in different behavior because it would round to the nearest even number for numbers less than 1.

DONE.
