Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the provided object instead of returning the original promise, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the flow of the promise chain by returning a new promise that resolves with the result of the callback, rather than observing the original promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only handle rejections from the promise, ignoring the fulfillment case, which could lead to missed opportunities to process fulfilled values.

DONE.
