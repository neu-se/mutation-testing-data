  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different array than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the argument array, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different array than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array by filtering the elements of the original array based on the provided function, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different array than the original code.

DONE.
