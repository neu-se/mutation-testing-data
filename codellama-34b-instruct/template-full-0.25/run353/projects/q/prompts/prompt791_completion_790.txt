  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(regardless, regardless);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise, even if the original promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(regardless, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise, even if the original promise was rejected, and it would not call the `noop` function if the promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(noop, regardless);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise, even if the original promise was fulfilled, and it would not call the `noop` function if the promise was fulfilled.

DONE.
