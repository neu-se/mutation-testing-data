  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is modified to match any character except for the ones specified in the character class, which would allow for the presence of special characters in the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/^\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is modified to match any character except for the ones specified in the character class, which would allow for the presence of special characters in the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is modified to match any character except for the ones specified in the character class, which would allow for the presence of special characters in the path.

DONE.
