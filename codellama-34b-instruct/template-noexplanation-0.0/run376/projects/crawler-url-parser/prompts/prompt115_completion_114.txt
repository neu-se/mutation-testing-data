  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This code fragment will return an iterator over the keys of the `urlMap` object, which is a set of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries
```
This code fragment will return an iterator over the entries of the `urlMap` object, which are pairs of URLs and their corresponding values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values
```
This code fragment will return an iterator over the values of the `urlMap` object, which are the `currentUrl` objects.

DONE.
