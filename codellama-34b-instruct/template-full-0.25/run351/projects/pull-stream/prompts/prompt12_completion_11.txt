  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the function to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be entered, and the function would return without performing any operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate until the condition is no longer true, potentially causing the function to access an index that is out of bounds.

DONE.
