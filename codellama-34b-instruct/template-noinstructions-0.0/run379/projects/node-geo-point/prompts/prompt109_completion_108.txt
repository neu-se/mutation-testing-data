  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the tile to be offset by one zoom level, which would result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the tile to be offset by one zoom level in the opposite direction, which would also result in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the tile to be double the size, which would result in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
