  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this replacement returns a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception with the reason as the message, while this replacement throws an error with the reason as the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason.message; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception with the reason as the message, while this replacement returns the message of the reason.

DONE.
