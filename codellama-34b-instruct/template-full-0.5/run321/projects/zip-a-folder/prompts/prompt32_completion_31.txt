  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'close' is not the same as the event 'error', and the code would not behave as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'finish' is not the same as the event 'error', and the code would not behave as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'end' is not the same as the event 'error', and the code would not behave as expected.

DONE.
