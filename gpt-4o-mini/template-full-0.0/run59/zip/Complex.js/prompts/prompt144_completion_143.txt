Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because using `true` instead of a variable will cause the condition to always evaluate to `true`, leading to a return of `Complex['NAN']` whenever either operand is infinite, regardless of whether the other operand is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this['re']` instead of a variable will cause the multiplication check to depend on the real part of the current complex number, which may not be zero, thus potentially allowing for a valid multiplication operation instead of returning `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because using `z['im']` will check the imaginary part of the second complex number instead of the zero condition, which could lead to incorrect handling of the multiplication when one of the numbers is infinite, potentially returning `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']`.

DONE.
