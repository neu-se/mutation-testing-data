  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the first argument, but the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the first two arguments, but the new code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the first three arguments, but the new code fragment does not.

DONE.
