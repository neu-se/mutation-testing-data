  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._flush` is a method that flushes the queue, but `this._flush(key)` would only flush the queue for the specified key, which could cause some writes to be missed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._flush(key, val)` would only flush the queue for the specified key and value, which could cause some writes to be missed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(key, val, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._flush(key, val, cb)` would only flush the queue for the specified key, value, and callback, which could cause some writes to be missed.

DONE.
