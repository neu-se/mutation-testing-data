  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event listener, and would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to reject the promise with an error, even if the archive is successfully created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('close', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to resolve the promise with the output stream, even if the archive is not successfully created.

DONE.
