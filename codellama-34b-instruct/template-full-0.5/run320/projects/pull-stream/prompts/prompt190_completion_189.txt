  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `map === null` is not the same as `!map`. The former checks if the `map` variable is null, while the latter checks if the `map` variable is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, false, etc.).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map && !map.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `map && !map.length` checks if the `map` variable is truthy and its length is 0, while `!map` checks if the `map` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `map.length === 0` checks if the `map` variable has a length of 0, while `!map` checks if the `map` variable is falsy.

DONE.
