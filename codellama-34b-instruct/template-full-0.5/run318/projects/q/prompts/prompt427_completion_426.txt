  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function than `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation that could cause the promise to be handled differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` is the opposite of `isPromise`, and it may cause the promise to be handled differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` is a different function than `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation that could cause the promise to be handled differently.

DONE.
