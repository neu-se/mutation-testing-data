  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string `''` is not the same as the dollar sign `$`, which is used to indicate the end of the string in regular expressions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '^'
```
This would result in different behavior because the caret `^` is not the same as the dollar sign `$`, which is used to indicate the end of the string in regular expressions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash `\` is not the same as the dollar sign `$`, which is used to indicate the end of the string in regular expressions.

DONE.
