  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object to be passed to the callback, while the new code passes null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object to be passed to the callback, while the new code passes undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object to be passed to the callback, while the new code passes a new error object.

DONE.
