  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `pop` removes the last element. This change would cause the `laterQueue` to be processed in a different order, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
