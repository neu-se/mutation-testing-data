  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the code would behave differently if `busy` is `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always evaluate to `false` if `busy` is `true`, so the code would behave differently if `busy` is `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always evaluate to `true` if `busy` is `true`, so the code would behave differently if `busy` is `true` or `false`.

DONE.
