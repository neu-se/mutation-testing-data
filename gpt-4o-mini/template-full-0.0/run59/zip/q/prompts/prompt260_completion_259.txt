Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because invoking `resolve` with `null` would fulfill the promise with a non-thenable value, but it may not be the intended resolution value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise consumers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because invoking `resolve` with `undefined` would also fulfill the promise, but it may lead to confusion as `undefined` is often treated as a lack of value, which could cause issues in promise chains that expect a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because invoking `resolve` with a string like `"error"` would fulfill the promise with a string value, which is a valid non-thenable, but it may mislead consumers of the promise into thinking that an error occurred, when in fact it was a successful resolution with a string.

DONE.
