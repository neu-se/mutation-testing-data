  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not logging anything to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(res1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not logging the value of `res1` to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(gettype(link, page));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not logging the result of the `gettype` function to the console.

DONE.
