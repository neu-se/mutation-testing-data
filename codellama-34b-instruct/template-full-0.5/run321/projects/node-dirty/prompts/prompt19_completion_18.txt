  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new empty array, even if the key already exists in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the array, which could cause issues if the array is modified later on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array that is the concatenation of the existing array and the new callback function, which could cause issues if the array is modified later on.

DONE.
