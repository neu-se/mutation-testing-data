  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the truthiness of `cb`. If `cb` is a function, it would be considered truthy and therefore negated, resulting in a falsey value. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to false, even if the callback is defined and should be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which would check if both `cb` and `false` are truthy. If `cb` is a function, it would be considered truthy and therefore would be evaluated to `false`. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to false, even if the callback is defined and should be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?`
