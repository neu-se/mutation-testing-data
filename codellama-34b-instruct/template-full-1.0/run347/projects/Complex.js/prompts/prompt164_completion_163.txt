  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether either this or z is infinite, while this mutated version checks whether neither this nor z is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether either this or z is infinite, while this mutated version checks whether both this and z are finite and z is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether either this or z is infinite, while this mutated version checks whether this is not infinite and z is zero.

DONE.
