  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an empty string, which would be replaced with a single space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an empty string, which would be replaced with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an empty string, which would be replaced with an undefined value.

DONE.
