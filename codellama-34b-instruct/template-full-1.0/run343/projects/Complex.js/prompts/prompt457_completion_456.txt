  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']() && this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` and `isFinite` are Two separate methods that are used to check whether a value is Not a Number or whether it is finite, respectively. In the original code, the PLACEHOLDER checks whether the current object is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, which is done by checking -`isInfinite` whereas in this altered code fragment, the PLACEHOLDER checks if an object is not a number and not finite, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this != this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the PLACEHOLDER checks whether the current object is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas in this altered code fragment, it checks for a condition other than (not equal to) the PLACEHOLDER, which results in a different behavior.
