  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would invoke `array_slice` with a `this` value of `undefined`, which would likely cause an error in non-strict mode or return an empty array in strict mode.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would invoke `slice` with a `this` value of `Array.prototype`, which would not have the same effect as calling `array_slice` with a `this` value of `array_slice` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would invoke `array_slice` with a `this` value of `undefined`, which would likely cause an error in non-strict mode or
