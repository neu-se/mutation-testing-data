  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves').toUpperCase()

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.replace` would replace the entire word with "ves", while the new code fragment would replace the ending "ves" with "ves" and convert the entire word to uppercase, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves').split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.replace` would replace the entire word with "ves", while the new code fragment would replace the ending
