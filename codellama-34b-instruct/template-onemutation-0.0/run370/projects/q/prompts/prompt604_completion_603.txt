  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value. Using `deferred.reject` instead of `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be rejected, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
