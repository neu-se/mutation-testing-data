  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to concatenate the stack traces of `promise` and `error` with an incorrect `stackCounter` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter - 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to concatenate the stack traces of `promise` and `error` with an incorrect `stackCounter` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter * 2, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property would be multiplied by 2, which would
