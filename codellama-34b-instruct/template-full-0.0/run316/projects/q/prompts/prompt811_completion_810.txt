  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `then` method would not be called on the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `then` method would not be called on the returned value. Additionally, passing `null` as the first argument would cause the function to be called with `this` set to `null`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but it does not return a promise, so the `then` method
