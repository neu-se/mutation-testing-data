  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different operation than "get".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a different operation than "get".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is a different operation than "get".

DONE.
