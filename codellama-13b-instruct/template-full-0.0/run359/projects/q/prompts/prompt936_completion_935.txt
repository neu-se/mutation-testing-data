  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of arguments, while the new code fragment returns an empty array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the arguments being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of arguments, while the new code fragment returns the first argument. This could cause issues if the code relies on the arguments being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of arguments, while the new code fragment returns undefined. This could cause issues if the code relies on the arguments being present.

DONE.
