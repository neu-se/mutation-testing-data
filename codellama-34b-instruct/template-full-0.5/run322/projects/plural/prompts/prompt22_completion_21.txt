  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|sausage/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "sausage" is not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the test to fail if it is not properly accounted for in the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|(chicken|duck|goose|turkey)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the words "chicken," "duck," "goose," and "turkey" are not included in the original code fragment, which would cause the test to fail if it is not properly accounted for in the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|(
