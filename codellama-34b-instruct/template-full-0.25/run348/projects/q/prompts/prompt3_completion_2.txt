  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"buggy"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "buggy" is not a valid promise state, and would cause an error if used in place of the original "promise" string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value is not a valid promise state, and would cause an error if used in place of the original "promise" string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value is not a valid promise state, and would cause an error if used in place of the original "promise" string.

DONE.
