  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a constant value that would never satisfy the condition of `isPromise(promise)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that would always resolve to `true`, regardless of the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a constant value that would never satisfy the condition of `isPromise(promise)`.

DONE.
