Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of the callback to `true`, which may not be the intended behavior, as the original code passes `null` as the second argument when there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `data` variable as the second argument to the callback instead of `null`, which could lead to unexpected results if the caller is not prepared to handle the data in the case of an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the positions of the arguments, passing `null` as the first argument and the error as the second, which is contrary to the standard Node.js callback pattern where the first argument is reserved for the error.

DONE.
