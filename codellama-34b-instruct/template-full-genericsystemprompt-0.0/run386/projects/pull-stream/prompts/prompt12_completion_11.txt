  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
