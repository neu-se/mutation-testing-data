  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different argument, `null`, instead of the original argument, `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different argument, `generate()`, instead of the original argument, `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different argument, `generate() + 1`, instead of the original argument, `end`.

DONE.
