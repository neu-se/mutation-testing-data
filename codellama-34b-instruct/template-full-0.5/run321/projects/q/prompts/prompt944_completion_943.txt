  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns the value "undefined". In contrast, the new code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns the value "null".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(function(){});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns the value "undefined". In contrast, the new code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns the value "undefined" (because the function has no return statement).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(function(err){});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns the value "undefined". In contrast, the new code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns the value "
