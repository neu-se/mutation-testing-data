  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` instead of `data`, which could be a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the same value for both `null` and `undefined`, which could be a different value than the original code.

DONE.
