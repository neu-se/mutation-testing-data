  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is equal to 0, rather than the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to 0, rather than equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is equal to 0, rather than checking if the imaginary part is equal to 0.

DONE.
