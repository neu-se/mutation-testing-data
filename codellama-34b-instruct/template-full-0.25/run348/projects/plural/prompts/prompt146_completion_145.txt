  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` would be a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a function, and `rule[1]` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[3]` is a function, and `rule[1]` is a string.

DONE.
