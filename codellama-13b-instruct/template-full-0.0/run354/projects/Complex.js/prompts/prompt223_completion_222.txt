  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the magnitude of the complex number using the Pythagorean theorem, whereas the original code fragment uses the `hypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the magnitude of the complex number using the absolute value of the real and imaginary parts, whereas the original code fragment uses the `hypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(Math.abs(a), Math.abs(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the magnitude of the complex number using the maximum of the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts, whereas the original code fragment uses the `hypot` function.

DONE.
