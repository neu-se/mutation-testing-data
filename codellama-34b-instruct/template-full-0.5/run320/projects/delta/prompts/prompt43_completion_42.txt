  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `0` character as a placeholder, but the new code fragment uses the `1` character as a placeholder. This could cause issues if the code is relying on the specific value of the placeholder character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `0` character as a placeholder, but the new code fragment uses a space character as a placeholder. This could cause issues if the code is relying on the specific value of the placeholder character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `0` character as a placeholder, but the new code fragment uses the string `"foo"` as a placeholder. This could cause issues if the code is relying on the specific value of the placeholder character.

DONE.
