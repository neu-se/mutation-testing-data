  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not check if the last operation is an object, and would always insert the new operation at the end of the array, regardless of whether the last operation is an object or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would check if the last operation is null, and would not insert the new operation if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would check if the last operation's `insert` property is undefined, and would not insert the new operation if it is undefined.

DONE.
