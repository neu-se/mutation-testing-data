  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would return the opposite of `isEqual`, which means that the code would behave differently for equal and non-equal values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is a non-standard function that is not defined in the code snippet, and would likely cause an error if used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isDifferent
```
This would result in different behavior because `isDifferent` is a non-standard function that is not defined in the code snippet, and would likely cause an error if used.

DONE.
