 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will not pass the correct `this` context to the `next` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>new OpIterator(slice.ops)).next
```
This would result in different behavior because it will bypass type checking and may cause unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will explicitly set the `this` context to `null`, which is not the intended behavior and may cause issues.

DONE.
