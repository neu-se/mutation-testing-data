  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and would retain the text instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and would insert text instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain(Op.length(op))` would retain the entire length of the operation, instead of just the `op.delete` operation.

DONE.
