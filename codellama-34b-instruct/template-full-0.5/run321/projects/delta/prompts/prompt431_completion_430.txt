  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length === 0` is always false, whereas `!length` is always true if `length` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length !== 0` is always true, whereas `!length` is always false if `length` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length < 0` is always false, whereas `!length` is always true if `length` is a number.

DONE.
