 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '-') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign would be incorrectly calculated for the real part of the complex number when the input string contains a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number would be multiplied by 2 when the input string contains a positive number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '+') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign would be incorrectly calculated for the real part of the complex number when the input string contains a negative number. Additionally, the calculation would be incorrect for positive numbers as well, as they would always have a positive sign.

DONE.
