  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being used instead of the `cos` function, which would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being used instead of the `sin` function, which would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅(cosθ + sinθ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosθ + sinθ` term is being added to the calculation of `sinφ2`, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE
