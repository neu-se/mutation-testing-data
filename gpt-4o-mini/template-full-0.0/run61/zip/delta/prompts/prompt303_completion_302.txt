Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the loop to process the same operation multiple times instead of moving forward.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `iter.next(2)` attempts to advance the iterator by two operations at once, which may lead to skipping over operations and not processing them correctly, especially if there are fewer than two operations left.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `iter.next(0)` effectively does nothing and does not advance the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop if the condition to exit the loop is based on the iterator's state.

DONE.
