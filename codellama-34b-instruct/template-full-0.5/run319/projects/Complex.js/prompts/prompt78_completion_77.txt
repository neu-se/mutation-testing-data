  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop one iteration earlier, potentially skipping the last token.

DONE.
