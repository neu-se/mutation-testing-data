  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `-b` returns the negative value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `a` returns the value of the variable `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `a + b` returns the sum of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
