Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^[a-z]$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string starts with a lowercase letter instead of a non-digit character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sw === sw.toUpperCase
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string is equal to its uppercase version instead of checking if it's a non-digit character, potentially leading to incorrect prefixing of switches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.boolean.includes(sw)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the switch is a boolean option instead of checking if it's a non-digit character, potentially leading to incorrect prefixing of switches.

DONE.
