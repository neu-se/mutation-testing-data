  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values()).filter(x => x.type === 'internal')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.from` to convert the `urlMap.values()` iterator into an array, while this code fragment uses `Array.from` with a filter function to only include values with a `type` property equal to `'internal'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values(), x => x.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.from` to convert the `urlMap.values()` iterator into an array, while this code fragment uses `Array.from` with a mapping function to only include the `url` property of each value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values(), () => 'internal')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.
