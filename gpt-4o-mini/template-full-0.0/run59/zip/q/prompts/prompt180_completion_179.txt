Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(browser.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify stack frames from a different environment (browser) instead of the intended Node.js environment, potentially leading to misleading stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match stack lines that do not include line numbers, which could lead to incorrect parsing of stack traces and loss of valuable debugging information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(nodejs:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different string format that does not match the expected format of Node.js stack traces, causing the function to fail to identify relevant stack frames.

DONE.
