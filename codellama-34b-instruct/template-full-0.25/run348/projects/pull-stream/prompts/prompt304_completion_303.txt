  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with the correct arguments. The `cb` function is expected to be called with two arguments: `err` and `data`. By replacing it with `cb(null, data)`, we are calling the `cb` function with only one argument, which could cause issues if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was not called with the correct arguments. The `cb` function is expected to be called with two arguments: `err` and `data`. By replacing it with `cb(err, null)`, we are calling the `cb` function with the arguments in the opposite order, which could cause issues if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
