  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a valid array as its second argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a valid array as its second argument, and passing `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a valid array as its second argument, and passing an empty array would result in an empty array being returned, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
