  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern `\/index\.[a-z]*$` matches any sequence of alphabetical characters following `.index.`, instead of only the first alphabetic character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+\//, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern `\/index\.[a-z]+/` matches any sequence of alphabetical
