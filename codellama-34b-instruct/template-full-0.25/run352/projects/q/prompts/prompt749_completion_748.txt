  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the resolved promise instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise object instead of the resolved value.

DONE.
