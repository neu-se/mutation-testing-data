  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* this.ops.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the op to the end of the array, rather than the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* this.ops.unshift(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the op to the beginning of the array, rather than the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* this.ops.splice(0, 0, thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the op at the beginning of the array, rather than adding it to the end.

DONE.
