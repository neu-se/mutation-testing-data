  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and it would change the way the `stringify` function behaves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is not the same as `options`, and it would change the way the `JSON.parse` function behaves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is not the same as `options`, and it would change the way the `JSON.parse` function behaves.

DONE.
