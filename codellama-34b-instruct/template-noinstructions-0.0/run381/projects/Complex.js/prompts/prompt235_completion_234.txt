  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, which is not the same as the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts, which is not the same as the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the hypotenuse of the real and imaginary parts, which is not the same as the absolute value of the complex number.

DONE.
