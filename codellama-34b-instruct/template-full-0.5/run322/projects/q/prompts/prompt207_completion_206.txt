  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("deprecated");
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` is a function that displays a warning message on the console, but it does not return a value that can be used in a conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("deprecated");
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that displays a message on the console, but it does not return a value that can be used in a conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn === "function" && console.warn("deprecated");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `console.warn` is a function and if it is, it would display a warning message on the console.

DONE.
