 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'id'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the country with the id equal to the timezone name, instead of the correct country for the timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a country instead of the correct country for the timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the id provided in the options object, instead of the correct country for the timezone. This could lead to unexpected results or errors if the provided id is invalid or does not match any country.

DONE.
