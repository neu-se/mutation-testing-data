  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is incorrect, so the callback will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('test')
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is correct, but the error object is different, so the callback will be called with a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name and number of arguments are correct, but the value of the load event will be different, so the callback will be called with a different value.

DONE.
