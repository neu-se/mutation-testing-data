  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `0 !== 0` whereas `isInfinite` should return `true` when `this['re']` is not a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `0 === 0` whereas `isInfinite` should return `false` when `this['re']` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `0 !== 0` whereas `isInfinite` should return `false` when `this['im']` is not a finite number.

DONE.
