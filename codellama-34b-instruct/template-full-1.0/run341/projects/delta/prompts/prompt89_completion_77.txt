  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because even if the `attributes` property is an object, the `typeof` operator would return `'object'` instead of `'undefined'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for strict equality, and `null` is not strictly equal to any object, including `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for loose equality, and `null` is loosely equal to any object, including `undefined`.

DONE.
