  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next element, potentially skipping over the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward to the previous element, potentially skipping over the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.current()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to remain on the current element, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely.

DONE.
