 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the second component of the complex number, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when b is 0, which is not handled in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the result, making it unpredictable and inconsistent.

DONE.
