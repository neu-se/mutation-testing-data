  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` returns an array of the values in the object, while `object_keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` is a method that returns an array of the values in the object, while `object_keys` is a method that returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` is a method that returns an array of the keys in the object, while `object_values` returns an array of the values in the object.

DONE.
