 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the filename has no extension, instead of checking if it has an extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(options.dest.includes('.'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the dest string does not contain a dot, instead of checking if the filename has an extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('.').length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the dest string does not contain any dots, instead of checking if the filename has an extension.

DONE.
