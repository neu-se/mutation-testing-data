 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.push(new Op('retain', { length: op.retain }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a new `Op` object with `'retain'` type and `{ length: op.retain }` attributes, instead of just retaining the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.retain(op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly passes `op.retain` to the `retain` method, which might not be the expected behavior if `op.retain` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.retain(op.retain, op.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `op.attributes` to the `retain` method, which might not be the intended behavior if `op.attributes` should be transformed or inverted
