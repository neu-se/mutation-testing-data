  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a new error object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error, rather than the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(Q(x).join(y))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would be called with the result of `x.join(y)`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of that function, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(Q(x).join(y).then(function (result) {
    return result;
}))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` function would be called with a function that returns the result of `Q(x).join(y)`, which would
