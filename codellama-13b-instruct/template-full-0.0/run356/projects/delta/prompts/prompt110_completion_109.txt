  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `op` object is being accessed instead of the `delete` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `op` object is being accessed instead of the `retain` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `op` object is being accessed instead of the `insert` method.

DONE.
