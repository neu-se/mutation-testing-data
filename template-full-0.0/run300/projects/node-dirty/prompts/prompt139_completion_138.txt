  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `cbs` array is empty and if `err` is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the `cbs` array has at least one element and if `err` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length && err == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `cbs` array is empty and if `err` is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the `cbs` array is empty and if `err` is null.
