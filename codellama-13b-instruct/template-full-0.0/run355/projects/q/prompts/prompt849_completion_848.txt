  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    makeStackTraceLong(error, promise);
    if (Q.onerror) {
        Q.onerror(error);
    } else {
        throw error;
    }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error to be thrown asynchronously, rather than immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    makeStackTraceLong(error, promise);
    if (Q.onerror) {
        Q.onerror(error);
    } else {
        throw error;
    }
});
```
