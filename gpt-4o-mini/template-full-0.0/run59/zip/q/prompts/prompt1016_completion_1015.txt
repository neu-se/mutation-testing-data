Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a boolean `true` to the `makeNodeResolver` function, which may not be expected and could lead to incorrect handling of the callback, potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `makeNodeResolver` could lead to a situation where the callback is not properly defined, resulting in the promise not being resolved or rejected as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `makeNodeResolver` may cause the function to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections or incorrect callback execution.

DONE.
