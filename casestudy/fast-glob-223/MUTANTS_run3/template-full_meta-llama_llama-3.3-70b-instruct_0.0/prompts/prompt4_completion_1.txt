Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the uppercase version of the pattern is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the pattern contains case-sensitive glob characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.replace(GLOBSTAR, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the pattern with all globstar characters removed is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the pattern relies on the globstar for its glob behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the pattern with an additional wildcard character appended is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the pattern is already a glob or if the additional wildcard character changes its behavior.

DONE.
