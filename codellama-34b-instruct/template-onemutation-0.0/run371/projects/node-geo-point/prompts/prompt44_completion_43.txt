  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(r)` returns a value between -1 and 1, while `acos(r)` returns a value between 0 and Ï€. This change would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this method.

DONE.
