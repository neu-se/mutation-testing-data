 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is the same as `sinh`, but it's more explicit and less prone to errors due to potential name collisions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-sinh
