 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is being called with only one argument, while in the original code it is called with two arguments (end and data). This could cause issues if the test suite expects `cb` to be called with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, cb)
