  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a keyword referring to the current object, and the original code fragment is referring to the variable `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that evaluates to `falsy`, and the original code fragment is checking for the existence of a property on `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and the original code fragment is checking for the existence of a property on `this`.

DONE.
