  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved after the specified delay, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred object, whereas `Q` returns a promise.

DONE.
