  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the object being accessed in the `Object.keys()` call, which would cause the `embedType` variable to be set to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys()` call to throw an error, as `null` is not an object and does not have properties that can be accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Object.keys()` call to return an empty array, which would cause the `embedType` variable to be set to `undefined`.

DONE.
