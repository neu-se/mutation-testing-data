  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the original `b` and `a` values, while `b - a` returns the difference between `b` and `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the original `b` and `a` values, while `a - b` returns the difference between `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` returns the original `b` and `a` values, while `b * a` returns the product of `b` and `a`.

DONE.
