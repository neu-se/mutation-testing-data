  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function would round the value of `θ` down to the nearest integer, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function would round the value of `θ` up to the nearest integer, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.round` function would round the value of `θ` to the nearest integer, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
