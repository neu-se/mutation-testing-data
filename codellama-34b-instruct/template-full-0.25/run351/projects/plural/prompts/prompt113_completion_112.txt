  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(["shirt"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the word "clothes," while this new code fragment includes the word "shirt" as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(["shoes"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the word "clothes," while this new code fragment includes the word "shoes" as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(["pants"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the word "clothes," while this new code fragment includes the word "pants" as well.

DONE.
