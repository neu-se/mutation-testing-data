  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary plus operator would be used instead of the unary minus operator, which would cause the sign of the imaginary part to be flipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 1 would be added to the imaginary part, which would cause the imaginary part to be shifted by 1 unit in the direction of the real axis.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the imaginary part to be scaled by a factor of 2.

DONE.
