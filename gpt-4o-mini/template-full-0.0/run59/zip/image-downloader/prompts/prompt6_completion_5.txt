Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Destination is not provided')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, which may not be caught by tests that expect the original message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.url is required'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly indicates that the `url` option is missing instead of the `dest` option, potentially leading to confusion in error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve('No destination provided')
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a string instead of rejecting it with an error, which changes the expected flow of the function and may lead to unhandled promise states.

DONE.
