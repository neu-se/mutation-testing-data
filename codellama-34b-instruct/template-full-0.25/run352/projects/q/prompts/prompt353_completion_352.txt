  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `null` instead of the original exception, which could cause the promise chain to resolve instead of reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with a different error message, which could cause the promise chain to reject with a different error than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called at all, and the promise chain would reject with a different error message than expected.

DONE.
