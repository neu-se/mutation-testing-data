  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is greater than the length of the array, which is not the same as checking if the index is in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is less than the length of the array, which is not the same as checking if the index is in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is not equal to the length of the array, which is not the same as checking if the index is in the array.

DONE.
