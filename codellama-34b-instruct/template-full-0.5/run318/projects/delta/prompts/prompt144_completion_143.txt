  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first `start - index` elements of the `this.ops` array, rather than iterating over them as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(end - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first `end - index` elements of the `other.ops` array, rather than iterating over them as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first `end - index` elements of the `iter` array, rather than iterating over them as the original code does.

DONE.
