  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different country ID to the `getCountry` function, which would likely return a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.countryId, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `countryId` property of the `options` object as the country ID, rather than the `countryId` parameter passed to the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId).id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `id` property of the country object returned by the `getCountry` function, rather than the `countryId` parameter passed to the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

DONE.
