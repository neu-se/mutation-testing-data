  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, whereas the original code uses `this` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the `this` context of the function, whereas the original code uses `this` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` changes the `this` context and arguments of the function, whereas the original code uses `this` directly.

DONE.
