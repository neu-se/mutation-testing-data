 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy node resolver'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error would prevent the successful resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
