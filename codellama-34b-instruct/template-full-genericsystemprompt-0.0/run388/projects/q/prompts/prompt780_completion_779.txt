  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` would return a promise for the state of the promise, rather than the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop)` would return a promise for the resolution of the promise, rather than the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return value; }, function (reason) { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(function (value) { return value; }, function (reason) { throw reason; })` would return a promise for the resolution of the promise, rather than the value of the promise.

DONE.
