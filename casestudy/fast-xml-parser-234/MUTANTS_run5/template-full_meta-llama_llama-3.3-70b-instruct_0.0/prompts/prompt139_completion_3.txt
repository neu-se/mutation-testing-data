Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-zA-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any trailing letters instead of leading zeros after a decimal point, potentially altering the numeric value being parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\d+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all trailing digits instead of leading zeros after a decimal point, which could significantly alter the numeric value being parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^0-9.]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any non-numeric character (except for the decimal point) at the end of the string, which could lead to incorrect parsing if the string contains such characters.

DONE.
