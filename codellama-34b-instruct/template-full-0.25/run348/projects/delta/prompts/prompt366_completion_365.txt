  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekType()` is a function call, while `thisIter.peekType` is a property access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` is a function call, while `thisIter.peekType` is a property access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekType + 1` is a mathematical expression, while `thisIter.peekType` is a property access.

DONE.
