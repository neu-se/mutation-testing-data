  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `rest()` method to start from the next index instead of the current one, potentially skipping over some operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `rest()` method to start from the previous index instead of the current one, potentially including operations that were already processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops.length` would cause the `rest()` method to start from the end of the `ops` array instead of the current index, potentially including operations that were already processed.

DONE.
