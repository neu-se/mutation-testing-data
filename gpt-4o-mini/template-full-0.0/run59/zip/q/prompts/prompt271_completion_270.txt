Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `notify` function to proceed if `resolvedPromise` is explicitly set to `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code that checks for a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `notify` function to execute if `resolvedPromise` is falsy (including `undefined` or `0`), potentially leading to notifications being sent when they shouldn't be, as opposed to the original check which only allows notifications when `resolvedPromise` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only prevent the `notify` function from executing if `resolvedPromise` is specifically `undefined`, ignoring other falsy values like `null` or `false`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in promise resolution.

DONE.
