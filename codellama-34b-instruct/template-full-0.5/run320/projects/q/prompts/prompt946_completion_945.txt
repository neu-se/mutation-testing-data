  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that takes a value and resolves the promise with that value, whereas `null` is not a function and would cause an error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that takes a value and resolves the promise with that value, whereas `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that takes a value and resolves the promise with that value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that takes a reason and rejects the promise with that reason.

DONE.
