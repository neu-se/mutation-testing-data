Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would throw an error since `arguments` is not an array and does not have a `slice` method, unlike `array_slice`, which is presumably a custom function that correctly handles the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` would only return the second argument passed to the function, instead of an array of all arguments starting from the second one, which would lead to incorrect behavior when multiple arguments are expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from(arguments).slice(1)` creates a new array from the `arguments` object and then slices it, which may introduce unnecessary overhead and could behave differently if the `arguments` object is modified after the conversion, unlike `array_slice` which may have specific handling for the arguments.

DONE.
