  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `key` and `value` variables, while the buggy code fragment is using the `key` and `value` constants. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `key` and `value` variables are not defined or have different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `key` and `value` variables, while the buggy code fragment is using the `key` and `value` constants.
