  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w*2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the outcome to be twice the original input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w+"s" }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the letter 's' to the end of the input, making the output different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length-2) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two characters of the input, making the output different from the original.

DONE.
