  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[options[id]], options
```
This would result in different behavior because the index argument of the `getCountry` function is being extracted from the `options` object instead of the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] || options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function now returns the `options` object if the `countries` object does not have a property with the specified `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] + options[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function now returns the concatenation of the `countries` object's property with the same `id` and the `options` object's property with the same `id`.

DONE.
