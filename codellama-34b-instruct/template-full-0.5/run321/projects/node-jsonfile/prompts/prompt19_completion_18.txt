  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + ".json"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `file` variable as an argument to `fs.readFileSync`, which is a function that reads the contents of a file. By adding ".json" to the end of the `file` variable, we are effectively changing the file that is being read, which could result in different behavior if the file contents are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace(/(\.json)$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `file` variable as an argument to `fs.readFileSync`, which is a function that reads the contents of a file. By using the `replace` method to remove the ".json" extension from the `file` variable, we are effectively changing the file that is being read, which could result in different behavior if the file contents are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.substring(
