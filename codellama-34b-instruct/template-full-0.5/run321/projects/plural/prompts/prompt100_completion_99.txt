  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the letter "e" as a string, while this new code fragment returns the number 1, which is the ASCII code for the letter "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e'.charCodeAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the letter "e" as a string, while this new code fragment returns the ASCII code for the letter "e", which is 101.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e'.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the letter "e" as a string, while this new code fragment returns the lowercase version of the letter "e", which is "e".

DONE.
