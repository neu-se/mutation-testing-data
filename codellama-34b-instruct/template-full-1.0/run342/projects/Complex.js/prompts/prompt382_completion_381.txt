  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is not equal to `a` when `a` is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - 1` is not equal to `a` when `a` is not equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * a` is not equal to `a` when `a` is not equal to zero.

DONE.
