  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be twice as large as the original code, which could result in a different value for the `d` variable and potentially different behavior in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than the product of `a` and `b`, which could result in a different value for the `d` variable and potentially different behavior in the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be the difference of `a` and `b`, rather than the product of `a` and `b`, which could result in a different value for the `d` variable and potentially different behavior in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
