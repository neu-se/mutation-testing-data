  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `temp` as is, while the modified code fragment adds 1 to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `temp` as is, while the modified code fragment subtracts 1 from it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `temp` as is, while the modified code fragment multiplies it by 2.

DONE.
