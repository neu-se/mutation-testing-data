  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to the function instead of the first, which could cause unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive no arguments instead of the expected first argument, which could cause errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive a null argument instead of the expected first argument, which could cause errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
