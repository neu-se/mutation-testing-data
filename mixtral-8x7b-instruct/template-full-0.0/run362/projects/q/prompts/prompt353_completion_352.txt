 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Buggy error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original exception object with a new error object, which might not have the same stack trace or properties as the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the exception object with an empty object, which is not an error and would not be handled correctly by the error-handling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the exception object with null, which is not an error and would not be handled correctly by the error-handling code.

DONE.
