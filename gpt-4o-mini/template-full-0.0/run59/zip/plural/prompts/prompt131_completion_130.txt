Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].test(word + 's')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tests the word with an appended 's', which would incorrectly match plural forms instead of the original word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && !rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the test condition, causing the rule to be applied even when the word does not match the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality instead of equality, meaning that the rule would be applied even if the word matches the string exactly.

DONE.
