Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` changes the first argument passed to the `dispatch` method, which may affect how the method interprets the context or the binding of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which may lead to incorrect handling of the parameters in the `dispatch` method, potentially causing it to misinterpret the intended function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of `args` means that no arguments will be sent to the function being dispatched, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the function expects arguments.

DONE.
