Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to proceed without throwing an error when `b` is a valid object, which contradicts the original intent of ensuring `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an error if `b` is an array, allowing other object types to pass through without error, which is not the intended validation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an error if `b` is a string, thus incorrectly allowing other types of objects to be retained without raising an error, which deviates from the original validation logic.

DONE.
