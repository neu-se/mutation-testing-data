  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in division by zero, causing the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would cause the program to throw a null pointer exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would cause the program to throw a type error, as the function is expecting a numerical value and receiving a string.

DONE.
