  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different function than `reject`, and it would change the outcome of the `Q.race` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a different function than `reject`, and it would change the outcome of the `Q.race` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not have the same effect as `reject`, and it would change the outcome of the `Q.race` method.

DONE.
