  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 РаChange the operator from cos to sin
```
This would result in different behavior because sin() and cos() have different outputs for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
измените число PI на рандомное значение
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle of the destination point would change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
將θ替換為其他角度（例如90度）
```
This would result in different behavior because the output of calculateDestination would be different with other angles.

DONE.
