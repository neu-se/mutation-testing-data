  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `object`, and would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the original result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the `value` property of the `object`, which might not exist or have a different value than the original result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the item at index `0` of the `object`, which might not exist or have a different value than the original result.

DONE.
