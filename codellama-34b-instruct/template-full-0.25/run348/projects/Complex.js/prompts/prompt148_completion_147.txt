  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isInfinite']()` would always return `false`, even if `z` is infinite, because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isZero']()` would always return `true`, even if `z` is not zero, because the `isZero` method is not defined on the `Complex` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re'] === 0` would always return `false`, even if `z` is real and equal to zero, because the `re` property is not defined on the `Complex` class.

DONE.
