  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` while this code decrements it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` while this code always returns `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` while this code always returns `i + 1`.

DONE.
