Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially allowing file operations on directories.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.canWrite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node has write permissions instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially preventing read-only operations on directories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.canExecute()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node has execute permissions instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially preventing operations that require directory status.

DONE.
