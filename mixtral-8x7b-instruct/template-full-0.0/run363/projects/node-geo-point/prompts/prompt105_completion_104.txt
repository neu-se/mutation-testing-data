 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 180 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is scaled incorrectly, which can cause issues in determining the correct tile for a given coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(coordinate.latitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is used instead of the longitude value, causing incorrect tile calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(coordinate.longitude + 180) * Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula uses a different base for the exponent, which can lead to incorrect tile calculations.

DONE.
