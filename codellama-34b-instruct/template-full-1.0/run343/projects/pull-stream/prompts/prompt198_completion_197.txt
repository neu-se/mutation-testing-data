  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with the `abort` argument, while this replacement code fragment calls `cb` with both the `abort` argument and the string `'aborted'`. This would cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently than expected when it is called with an `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `cb` with the `abort` argument, while this replacement code fragment calls `cb` with a different argument (specifically, the `abort` argument). This would cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently than expected when it is called with an `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not
