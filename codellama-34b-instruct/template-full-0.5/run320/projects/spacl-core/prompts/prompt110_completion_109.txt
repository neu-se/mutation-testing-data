  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb = 'allow'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allow` verb would be assigned to the `verb` variable, even if the `deny` verb was passed as an argument to the `allow` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb = 'deny'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deny` verb would be assigned to the `verb` variable, even if the `allow` verb was passed as an argument to the `deny` method.

DONE.
