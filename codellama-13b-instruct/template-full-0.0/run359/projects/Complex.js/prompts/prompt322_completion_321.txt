  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a`, while the new code fragment calculates the square of `a` times `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `b`, while the new code fragment calculates the square of `b` times `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the product of `a` and `b`, while the new code fragment calculates the product of `a` times `b`.

DONE.
