  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties of the `object` are `undefined`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== object.longitude
```
This code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties of the `object` are not equal, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === object.longitude
```
This code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties of the `object` are equal, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
