  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify()` method to be called with `null` as the argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify()` method to be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify()` method to be called with the string "<PLACEHOLDER>" as the argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
