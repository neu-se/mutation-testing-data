  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is called on the `part` variable, which is a string, and the regular expression pattern is not correctly escaped. This would cause the `replace` method to fail and the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1').toUpperCase())
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1').split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
