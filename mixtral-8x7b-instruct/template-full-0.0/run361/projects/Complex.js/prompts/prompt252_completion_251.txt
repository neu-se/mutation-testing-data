 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `cosm1` function is not used, and the argument passed to `Math.cos` is only the imaginary part of the complex number, not the full complex number. This change would not account for the real part and the interaction between the real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(this['im'] - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `Math.cos` is the imaginary part minus one, instead of just the imaginary part. This change would not provide the correct result for the complex exponent minus one, as it does not account for the original formula's interaction between the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(this['re']) * Math.cos(this['im']) - 1
```
This would result
