 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to Infinity, instead of checking if the value is Infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, causing the multiplication to always return Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number is zero, which is not the same as checking if it's infinite.

DONE.
