  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex.INFINITY`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex.NAN`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex.INFINITY` if `a` is 0, regardless of the value of `b`.

DONE.
