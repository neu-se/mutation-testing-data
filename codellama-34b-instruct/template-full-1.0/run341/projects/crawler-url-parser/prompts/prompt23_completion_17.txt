  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly prepend "http://" to URLs that start with "//", when it should only prepend it to URLs that start with a scheme like "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/\/\/$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly remove the last occurrence of "//" in a URL, when it should only remove it if it appears at the beginning of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^http:/, 'https:');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly convert "http://" to "https://" at the beginning of a URL, when it should only do so if the URL is not a local path.

DONE.
