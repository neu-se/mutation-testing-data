 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `const` instead of `<PLACEHOLDER>` which uses `in` without declaring the iteration variable. This change would cause the compiler to throw an error, but if it didn't, it would result in `key` always being set to the last key of `a`, instead of iterating over all keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (let key of Object.keys(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `let` and `of` instead of `in`. This change would cause the code to iterate over the keys as an array, which would result in different behavior when the key doesn't exist in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const key in Object.keys(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior
