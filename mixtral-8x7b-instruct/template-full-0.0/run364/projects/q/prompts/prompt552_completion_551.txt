 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately resolves the promise with the value, instead of waiting for the next `yield` statement in the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Q` constructor instead of the `when` function, which could lead to different error handling or behavior depending on the implementation of the `Q` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise(function (resolve) { resolve(result.value) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise using the ES6 `Promise` constructor, which again could lead to different error handling or behavior depending on the implementation of the `Promise` constructor.

DONE.
