  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.apply(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array as its second argument, whereas `mapper` expects a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a single value as its second argument, whereas `mapper` expects an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper[data]
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper[data]` would return the value of the property with the name `data` in the `mapper` object, whereas `mapper(data)` would call the `mapper` function with `data` as its argument.

DONE.
