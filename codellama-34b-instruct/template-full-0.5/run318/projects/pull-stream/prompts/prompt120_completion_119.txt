  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
