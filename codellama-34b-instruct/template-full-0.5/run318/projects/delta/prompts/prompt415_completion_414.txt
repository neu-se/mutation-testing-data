  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the current operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` advances the iterator to the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the current operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns the type of the current operation, and `peekType === 'retain'` would only return `true` if the current operation is a retain operation.

DONE.
