Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly modifies the `ops` array of `delta` instead of using the `push` method, which may lead to inconsistencies in the `Delta` object's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes an operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which would incorrectly combine operations from the wrong source, potentially altering the intended composition of the `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to push a `null` value into the `delta`, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when processing the `Delta` object, as it would not represent a valid operation.

DONE.
