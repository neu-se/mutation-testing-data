  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `promise.then()`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `null` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `promise.then()`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message instead of being fulfilled with the original value.

DONE.
