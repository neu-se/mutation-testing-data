  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected one, causing the `rejected` callback to be skipped and the `fulfilled` callback to be called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive an undefined value instead of a promise, causing the `rejected` callback to be called with the undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a null value instead of a promise, causing the `rejected` callback to be called with the null value.

DONE.
