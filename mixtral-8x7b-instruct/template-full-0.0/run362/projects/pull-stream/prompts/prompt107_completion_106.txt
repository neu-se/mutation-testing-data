 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, done
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of immediately calling the `drain` function, it would pass `false` as the first argument, which might cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, function() { done() }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of directly calling the `done` function, it would wrap it in an anonymous function, which could cause issues if the `drain` function or the test suite expects the `done` function to have a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, done
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing `null` as the first argument to the `drain` function, it would pass a number, which might cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

DONE.
