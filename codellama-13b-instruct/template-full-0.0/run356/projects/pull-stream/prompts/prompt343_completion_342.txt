  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort()` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment simply refers to the `abort` variable. This could cause the callback function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is being used in a different way than in the original code fragment. This could cause the callback function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is being used in a different way than in the original code fragment. This could cause the callback function to be called with a different value than expected.

DONE.
