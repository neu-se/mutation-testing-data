  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return defer() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original `defer` function.

DONE.
