  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string, while the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method returns a new string, while the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a new string, while the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
