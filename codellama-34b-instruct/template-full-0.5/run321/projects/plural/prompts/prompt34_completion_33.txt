  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the last character, while the new code fragment is using a hardcoded index of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the last character, while the new code fragment is using a hardcoded index of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the last character, while the new code fragment is using a hardcoded index of -1.

DONE.
