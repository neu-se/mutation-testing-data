  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a different URL than the one specified in the `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a URL with a different protocol than the one specified in the `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a URL without a protocol or subdomain, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
