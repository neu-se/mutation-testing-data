Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(2 / zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calculates the tile x-coordinate by dividing 2 by the zoom level instead of raising 2 to the power of the zoom level, leading to incorrect tile positioning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(3, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses 3 instead of 2 as the base for the power calculation, which would yield a completely different number of tiles at each zoom level, resulting in incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the exponential function instead of the power function, which would produce a rapidly increasing value that does not correspond to the expected number of tiles at a given zoom level, leading to incorrect calculations for tile coordinates.

DONE.
