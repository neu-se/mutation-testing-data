Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || true === op(data) && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operators and the order of evaluation, potentially allowing the `abort` condition to be evaluated incorrectly, leading to unintended execution paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the `op` check, meaning that if `op` is falsy, the condition will always evaluate to true, causing the `abort` to be triggered regardless of the actual data processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true === op(data) && !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a negation on `abort`, which means that the condition will only pass if `abort` is false, potentially allowing data to be processed even when it should not be.

DONE.
