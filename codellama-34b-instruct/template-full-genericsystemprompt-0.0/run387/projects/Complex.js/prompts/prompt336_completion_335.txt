  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to 1, but replacing it with 0 would cause the condition to always be false, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to 1, but replacing it with -1 would cause the condition to always be true, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to 1, but replacing it with `a + 1` would cause the condition to be true if `a` is greater than 1, resulting in a different outcome.

DONE.
