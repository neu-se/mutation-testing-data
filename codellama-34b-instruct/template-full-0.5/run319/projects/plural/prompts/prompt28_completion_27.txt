  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting from the second-to-last character of the word, instead of the third-to-last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting from the fourth-to-last character of the word, instead of the third-to-last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting from the sixth-to-last character of the word, instead of the third-to-last character.

DONE.
