 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return true for all non-unique items, instead of only returning true for the second occurrence of a non-unique item.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toString(), true
