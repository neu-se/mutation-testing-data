 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word instead of the last two characters when checking for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append 'es' to the end of the word, regardless of the pattern, when checking for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].test(word) ? 'yes' : 'no'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'yes' or 'no' instead of applying the appropriate pluralization rule when checking for a matching rule.

DONE.
