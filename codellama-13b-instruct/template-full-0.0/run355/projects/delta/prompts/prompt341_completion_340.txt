  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the `OpIterator` object, which would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is called on the `OpIterator` object, which would cause the iterator to return the next operation in the slice without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is called on the `OpIterator` object with an argument of `1`, which would cause the iterator to return the next operation in the slice without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
