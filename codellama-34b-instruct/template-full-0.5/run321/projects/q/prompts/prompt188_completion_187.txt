  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third capture group of the regex, which may not exist in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first capture group of the regex, which may not be the same as the second capture group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire match, which may not be the same as the second capture group.

DONE.
