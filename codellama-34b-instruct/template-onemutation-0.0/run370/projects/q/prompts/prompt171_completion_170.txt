  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame(line) && line.indexOf("(node.js:") === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for lines that contain the string `"(node.js:"`, which is not the intended behavior of the function.
