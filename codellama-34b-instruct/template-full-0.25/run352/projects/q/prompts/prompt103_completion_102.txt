  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `this[index]`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `this[index]`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `this[index]`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
