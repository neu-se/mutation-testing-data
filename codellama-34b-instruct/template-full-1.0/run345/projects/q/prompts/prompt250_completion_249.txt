  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"x"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would be longer than a single character, which could potentially cause issues with the stack trace parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would be shorter than a single character, which could potentially cause issues with the stack trace parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"_"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would contain an underscore instead of a newline character, which could potentially cause issues with the stack trace parsing.

DONE.
