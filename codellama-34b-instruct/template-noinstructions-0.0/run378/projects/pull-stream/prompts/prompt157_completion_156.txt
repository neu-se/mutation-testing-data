  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument, `null`, while this replacement calls it with two arguments, `false` and `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument, `null`, while this replacement calls it with two arguments, `null` and `_value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(_value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a single argument, `null`, while this replacement calls it with a single argument, `_value`.

DONE.
