  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

_writeFileSync
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to call the synchronous `writeFileSync` function instead of the asynchronous `_writeFile` function. This will result in the `writeFile` function returning a value instead of a promise, which may cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the `writeFile` function returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileAsync
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to call a non-existent function `_writeFileAsync` instead of the asynchronous `_writeFile` function.
