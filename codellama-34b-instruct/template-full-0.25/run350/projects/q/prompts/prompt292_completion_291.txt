  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with the `progress` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with `undefined` as the argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with `null` as the argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
