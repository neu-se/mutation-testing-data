  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query string on the "=" character, while the new code fragment splits it on the "=" character and the "&" character. This would cause the query count to be calculated differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query string on the "=" character, while the new code fragment splits it on the "&" character. This would cause the query count to be calculated differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("?")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query string on the "=" character, while the new code fragment splits it on the "?" character.
