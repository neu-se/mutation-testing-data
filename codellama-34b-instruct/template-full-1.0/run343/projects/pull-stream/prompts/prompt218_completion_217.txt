  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the error and callback parameters are passed to the map function, but in the modified code, the map function would be called with a null error parameter and the same callback. This could cause the map function to behave differently, such as not returning an error to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the error and callback parameters are passed to the map function, but in the modified code, the map function would be called with the error parameter but a null callback. This could cause the map function to behave differently, such as not calling the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the abort parameter is passed to the read function, but in the modified code, the read function would be called with the abort parameter and a null callback.
