  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (thisIter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `hasNext()` method from the `OpIterator` class to check if there are any more ops to process, while the new code uses the `hasNext()` method from the `Delta` class, which may return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (thisIter.hasNext(<PLACEHOLDER>) || otherIter.hasNext())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `hasNext()` method from the `OpIterator` class to check if there are any more ops to process, while the new code uses the `hasNext()` method from the `Delta` class with a placeholder parameter, which may return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (thisIter.hasNext(otherIter.peek()) || otherIter.hasNext())
