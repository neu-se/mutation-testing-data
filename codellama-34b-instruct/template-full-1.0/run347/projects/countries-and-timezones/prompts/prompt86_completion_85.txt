  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the country ID instead of the country object to the `getCountry` function, which would lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the country name instead of the country object to the `getCountry` function, which would lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[0].id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the ID of the first country in the `c` array instead of the country object, which would lead to a different result.

DONE.
