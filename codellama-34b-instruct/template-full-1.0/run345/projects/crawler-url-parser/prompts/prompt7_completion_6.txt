  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the function to return `null` if `baseUrlStr` is empty or has illegal characters, even if `currentUrlStr` has legal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!baseUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical negation operator `!` is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the function to return `null` if `baseUrlStr` is empty or has illegal characters, regardless of whether `currentUrlStr` has legal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length > 0 && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of
