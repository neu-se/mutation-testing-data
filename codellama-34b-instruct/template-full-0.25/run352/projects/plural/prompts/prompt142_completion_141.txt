  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the rule's first element is a string and if it is equal to the word, while this new code fragment checks if the rule's first element is not equal to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] !== word && type(rule[0]) === 'String'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the rule's first element is a string and if it is equal to the word, while this new code fragment checks if the rule's first element is not equal to the word and if it is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] !== word || type(rule[0]) !== 'String'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the rule's first element is a string and if it is equal to the word, while this new
