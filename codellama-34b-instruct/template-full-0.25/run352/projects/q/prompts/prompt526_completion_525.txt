  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function would receive a `null` value instead of the expected `args` array, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function would receive an empty array instead of the expected `args` array, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function would receive an `undefined` value instead of the expected `args` array, which could cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
