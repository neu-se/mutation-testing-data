  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` would be called immediately after `setImmediate`, rather than after the current task has completed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` would be called as a task, rather than immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` would be added to the `laterQueue`, rather than being called immediately.

DONE.
