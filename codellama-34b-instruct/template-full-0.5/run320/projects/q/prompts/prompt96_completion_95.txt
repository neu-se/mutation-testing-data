  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index <= length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never end if the `length` variable is not updated inside the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < length && this[index] !== value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute if the current element is not equal to the `value` variable.

DONE.
