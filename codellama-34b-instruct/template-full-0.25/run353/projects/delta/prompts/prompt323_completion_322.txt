  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index by one, potentially causing the slice to start at the wrong position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index by one in the opposite direction, potentially causing the slice to end at the wrong position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index, potentially causing the slice to start or end at the wrong position.

DONE.
