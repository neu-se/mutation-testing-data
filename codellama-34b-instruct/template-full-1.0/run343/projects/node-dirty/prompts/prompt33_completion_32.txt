  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `_data` map, but it is not the same as `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is a valid key for the `_data` map, but it is not the same as `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is a valid value for the `_data` map, but it is not the same as `undefined`.

DONE.
