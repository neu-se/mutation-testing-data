  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] && z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
