  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the length property of the current Op object, rather than the length method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the length method of the current Op object, rather than accessing the length property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length - this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the offset from the length of the current Op object, rather than accessing the length property.

DONE.
