Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `field` to `null` would cause the `field(data)` call to throw an error when trying to invoke `null` as a function, leading to a runtime exception instead of returning the original field value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 'dummy' }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `field` with a function that always returns the string `'dummy'` would cause all items to be treated as the same key, resulting in all but the first item being filtered out, regardless of their actual values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `field` to `undefined` would also lead to a runtime error when attempting to call `undefined` as a function, which would disrupt the filtering process and potentially crash the application.

DONE.
