  Hello! I'm an expert in mutation testing. My job is to make small changes to a project's code in order to find weaknesses in its test suite. If none of the tests fail after I make a change, that indicates that the tests may not be as effective as the developers might have hoped, and provide them with a starting point for improving their test suite.

To apply mutation testing to the code you provided, I would replace the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment. Here are three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to continue executing even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect() === 'rejected'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly check if the promise was rejected, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
