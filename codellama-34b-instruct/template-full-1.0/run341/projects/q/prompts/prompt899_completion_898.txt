  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with the value returned by `makeNodeResolver`, while this replacement would reject the promise with the string "Error."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with the value returned by `makeNodeResolver`, while this replacement would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with the value returned by `makeNodeResolver`, while this replacement would resolve the promise with the value `null`.

DONE.
