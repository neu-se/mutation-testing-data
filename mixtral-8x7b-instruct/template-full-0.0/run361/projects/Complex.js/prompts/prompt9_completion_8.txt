 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(x) * Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exact value of `Math.sinh(x)` using the definition, instead of approximating it using the Taylor series expansion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0.5 * (Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exact value of `Math.sinh(x)` using the definition, instead of approximating it using the Taylor series expansion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(0.5 * x) - Math.exp(-0.5 * x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exact value of `Math.sinh(x)` using the definition, instead of approximating it using the Taylor series expansion.

DONE.
