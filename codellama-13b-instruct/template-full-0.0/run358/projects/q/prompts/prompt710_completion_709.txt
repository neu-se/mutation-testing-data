  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object, while the modified code fragment returns a promise for the keys of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [void 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object, while the modified code fragment returns a promise for the keys of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [null])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object, while the modified code fragment returns a promise for the keys of the object itself.

DONE.
