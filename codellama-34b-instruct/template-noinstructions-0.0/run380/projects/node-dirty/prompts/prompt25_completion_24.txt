  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called immediately, rather than being queued to be called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called later, but not necessarily immediately after the data is persisted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called later, but not necessarily immediately after the data is persisted.

DONE.
