  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This code fragment is a simple function call, passing the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function. It is a valid replacement for the original code fragment, but it does not change the behavior of the function in any way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds 1 to the `data` argument before passing it to the `cb` function. This change will cause the function to behave differently, as it will pass a different value to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data * 2)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it multiplies the `data` argument by 2 before passing it to the `cb` function. This change will cause the function to behave differently, as it will pass a different value to the `cb`
