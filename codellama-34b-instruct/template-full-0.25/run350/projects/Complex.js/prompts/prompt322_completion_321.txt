  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` to calculate the cosine, while the replaced code fragment uses `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` to calculate the cosine, while the replaced code fragment uses only `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` to calculate the cosine, while the replaced code fragment uses only `a` and `b`.

DONE.
