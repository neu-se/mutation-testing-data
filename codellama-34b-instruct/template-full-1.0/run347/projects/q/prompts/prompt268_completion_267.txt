  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("My reason");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code explicitly passes the string "My reason" to the reject function, whereas the original code passes the variable `reason`.

Option 2:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(Reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the code explicitly passes the variable `Reason`, whereas the original code passes the variable `reason`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
deferred.fulfill(Reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the code explicitly calls the `fulfill` function, which fulfills the promise, whereas the original code calls the `reject` function, which rejects the promise. Ideally, this should cause a different behavior in the code.
