 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.all()` would be called immediately, instead of using the promised array as an argument to `all` when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all.apply(this, [array])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `apply` method to call `all` with `this` set to the current context and an array of arguments, instead of just passing the array as an argument to `all`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all.call(this, array)
