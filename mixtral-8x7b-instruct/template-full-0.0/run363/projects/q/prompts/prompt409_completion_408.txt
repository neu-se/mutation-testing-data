 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return `null` instead of the original value when the input is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return the value plus one instead of the original value when the input is not a promise. This change would affect the behavior of the function when it is called with a non-promise argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return a promise that resolves to the original value instead of the original value itself when the input is a promise. This change would affect the behavior of the function when it is called with a promise argument.

DONE.
