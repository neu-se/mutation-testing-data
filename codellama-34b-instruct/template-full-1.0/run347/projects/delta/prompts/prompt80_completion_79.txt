  Sure, here are three different code fragments that could be used to replace the `PLACEHOLDER` in the `push` method:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain && newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `retain` operation to the end of the `ops` array if both the current and new operations are `retain` operations.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert && newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `insert` operation to the end of the `ops` array if both the current and new operations are `insert` operations.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete && newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `delete` operation to the end of the `ops` array if both the current and new operations are `delete` operations.
