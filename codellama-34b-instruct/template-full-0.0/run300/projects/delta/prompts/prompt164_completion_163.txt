  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a 'delete' operation, while this replacement checks for an 'insert' operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a 'delete' operation, while this replacement checks for a 'retain' operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a 'delete' operation on the 'this' iterator, while this replacement checks for a 'delete' operation on the 'other' iterator.

DONE.
