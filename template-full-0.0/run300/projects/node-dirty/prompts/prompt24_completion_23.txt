  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, it would become falsy, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits if the first operand is falsy, so if `cb` is falsy, the expression would evaluate to `false`, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits if the first operand is truthy, so if `cb` is truthy, the expression would evaluate to `true`, and the `if` statement would be executed.

DONE.
