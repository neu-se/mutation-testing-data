 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a division by zero error when end is 0, while the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when end is falsy, while the original code would only return true when end is explicitly truthy and cb is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert end to its absolute value, while the original code would not modify end.

DONE.
