  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately, without waiting for the resolver function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved when the original promise is resolved, but it would not have the same value as the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function() { throw new Error('fail'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected immediately with the error 'fail', instead of waiting for the resolver function to be called.

DONE.
