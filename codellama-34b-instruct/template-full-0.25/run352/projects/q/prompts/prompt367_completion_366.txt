  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("some error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with a specific error message, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value.

DONE.
