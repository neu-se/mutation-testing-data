  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the error is passed as an argument to `deferred.reject()`, but in this replacement code, the error is not passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the error is passed as an argument to `deferred.reject()`, but in this replacement code, a null value is passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the error is passed as an argument to `deferred.reject()`, but in this replacement code, an undefined value is passed as an argument.

DONE.
