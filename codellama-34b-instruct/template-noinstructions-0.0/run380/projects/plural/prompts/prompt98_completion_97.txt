  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.replace` is a function that replaces all occurrences of the given substring in the input string, while the new code fragment `w.replace(/a/, 'e')` only replaces the first occurrence of the substring 'a' with 'e'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/g, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.replace` is a function that replaces all occurrences of the given substring in the input string, while the new code fragment `w.replace(/a/g, 'e')` replaces all occurrences of the substring 'a' with 'e'.
