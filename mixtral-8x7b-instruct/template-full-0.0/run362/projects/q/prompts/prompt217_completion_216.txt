 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for pushing `line` into `desiredLines` would be easier to meet, potentially adding unnecessary elements to the `desiredLines` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value !== value
