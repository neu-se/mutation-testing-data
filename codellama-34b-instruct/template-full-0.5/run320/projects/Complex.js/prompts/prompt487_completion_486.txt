  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it has a different behavior than the original `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "infinity", and it has a different behavior than the original `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.EPSILON
```
This would result in different behavior because `EPSILON` is a special value in JavaScript that represents a small positive number, and it has a different behavior than the original `Complex` object.

DONE.
