  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the original code fragment used the `===` operator to check for strict equality. This means that if `this['im']` is not equal to 0, the `valueOf` method will return `null` instead of the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the original code fragment used the `===` operator to check for strict equality. This means that if `this['im']` is equal to 1, the `valueOf` method will return `null` instead of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality
