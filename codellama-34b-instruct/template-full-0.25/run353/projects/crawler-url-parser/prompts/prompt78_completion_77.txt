  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all `a` elements on the page, rather than just the ones inside the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a', this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all `a` elements inside the current element, rather than just the ones on the page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all `a` elements inside the current element, rather than just the ones on the page.

DONE.
