  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on `self`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `Q` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `deferred` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
