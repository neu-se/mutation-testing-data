  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` in the context of a promise refers to the promise object itself, and adding 1 to it would result in a different object, which would cause the promise to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because "hello" is a string, and it would not have the same behavior as `this`, which is a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise object, and the original promise object would be replaced with this new one, which would cause the promise to behave differently.

DONE.
