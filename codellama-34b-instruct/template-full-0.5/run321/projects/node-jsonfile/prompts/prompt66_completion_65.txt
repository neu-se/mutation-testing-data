  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\\uFEFF/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression pattern makes the match case-insensitive, so it would also match on the string "\uFEFF" in any case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\\uFEFF/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression pattern makes the match global, so it would replace all occurrences of the string "\uFEFF" in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\\uFEFF/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression pattern makes the match multi-line, so it would also match on the string "\uFEFF" if it appears at the beginning of a line in the input string.

DONE.
