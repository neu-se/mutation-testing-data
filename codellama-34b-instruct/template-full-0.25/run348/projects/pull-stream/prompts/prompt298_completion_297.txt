  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the data, even if the test failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, even if the test passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negation of the data, even if the test passed.

DONE.
