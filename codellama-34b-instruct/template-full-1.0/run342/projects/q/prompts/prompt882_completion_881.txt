  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dfapply(nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because a different method `dfapply` is called which may have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).succeed
```
This would result in different behavior because the failure case is being handled as a success case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[name](nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because a different method is being called based on the value of `name` which may have a different implementation.

DONE.
