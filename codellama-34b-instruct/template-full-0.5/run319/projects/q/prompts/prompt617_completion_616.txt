  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` and `set` are different methods in the `Promise` prototype, and the `get` method is used to retrieve a property value, while the `set` method is used to set a property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `get` are different methods in the `Promise` prototype, and the `apply` method is used to apply a function to a given context, while the `get` method is used to retrieve a property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` and `get` are different methods in the `Promise` prototype, and the `dispatch` method is used to dispatch a message to a promise, while the `get` method is used to retrieve a property value.

DONE.
