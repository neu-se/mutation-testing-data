  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to immediately return `undefined`, instead of returning a function that can be called repeatedly to iterate over the values in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to immediately return `null`, instead of returning a function that can be called repeatedly to iterate over the values in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to iterate over the values in the array in reverse order, instead of forward order.

DONE.
