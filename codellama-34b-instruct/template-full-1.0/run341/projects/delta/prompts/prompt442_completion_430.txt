  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a valid parameter for the `substr` method, while `offset` is not. Using `length` would cause the method to return a substring starting from the `length` parameter, which is not the intended behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return a substring starting from a different index than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return a substring starting from a negative index, which is not a valid argument for the `substr` method.

DONE.
