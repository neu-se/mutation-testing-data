  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(1 < 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `(1 < 0)` evaluates to `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to skip over the code that initializes the `previousQ` and `global.Q` variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(1 > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `(1 > 0)` evaluates to `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to initialize the `previousQ` and `global.Q` variables, but then skip over the code that sets the `noConflict` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(0 < 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `(0 < 1)` evaluates to `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to initialize the `previousQ` and `global.Q` variables, and then set the `noConflict` function
