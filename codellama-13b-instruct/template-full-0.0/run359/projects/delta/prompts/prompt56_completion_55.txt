  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `ops` property of the `Delta` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the `length` property of the `ops` array. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `ops` property is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `ops` property of the `Delta` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the first element of the `ops` array. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `ops` property is not an array or if the first element of the array is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `ops` property of the `Delta` object, while the new
