  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL is properly formatted, while 'https://' would result in an incorrect URL format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL is properly formatted, while 'http://' + 'https://' would result in an incorrect URL format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://' + 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL is properly formatted, while 'https://' + 'http://' would result in an incorrect URL format.

DONE.
