  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number.

DONE.
