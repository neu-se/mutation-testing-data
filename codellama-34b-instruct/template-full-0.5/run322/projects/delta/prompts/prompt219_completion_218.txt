  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops != other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the two ops are the same, while this replacement checks if they are not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length != other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the two ops are the same, while this replacement checks if their lengths are not the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0] != other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the two ops are the same, while this replacement checks if the first elements of the two ops are not the same.

DONE.
