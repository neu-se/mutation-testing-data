  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero'](z) && z['isZero'](z)) || (this['isInfinite'](z) && z['isInfinite'](z))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` and `isInfinite` methods are being called with `z` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero'](a) && z['isZero'](a)) || (this['isInfinite'](a) && z['isInfinite'](a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` and `isInfinite` methods are being called with `a` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero'](b) && z['isZero'](b)) || (this['isInfinite'](b) && z['is
