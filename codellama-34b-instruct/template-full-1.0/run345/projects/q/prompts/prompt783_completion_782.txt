  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that terminates a promise chain and handles any uncaught errors, whereas `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is fulfilled with the return value of its first argument, or rejected with the thrown error of its second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that waits for all given promises to be fulfilled, or rejected if any of them are. It would not provide the same functionality as `then`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is a method that returns a new promise that is fulfilled with the return value of its first argument, which is a promise that is fulfilled with an array of values. It would not provide the same functionality as `then`.

DONE.
