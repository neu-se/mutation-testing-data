  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[1], point.coordinates[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a different `GeoPoint` object than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0], point.coordinates[1] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is increased by 1, which would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a different `GeoPoint` object than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] + 1, point.coordinates[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is increased by 1, which would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a different `Ge
