  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` expects a value of the input array as the second argument, while `unhandledRejections.length` is a number that represents the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` expects a value of the input array as the second argument, while `unhandledRejections.prototype` is a reference to the prototype object of the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return unhandledRejections;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` expects a value of the input array as the second argument, while `function () { return unhandledRejections; }` is a function that returns the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
