Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr + "/extra");
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra path segment to the base URL, potentially altering the resolution of relative URLs and leading to incorrect parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the base URL would change how relative URLs are resolved, possibly resulting in a failure to generate a valid absolute URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, "http://example.com");
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a fixed base URL instead of the dynamically parsed base URL, which could lead to incorrect URL resolutions for links that are intended to be relative to the original page.

DONE.
