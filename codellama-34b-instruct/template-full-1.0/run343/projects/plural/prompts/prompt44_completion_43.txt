  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `0, w.length - 3`
This would result in different behavior because the substring would start from a different index, potentially including a different letter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `2, w.length - 2`
This would result in different behavior because the substring would start from a different index, potentially including a different letter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `0, w.length`
This would result in different behavior because the substring would get the entire word, not just the plural suffix.

DONE.
