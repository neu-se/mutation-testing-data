  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, while the `call` method is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as a list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that, when called, will have its `this` value set to the first argument and the remaining arguments will be passed to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is used to convert an object to a string, while the `call` method is used to call a function.

DONE.
