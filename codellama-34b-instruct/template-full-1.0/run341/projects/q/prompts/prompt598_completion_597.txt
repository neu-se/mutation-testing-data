  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nextTick(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called immediately instead of being passed as an argument to `nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nextTick(function() { return deferred.resolve.apply(this, arguments); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called with the wrong `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nextTick(function() { return deferred.resolve(promise); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called with the wrong argument.

DONE.
