  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches a backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches a forward slash followed by a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + '\\' + '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches a forward slash followed by two backslashes.

DONE.
