  Option 1:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
"Fixed-value-string"
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options.dest` variable to construct the path for the image file, whereas the replacement code fragment always uses the string "Fixed-value-string" as the path.

Option 2:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
"G"
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options.dest` variable to construct the path for the image file, whereas the replacement code fragment always uses the string "G" as the path.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options.dest` variable to construct the path for the image file, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `path.dirname()` function to construct the path.

DONE.
