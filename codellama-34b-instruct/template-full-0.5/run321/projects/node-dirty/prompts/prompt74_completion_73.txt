  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the key and the number of stored keys, while this new code would emit an event with an empty key and a value of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the key and the number of stored keys, while this new code would emit an event with a key of 1 and a value of the number of stored keys + 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the key and the number of stored keys, while this new code would emit an event with a key of -1 and a value of the number of stored keys - 1.
