  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be longer, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestAnimationFrame` function is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a reference error.

DONE.
