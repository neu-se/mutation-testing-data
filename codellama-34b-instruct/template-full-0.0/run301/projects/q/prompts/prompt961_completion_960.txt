  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with `thisp` set to `undefined`, whereas the new code fragment would set `thisp` to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with `thisp` set to `undefined`, whereas the new code fragment would set `thisp` to `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with `thisp` set to `undefined`, whereas the new code fragment would set `thisp` to `null`.

DONE.
