  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the given element, while `indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise) && unhandledReasons.includes(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the given element, while `indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index. Additionally, this code fragment checks if the `reason` is included in the `unhandledReasons` array, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` checks if the array has any elements, while `indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index.

DONE.
