  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `predicate` function, which means that the `filter` function would keep all elements in the array that do not satisfy the predicate function, rather than keeping only the elements that do satisfy it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){
predicate(Op. august)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function and immediately calls it with `Op.august` as the argument. This could potentially cause the `filter` function to drop or mutate the original operations rather than keeping them as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(predicate, _ => predicate)
```
This would result in different behavior because this is an identity function that returns the first argument it receives, effectively doing nothing. It could cause the `filter` function to preserve the original operations unchanged, rather than potentially changing them.
