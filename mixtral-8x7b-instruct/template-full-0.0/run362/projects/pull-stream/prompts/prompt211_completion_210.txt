 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data to the callback instead of the abort flag, potentially causing incorrect error handling or unexpected behavior in the caller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value instead of the abort flag, potentially causing incorrect error handling or unexpected behavior in the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object instead of the abort flag, potentially causing incorrect error handling or unexpected behavior in the caller.

These changes would not trigger test failures if the tests are only checking for the presence of errors, but they could lead to incorrect behavior in the application. By detecting such mutations, developers can improve their test suites to cover edge cases and ensure the code behaves as expected.

DONE.
