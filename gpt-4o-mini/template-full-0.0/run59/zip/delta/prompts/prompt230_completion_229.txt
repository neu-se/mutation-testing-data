Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to read one more element than available from `otherIter`, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation if `otherIter` has fewer elements than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length by one, which could lead to missing an operation that should have been processed, thus altering the expected output of the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which could lead to incorrect processing of operations, as it would not accurately reflect the intended comparison between the two deltas.

DONE.
