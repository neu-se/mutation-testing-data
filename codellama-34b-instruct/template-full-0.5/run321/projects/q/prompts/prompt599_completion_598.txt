  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is an array, and `args[0]` would only pass the first argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.slice(1)` method would return a new array containing all the elements of `args` except the first one, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code passes the `args` array.

DONE.
