Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a string instead of checking if it is an object, which would cause the function to return `1` for string values instead of handling the case for objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a positive number, which would skip valid object cases and incorrectly return `1` for any non-positive number or non-number types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is strictly `undefined`, which would not account for cases where `op.retain` is an object or a number, leading to incorrect length calculations.

DONE.
