  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` was an array, while `1 + args` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` was an array, while `"abc"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` was an array, while `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
