  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function, while `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb()` is a function call, while `cb` is a function reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(ended, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(ended, cb)` is a function call with two arguments, while `cb` is a single function reference.

DONE.
