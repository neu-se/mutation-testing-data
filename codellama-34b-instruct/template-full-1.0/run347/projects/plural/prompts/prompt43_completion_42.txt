  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 0, which is not the correct length of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the length of the word, which is not the correct length of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return half the length of the word, which is not the correct length of the word.

DONE.
