  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` would return `false` for `null`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` would return `false` for `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` would return `false` for `0`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for `0`.

DONE.
