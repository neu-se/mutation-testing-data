  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy, so the `op` function would always be called, even if `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && op
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` would always be falsey, so the `op` function would never be called, even if `end` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy, so the `op` function would always be called, even if `end` is not strictly equal to true.

DONE.
