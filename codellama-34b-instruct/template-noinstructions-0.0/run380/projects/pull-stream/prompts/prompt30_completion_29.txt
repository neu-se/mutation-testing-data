  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[3]` element would be passed as the third argument to the `pull` function, which is not the same as the `ref[2]` element that was originally passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` element would be passed as the second argument to the `pull` function, which is not the same as the `ref[2]` element that was originally passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[0]` element would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, which is not the same as the `ref[2]` element that was originally passed.

DONE.
