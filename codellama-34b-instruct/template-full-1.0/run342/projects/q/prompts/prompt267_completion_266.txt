  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become,
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become();
```
This would result in different behavior because `become()` is a function that takes no arguments, while the original code snippet passes a single argument to `become()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a reference error.

DONE.
