  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "foo" is not a valid JavaScript expression and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `1 + 1` evaluates to the number 2, which is not a valid JavaScript expression and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `undefined` is not a valid JavaScript expression and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
