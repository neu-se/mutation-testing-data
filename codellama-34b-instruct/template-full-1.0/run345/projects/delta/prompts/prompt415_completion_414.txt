  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` property is used to check if the current op is an insert or retain, but the replacement code would return `false` for both insert and retain ops, resulting in the loop exiting prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` property is used to check if the current op is an insert, but the replacement code would return `true` for both insert and retain ops, resulting in the loop not iterating over insert ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` property is used to check if the current op is a retain, but the replacement code would return `true` for both insert and retain ops
