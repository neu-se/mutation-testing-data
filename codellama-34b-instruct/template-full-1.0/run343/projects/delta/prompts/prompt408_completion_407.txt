  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// return the length of the Delta
delta.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.length` would return the number of operations in the delta, whereas `delta.chop` would return a new `Delta` with the first and last `Op` removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// return a new Delta with all retain operations inverted
delta.invert(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.invert(true)` would invert all retain operations in the delta, whereas `delta.chop` would do nothing to the contents of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// return a string representation of the Delta
delta.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.toString()` would return a string representation of the delta, whereas `delta.chop` would do nothing to the contents of the delta.

DONE.
