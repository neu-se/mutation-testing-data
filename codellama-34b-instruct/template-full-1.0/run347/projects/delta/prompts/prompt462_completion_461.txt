  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the same elements as `rest`, but with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would modify the `rest` array in place by removing the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method would remove the last element from the `rest` array.

DONE.
