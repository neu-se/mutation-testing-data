  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object instead of a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a deprecated country object instead of a non-deprecated one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezonesForCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects instead of a country object.

DONE.
