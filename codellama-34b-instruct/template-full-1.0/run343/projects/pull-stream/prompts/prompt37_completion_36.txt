  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is no longer being accessed with the same index as the original code. The original code was accessing the fourth element of the `ref` array, but this replacement code accesses the third element instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being returned from the `switch` statement is now different. The original code was returning the fourth element of the `ref` array, but this replacement code returns the fourth element plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being returned from the `switch` statement is now different. The original code was returning the fourth element of the `ref` array, but this replacement code returns the fourth element multiplied by 2.

DONE.
