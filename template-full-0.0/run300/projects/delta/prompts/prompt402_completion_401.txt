  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the second key of the `otherData` object instead of the first, which could lead to a different result in the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first key of the `otherData` object is equal to `embedType` and if the value of that key is not null, which could lead to a different result in the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first key of the `otherData` object is equal to `embedType` and if the value of that key is
