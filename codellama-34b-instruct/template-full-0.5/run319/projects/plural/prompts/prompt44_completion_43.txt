  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting from the first character instead of the second-to-last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting from the last character instead of the second-to-last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting from the last character and ending three characters before the end of the string instead of the second-to-last character.

DONE.
