  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(0)` is a function call with a different argument than the original code snippet, and it would cause a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(1)` is a function call with a different argument than the original code snippet, and it would cause a different behavior.

DONE.
