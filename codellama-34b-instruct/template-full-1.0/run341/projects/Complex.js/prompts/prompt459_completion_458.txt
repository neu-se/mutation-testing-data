  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if `b` is negative, whereas the original code returns `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sign(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `0` if `b` is negative, whereas the original code returns `-1` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sign(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `-1` if `b` is negative, whereas the original code returns `1` in that case.

DONE.
