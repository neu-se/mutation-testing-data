  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet, whereas `promise` is a parameter passed to the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet, whereas `promise` is a parameter passed to the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` is a method that is not defined in the code snippet, whereas `promise` is a parameter passed to the `untrackRejection` function.

DONE.
