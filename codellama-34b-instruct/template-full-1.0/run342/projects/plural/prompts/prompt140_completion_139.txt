  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method would be called on `null` instead of a regular expression object, causing it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method would be called on `undefined` instead of a regular expression object, causing it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method would return `true` regardless of the input string, causing the `plural` function to always return the input string plus "s".

DONE.
