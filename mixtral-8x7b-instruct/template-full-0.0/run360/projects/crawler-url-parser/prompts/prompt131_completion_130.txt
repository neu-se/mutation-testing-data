 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/default\.[a-z]+$/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the literal string '/default.[a-z]+$' instead of using a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp('/default\\.[a-z]+$/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new regular expression object with the wrong escape characters, causing it to not match the intended pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/default\.\w+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any word character (equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]) after '\.' instead of only matching lowercase letters.

DONE.
