  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's a string. If `nextOp.delete` is a string, the replacement code would return `true`, while the original code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

typeof nextOp.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's not a number. If `nextOp.delete` is not a number, the replacement code would return `true`, while the original code would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's an
