  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only call `cb(null, data)` if `last` is true, but the mutated code would call `cb(null, data)` if `last` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only call `terminate` if `last` is true, but the mutated code would call `terminate` regardless of the value of `last`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only call `terminate` if `last` is true, but the mutated code would not call `terminate` at all.

DONE.
