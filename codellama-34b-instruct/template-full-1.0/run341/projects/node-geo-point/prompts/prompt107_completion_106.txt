  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the exponent would be 3 instead of 2, which would change the result of the power operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant PI would be used instead of the value 2, which would change the result of the power operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the coordinate would be used instead of the value 2, which would change the result of the power operation and the calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
