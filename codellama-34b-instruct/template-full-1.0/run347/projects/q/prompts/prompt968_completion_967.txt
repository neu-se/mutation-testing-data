  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` value would be the global object in non-strict mode, which would modify the `npost` function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
