  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + 1, '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the accumulator would cause the concatenation of the string representation of 1 to the accumulator, effectively adding an extra character to the concatenation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + Math.PI, '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the mathematical constant pi (Ï€) to the accumulator would cause the concatenation of the string representation of pi to the accumulator, effectively adding an extra character to the concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc * 2, '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of the accumulator by 2 would effectively double the value of the accumulator, causing the concatenation to produce a different result.

DONE.
