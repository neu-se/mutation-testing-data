  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test(data)` would only be executed if `test` is truthy, whereas the new code fragment `test && test(data)` would only be executed if `test` is both truthy and a function. If `test` is not a function, the new code fragment would return `undefined` instead of executing the `test(data)` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test(data)` would only be executed if `test` is falsy, whereas the new code fragment `test || test(data)` would only be executed if `test` is either falsy or a function. If `test` is not a function, the new code fragment would return `undefined` instead of executing the `test(data)` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
