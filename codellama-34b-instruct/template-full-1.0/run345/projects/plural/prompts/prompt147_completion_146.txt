  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test the next rule in the list, potentially causing a different function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first rule, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last rule, regardless of the input.

DONE.
