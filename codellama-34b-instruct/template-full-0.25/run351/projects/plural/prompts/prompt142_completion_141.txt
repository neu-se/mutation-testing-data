  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the word does not match the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if the word matches the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].indexOf(word) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the word does not contain the rule.

DONE.
