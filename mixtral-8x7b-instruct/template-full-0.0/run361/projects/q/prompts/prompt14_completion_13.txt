 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` instead of assigning the Q API to `global.Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an arrow function with an empty block is assigned to `ses.makeQ`, which doesn't have the same behavior as the original code that defines and exports the Q API.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a circular reference by assigning the `global.Q` (which is the Q API) to `ses.makeQ`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or issues with garbage collection.

DONE.
