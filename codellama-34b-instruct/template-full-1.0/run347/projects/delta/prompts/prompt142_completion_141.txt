  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` will return a value, but `thisIter.next(start - index)` will return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` will return a value, but `otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)` will return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length))
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push()` will push a value onto the `ops` array, but `delta.push(otherIter.next(length))` will push `null` onto the `ops` array.

DONE.
