  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `null`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("invalid object"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that rejects with an error, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
