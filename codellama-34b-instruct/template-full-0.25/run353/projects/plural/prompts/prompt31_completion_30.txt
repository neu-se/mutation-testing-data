  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this code fragment removes only the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this code fragment removes only the last character and adds an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this code
