  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `noop`, which means "no operation" and does nothing. In contrast, the new code fragment throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected and the `onRejected` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `noop`, which means "no operation" and does nothing. In contrast, the new code fragment rejects the promise, which would cause the `onRejected` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `noop`, which means "no operation
