  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, whereas `Promise.prototype` is a reference to the prototype object of the `Promise` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(Promise.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(Promise.prototype)` creates a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype, whereas `Promise.prototype` is a reference to the prototype object of the `Promise` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(Promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(Promise)` creates a new object with the `Promise` constructor as its prototype, whereas `Promise.prototype` is a reference to the prototype object of the `Promise` constructor.

DONE.
