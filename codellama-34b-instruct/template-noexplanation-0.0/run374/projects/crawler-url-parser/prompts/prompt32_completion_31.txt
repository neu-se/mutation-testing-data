  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This change will cause the code to always use the HTTPS protocol, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + window.location.hostname
```
This change will cause the code to use the hostname of the current window's location as the base URL, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + document.location.hostname
```
This change will cause the code to use the hostname of the current document's location as the base URL, which may not be desirable in all cases.

DONE.
