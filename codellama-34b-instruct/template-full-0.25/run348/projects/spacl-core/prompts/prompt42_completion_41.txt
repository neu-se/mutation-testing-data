  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to always increment the value of `part` by 1, regardless of its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the code to always double the value of `part`, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the code to always decrement the value of `part` by 1, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
