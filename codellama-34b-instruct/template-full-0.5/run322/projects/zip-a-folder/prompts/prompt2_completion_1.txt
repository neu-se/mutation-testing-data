  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: true,
        gzipOptions: {
            level: o.compression,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option is set to `true`, which would compress the tar archive using gzip, whereas the original code did not use gzip compression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        zlib: {
            level: o.compression,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zlib` option is used instead of `gzip`, which would compress the tar archive
