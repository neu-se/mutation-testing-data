  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inverse` method to return `0` when the input is `Infinity`, instead of returning `Infinity` as the original code would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inverse` method to return `Infinity` even when the input is not `Infinity`, but has an imaginary part that is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im'] == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inverse` method to return `Infinity` even when the input is not `Infinity`, but has a real part and an imaginary part that are both equal to zero.

DONE.
