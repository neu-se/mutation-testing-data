  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `retain` property of `otherOp`, rather than just `otherOp` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to convert `otherOp` to an integer, rather than just returning it as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of `otherOp`, rather than just returning `otherOp` itself.

DONE.
