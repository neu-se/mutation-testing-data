  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, whereas `promise` returns the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch()` returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, whereas `promise` returns the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.finally()` returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, whereas `promise` returns the original promise.

DONE.
