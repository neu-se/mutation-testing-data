Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to increment the value retrieved from the `_data` map, which could lead to unexpected results if the value is not a number or if the key does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key) ? this._data.get(key) : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value to `null` if the key does not exist, instead of returning `undefined`, which could affect how the calling code interprets the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) || 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a default string `'default'` when the value is `undefined`, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the stored data when the key is not found.

DONE.
