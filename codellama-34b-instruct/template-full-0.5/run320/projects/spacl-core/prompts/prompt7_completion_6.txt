  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is replaced with `===`, which would cause the if statement to evaluate to true when the regex match is null, rather than false when the match is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns an array of matches, and the `length` property is used to check if the array is empty. If the array is empty, the if statement would evaluate to true, rather than false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used to check if the array is not empty, and the `>` operator is used to check if the length is greater than 0. If the length is greater than 0,
