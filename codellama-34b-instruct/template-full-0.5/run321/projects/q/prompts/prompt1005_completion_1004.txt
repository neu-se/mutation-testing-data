  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a built-in JavaScript object, and it would likely cause a runtime error when used in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would likely cause a runtime error when used in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would likely cause a runtime error when used in this context.

DONE.
