  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only handles words that end in -ics, but the new code fragment would also handle words that end in -ices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only handles words that end in -ics, but the new code fragment would also handle words that end in -ices.
