Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive `null` instead of the arguments, causing the `value.apply` call to fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive an empty object with a `length` property instead of the arguments, causing the `value.apply` call to fail with a `TypeError`.

These changes would introduce a bug in the `post` method of the returned promise, causing it to fail when called with no arguments. The original code uses the `<PLACEHOLDER>` to pass the
