  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress
```
This would result in a SyntaxError because the function parameters are not separated by a comma.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, rejector, onResolve, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the names of the callback functions have changed, which could cause issues if the functions are being called directly by name elsewhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now using the `.then()` method to handle the promise, rather than passing the callback functions as arguments to the `when()` function.

DONE.
