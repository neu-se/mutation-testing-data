  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--str
```
This would result in a syntax error because `str` is not a valid number or a variable name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in a different value being sent to the `testRegex` function, because a string starting with "hello" would not match the regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in a type error because the `testRegex` function expects a string and null is not a string.

Done.
