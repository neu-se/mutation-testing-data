 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the same as `cos`, but it is more verbose and explicitly calls the global `Math` object. This might cause issues if the code execution context changes or if the `Math` object is not available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0.5 * Math.sin(θ) + 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the new expression calculates the average of `sin(θ)` and 1, which is not the same as `cos(θ)`. This would significantly change the result of the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(Math.sin(θ)) / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of `sin(θ)` using the exponential and logarithmic properties
