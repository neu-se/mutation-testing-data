  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, but the callback here is `noop`, which returns `undefined`. This means that the new promise will be resolved with `undefined`, which is different from the original code where the promise is resolved with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, but the callback here is `noop`, which returns `undefined`. This means that the new promise will be resolved with `undefined`, which is different from the original code where the promise is resolved with the value of `promise`. Additionally, the second `then` method is called on the new promise, which means that the final result will be the return value of
