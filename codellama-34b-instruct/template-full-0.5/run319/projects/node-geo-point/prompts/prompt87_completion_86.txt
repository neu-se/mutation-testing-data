  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would always return 0, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-δ
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would always return a negative value, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * δ
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would always return twice the distance between the two points, regardless of the input coordinates.

DONE.
