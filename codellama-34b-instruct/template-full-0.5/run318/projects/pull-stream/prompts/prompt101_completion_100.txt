  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is different from the original `===` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is different from the original `===` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? err : null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is different from the original `===` operator, and the `err` variable is not being compared to `true` in the same way.

DONE.
