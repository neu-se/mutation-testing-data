 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to push `otherOp` into the `delta` when `thisOp` is not a delete operation, even if `otherOp` is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.insert
