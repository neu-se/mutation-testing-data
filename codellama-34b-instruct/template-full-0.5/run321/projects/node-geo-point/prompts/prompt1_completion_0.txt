  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude !== 'number' || longitude !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the type of `latitude` and `longitude` is not a number, while the new code fragment checks if they are not equal to the string 'number'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude !== 'number' && typeof longitude !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `latitude` or `longitude` is not a number, while the new code fragment checks if both are not numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude !== longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `latitude` and `longitude` are not equal, while the new code fragment checks if they are not equal to each other.

DONE.
