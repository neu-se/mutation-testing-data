  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be updated but not resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called on the wrong context, which would cause an error to be thrown instead of resolving the promise.

DONE.
