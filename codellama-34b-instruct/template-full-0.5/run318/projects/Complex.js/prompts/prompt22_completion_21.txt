  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b`, rather than the sum of their squares.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of the squares of `a` and `b`, rather than their sum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than their product.

DONE.
