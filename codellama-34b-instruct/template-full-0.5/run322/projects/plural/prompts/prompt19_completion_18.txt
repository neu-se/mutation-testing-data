  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "es" to the word, while this new code fragment appends "s" to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, 'es') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "es" to the word, while this new code fragment replaces the last "s" with "es".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, 'ies') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "es" to the word, while this new code fragment replaces the last "s" with "ies".

DONE.
