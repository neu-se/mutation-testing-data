  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`, while this new code checks for equality between the sum of `a[key]` and `b[key]` and `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`, while this new code checks for identity between `a[key]` and `b[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`, while this new code checks for inequality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`.

DONE.
