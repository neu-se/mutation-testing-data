  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done === null` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done === undefined` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof done === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof done` would return `'function'` if `done` is a function, and `typeof done === 'undefined'` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

DONE.
