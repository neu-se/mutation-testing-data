  Thank you for the question. I will apply mutation testing to the following code.

The given code defines a class Dirty that represents a database. The class has methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. The methods include get, set, update, forEach, rm, size, and close. The class also has private methods like _load and _flush.

The PLACEHOLDER in the code is a condition that checks if a row in the JSON data from the readstream is corrupted. The condition is "!('key' in row)", which checks if the 'key' property is not present in the row object.

Here are three mutations that can be applied to change the condition:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in row
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative condition is turned into a positive condition. Now, the mutated code would check if the row object has a 'key' property, and if present, it would consider the row to be corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER
