  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Rejection handled");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this replacement code fragment throws an error when the rejected promise is handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this replacement code fragment returns a new rejected promise with the same reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function () {
    return Q.fulfill(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this replacement code fragment returns a fulfilled promise with the same reason.

DONE.
