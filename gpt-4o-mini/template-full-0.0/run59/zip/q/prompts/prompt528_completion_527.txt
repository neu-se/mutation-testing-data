Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `then` method on the promise returned by `Q(object)`, which is not the intended behavior of inspecting the object; it would lead to a promise resolution instead of returning the inspection result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).value
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access a property `value` on the promise returned by `Q(object)`, which does not exist, leading to `undefined` instead of the expected inspection result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `inspect` method as a function, which may not be defined in the context of the promise returned by `Q(object)`, potentially resulting in a runtime error instead of returning the inspection object.

DONE.
