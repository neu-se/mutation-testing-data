  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(new Op({ insert: '\n' }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new op to the inverted delta, which would insert a newline character, whereas the original code would not insert any new ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(1, { bold: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a retain op with the "bold" attribute to the inverted delta, whereas the original code would not add any attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a delete op with a length of 1 to the inverted delta, whereas the original code would not delete any ops.

DONE.
