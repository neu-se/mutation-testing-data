 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr || 'http://example.com', true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because if `currentUrlStr` is falsy, it will use a default URL instead of returning null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` options are set to `false`, disabling query string parsing and preserving the original case of URL components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` options are set to not include the query string in the returned object.

DONE.
