  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is a variable containing the rejected promise, whereas `this` would refer to the current object in the `inspect` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a variable containing the promise being rejected, whereas `this` would refer to the current object in the `inspect` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(rejection).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise with the provided value, whereas `promise.inspect` simply inspects the current state of the promise.

DONE.
