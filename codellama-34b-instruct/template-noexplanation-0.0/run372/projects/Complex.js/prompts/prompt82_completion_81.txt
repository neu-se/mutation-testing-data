  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This change will cause the code to treat the letter "j" or "J" as the imaginary unit, instead of "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'k' || c === 'K'
```
This change will cause the code to treat the letter "k" or "K" as the imaginary unit, instead of "i" or "I".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'l' || c === 'L'
```
This change will cause the code to treat the letter "l" or "L" as the imaginary unit, instead of "i" or "I".

DONE.
