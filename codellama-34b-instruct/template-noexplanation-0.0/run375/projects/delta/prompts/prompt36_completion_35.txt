  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority
```
This change will cause the `transform` function to always return `b`, regardless of the value of `priority`. This is different from the original code, which only returned `b` if `priority` was `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority && b
```
This change will cause the `transform` function to return `b` if `priority` is `false`, and `undefined` otherwise. This is different from the original code, which only returned `b` if `priority` was `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority || b
```
This change will cause the `transform` function to return `b` if `priority` is `true`, and `undefined` otherwise. This is different from the original code, which only returned `b` if `priority` was `false`.

DONE.
