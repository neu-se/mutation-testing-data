  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is not correct. The pattern matches a forward slash followed by a colon, or a colon followed by a forward slash, or a colon followed by the end of the string. However, the original pattern matches a forward slash followed by a colon, or a colon followed by a forward slash, or a colon followed by any character except a forward slash.

```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/

The pattern matches a forward slash followed by a colon, or a colon followed by a forward slash, or a colon followed by the end of the string.
