  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"qqq"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would attempt to replace the substring "qqq" instead of the intended substring "QReturnValue".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"xxxx"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would attempt to replace the substring "xxxx" instead of the intended substring "QReturnValue".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#$%&"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would attempt to replace the substring "#$%&" instead of the intended substring "QReturnValue".

DONE.
