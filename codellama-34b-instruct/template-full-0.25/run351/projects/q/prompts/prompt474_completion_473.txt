  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove one element from the array, rather than the original code which removes all elements from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove zero elements from the array, rather than the original code which removes all elements from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove all elements from the array, rather than the original code which removes all elements from the array.

DONE.
