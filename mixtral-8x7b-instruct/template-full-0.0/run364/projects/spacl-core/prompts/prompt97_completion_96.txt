 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<any>name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the query method, regardless of the policy, path, verb, or context. The type assertion `<any>` is used to bypass TypeScript's type checking, and the `name` variable is used instead of the policy, which would always be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get(<string>Math.random() * Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random policy from the map instead of the intended one. The `Math.random()` function generates a random float between 0 and 1, which is then multiplied by `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` to create a large integer. This integer is then used as the key to fetch a random policy from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
