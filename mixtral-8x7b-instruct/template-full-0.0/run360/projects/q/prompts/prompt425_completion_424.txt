 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state === "fulfilled" ? "rejected" : "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks for the opposite state of the promise, causing the `isFulfilled` method to return incorrect results for fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().then(function(state) { return state === "fulfilled"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now uses `then` to check the state, which will not work synchronously and may cause issues if the promise is still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor.prototype.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now uses the prototype's `inspect` method, which may not have the correct state for the specific promise instance being checked.

DONE.
