 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'(' + ({key, val: this._data.get(key)}) + ')'
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the object in parentheses instead of serializing it to a JSON string, which could cause issues when parsing the data later on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse('stringify(' + ({key, val: this._data.get(key)}) + ')')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to parse the result of `stringify(...)` as if it were a JSON string, which would fail and throw an error since `stringify` is not a valid function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.stringify(this._data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it serializes the entire `_data` object instead of just the value associated with the given key, which could cause issues when loading the data since the format would
