  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` removes a specific key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with `undefined` as the value would set the key to `undefined`, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key + '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the key-value pair with the key `row.key + ''`, whereas `set()` would set the key-value pair with the key `row.key + ''` to `undefined`.

DONE.
