  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `content` variable, which is a `Buffer` object, and the `utf8` encoding is specified. This would cause the `Buffer` object to be converted to a string using the `utf8` encoding, which may result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('ascii')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `content` variable, which is a `Buffer` object, and the `ascii` encoding is specified. This would cause the `Buffer` object to be converted to a string using the `ascii` encoding, which may result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('base64')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the
