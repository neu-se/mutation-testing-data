  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `progress` function would not be called if `fulfilled` or `rejected` are not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `progress` function would not be called if `fulfilled` or `rejected` are not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, so the `progress` function would not be called if `fulfilled` or `rejected` are not provided.

DONE.
