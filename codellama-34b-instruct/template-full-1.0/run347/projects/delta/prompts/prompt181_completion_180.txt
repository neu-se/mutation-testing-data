  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of ops pushed onto the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.reverse().next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the `otherIter` iterator, causing the retreived ops to be different than those retrieved by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.reverse().next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve one extra op than the original code, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
