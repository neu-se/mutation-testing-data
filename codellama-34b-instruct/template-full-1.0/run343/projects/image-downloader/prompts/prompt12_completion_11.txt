  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.basename` returns the filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename(options.dest, path.extname(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the extension from the dest filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename(options.dest).replace('.', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the extension from the dest filename and replace it with an empty string.

DONE.
