  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "x" because the original code fragment uses the variable "b" which was from the complex number object, while the latter uses "x" as a constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "number(b)" because the original code fragment uses the variable "b" which was from the complex number object, while the latter uses "number(b)" as a number which would provide a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with getHypotenuse(-1,2*b) because the original code fragment uses the function hypot() to calculate the result, while the latter uses getHypotenuse() to calculate the result, which would provide a different result.

DONE.
