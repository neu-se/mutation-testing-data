  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `thisIter` iterator to the `delta` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `otherIter` iterator to the `delta` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value to the `delta` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
