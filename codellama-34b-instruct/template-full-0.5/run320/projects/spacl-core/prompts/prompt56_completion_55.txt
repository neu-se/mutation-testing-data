  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is not a valid regular expression. The original code fragment uses a valid regular expression to replace any occurrence of a dollar sign or a period with the corresponding escaped character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[.$]/g, '\\$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is not a valid regular expression. The original code fragment uses a valid regular expression to replace any occurrence of a dollar sign or a period with the corresponding escaped character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/\$/g, '\\$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is not a valid regular expression. The original code fragment uses a valid regular expression to replace any occurrence of a dollar sign with the corresponding escaped character.

DONE.
