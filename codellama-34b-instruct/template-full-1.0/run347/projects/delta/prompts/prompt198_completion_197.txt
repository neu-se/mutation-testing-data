  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[0]` refers to the first operation in the `delta` ops array, whereas the original code fragment references the last operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0].insert, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[0].insert` refers to the `insert` property of the first operation in the `delta` ops array, whereas the original code fragment references the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0].retain, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[0].retain` refers to the `retain` property of the first operation in the `delta` ops array, whereas the original code fragment references the last operation.

DONE.
