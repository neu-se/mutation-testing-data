  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. In this case, the code is checking if `z` is infinite, but if we replace it with `isNaN`, it will check if `z` is Not-a-Number, which may produce different results.

DONE.
