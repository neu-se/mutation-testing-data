  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return the length of the next operation instead of the current one, leading to incorrect calculations and potential errors in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return the length of the previous operation instead of the current one, leading to incorrect calculations and potential errors in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return the length of the operation after the next one, leading to incorrect calculations and potential errors in the program.

DONE.
