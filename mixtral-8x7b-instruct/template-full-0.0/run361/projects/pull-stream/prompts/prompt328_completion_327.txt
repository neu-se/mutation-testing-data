 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would always be applied, even when the stream has ended. This is different from the original code, where `op` is only applied when the stream has not ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would only be applied once, regardless of whether the stream has ended or not. This is different from the original code, where `op` is applied on every read unless the stream has ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && Math.random() < 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would be applied randomly, depending on the value of `end` and a random number. This is different from the original code, where `op` is applied deterministically based on the value of `end`.

DONE.
