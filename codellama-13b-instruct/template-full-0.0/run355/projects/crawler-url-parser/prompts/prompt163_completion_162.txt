  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method returns `true` if the first argument is a prefix of the second argument, while the `includes` method returns `true` if the first argument is a substring of the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith` method returns `true` if the first argument is a suffix of the second argument, while the `includes` method returns `true` if the first argument is a substring of the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the first argument in the second argument, while the `includes` method returns `true` if
