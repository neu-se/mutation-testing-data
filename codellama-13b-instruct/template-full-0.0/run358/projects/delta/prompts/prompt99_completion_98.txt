  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is now set to `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the `newOp` to be inserted at the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, -1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is now set to `-1` instead of `0`, which would cause the `newOp` to be inserted at the end of the `ops` array instead of the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp` object is now being inserted into the `ops` array instead of the `newOp` object itself. This would cause the `newOp` object to be inserted at the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end.
