  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not null-checked, and the new code fragment would cause a null reference error if `currentUrl` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not undefined-checked, and the new code fragment would cause a type error if `currentUrl` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not a string, and the new code fragment would cause a type error if `currentUrl` is not a string.

DONE.
