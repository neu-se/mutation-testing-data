 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'file'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always write to the file named 'file' instead of using the provided file name in the `file` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write to the current working directory with the name of the provided file as a filename, instead of writing to the specified path in the `file` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number instead of using the provided file name in the `file` variable, causing the write operation to fail.

DONE.
