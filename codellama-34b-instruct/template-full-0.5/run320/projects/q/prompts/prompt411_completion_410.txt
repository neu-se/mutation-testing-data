  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to return `null` instead of an object with information about the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to return an object with information about the promise's state, but without the `value` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to return an object with information about the promise's state, but with the `value` property set to `undefined`.

DONE.
