Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to call the `rejected` callback instead of the `fulfilled` callback, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively ignore the `fulfilled` callback, resulting in the promise being resolved without invoking any fulfillment logic, which could lead to unexpected results in promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `fulfilled` function with the `value` as an argument, which could change the expected resolution value of the promise and alter the flow of promise handling.

DONE.
