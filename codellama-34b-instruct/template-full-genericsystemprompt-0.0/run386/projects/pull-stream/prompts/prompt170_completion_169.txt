  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with `true` as the first argument, while this modified code fragment would call it with `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and `array[i++]` as the second argument, while this modified code fragment would call it with `null` as the first argument and `array[i]` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and `array[i++]` as the second argument, while this modified code fragment would call it with `null` as the first argument and `
