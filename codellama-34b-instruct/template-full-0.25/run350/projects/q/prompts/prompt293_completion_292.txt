  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null), deferred.reject(null), deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, and `deferred.notify` functions as arguments to the `resolver` function, while the modified code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the `resolver` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the resulting promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined), deferred.reject(undefined), deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, and `deferred.notify` functions as arguments to the `resolver` function, while the modified code fragment passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the `resolver` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the resulting promise.
