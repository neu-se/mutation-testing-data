  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of strings, while `match` returns a `RegExpMatchArray` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/]$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has a different pattern and may capture different parts of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/]/, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has a different pattern and may capture different parts of the input string, and the `1` argument specifies the index of the first character to include in the match.

DONE.
