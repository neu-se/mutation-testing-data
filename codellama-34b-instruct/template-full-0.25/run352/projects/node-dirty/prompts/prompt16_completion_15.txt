  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` will remove the key-value pair from the queue, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` will remove all key-value pairs from the queue, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will create a shallow copy of the callbacks array, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

DONE.
