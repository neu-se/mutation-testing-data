  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method of the `String` object that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of all matches of a pattern in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method of the `String` object that returns a boolean indicating whether a specified value is present in a string, whereas `match` returns an array of all matches of a pattern in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` is a method of the `String` object that returns a boolean indicating whether a specified value is present at the beginning of a string, whereas `match` returns an array of all matches of a pattern in a string.

DONE.
