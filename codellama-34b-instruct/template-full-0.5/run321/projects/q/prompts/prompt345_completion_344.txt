  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause an exception to be thrown, whereas `reject` would return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` would cause the function to return immediately, whereas `reject` would return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be returned, whereas `reject` would return a rejected promise.

DONE.
