  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the order of the desired lines to be reversed, which would likely produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the `desiredLines` array, which could potentially cause the resulting string to be incomplete or incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.splice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method would remove the first element of the `desiredLines` array and return a new array containing the removed element, which could potentially cause the resulting string to be incomplete or incorrect.

DONE.
