  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args || []` would still create an empty array if `args` is `undefined`, while `null` would be treated as a valid value and not be replaced with an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args || []` would still create an empty array if `args` is `undefined`, while `undefined` would be treated as a valid value and not be replaced with an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args || []` would still create an empty array if `args` is `undefined`, while `0` would be treated as a valid value and not be replaced with an empty array.

DONE.
