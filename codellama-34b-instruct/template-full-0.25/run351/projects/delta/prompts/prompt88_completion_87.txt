  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this code checks if they are both numbers. This could cause the code to produce different results if the `insert` property of the `newOp` object is a number instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert !== 'string' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this code checks if they are not strings. This could cause the code to produce different results if the `insert` property of the `newOp` object is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object
