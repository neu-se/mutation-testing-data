  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im': 1,
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to 1, while this code does not set `z['im']` at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im': -1,
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to 1, while this code sets `z['im']` to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im': z['re'],
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to 1, while this code sets `z['im']` to `z['re']`.

DONE.
