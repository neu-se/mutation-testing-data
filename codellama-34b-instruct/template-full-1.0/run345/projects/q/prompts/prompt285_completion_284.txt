  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expected to return a value, but the replacement code fragment would return null instead, which would cause the `promise.resolve` function to resolve the promise with a value of null, instead of resolving it with the value of the `value` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expected to return a value, but the replacement code fragment would return undefined instead, which would cause the `promise.resolve` function to resolve the promise with a value of undefined, instead of resolving it with the value of the `value` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expected to return a non-zero value, but the replacement code fragment would return 0 instead, which would cause the `promise.resolve` function to resolve the promise with a value of
