  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being passed to the `stringify` function, which could result in incorrect encoding of the JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not being passed to the `JSON.parse` function, which could result in incorrect parsing of the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not being passed to the `JSON.parse` function, which could result in incorrect error handling when parsing the JSON data.

DONE.
