  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop()` method on the `delta` object, while this code fragment calls the `chop()` method on the result of `concat(rest)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop()` method on the `delta` object, while this code fragment calls the `slice()` method on the result of `concat(rest)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop()` method on the `delta` object, while this code fragment calls the `slice()` method on the result of `concat(rest)` with a different argument.

DONE.
