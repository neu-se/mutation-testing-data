  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw` is a boolean variable that indicates whether an exception was thrown, while `!threw` is the negation of that variable, meaning it will be true if an exception was not thrown. In the original code, the `if` statement checks if an exception was not thrown, and if so, it calls the `deferred.notify(newValue)` method. If we replace `!threw` with `threw`, the `if` statement will only be true if an exception was thrown, and the `deferred.notify(newValue)` method will not be called. This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify(newValue)` method is not called when an exception is thrown, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected without notifying the progress.

DONE.
