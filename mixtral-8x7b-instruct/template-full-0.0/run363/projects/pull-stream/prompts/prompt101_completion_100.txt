 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new error object, even when `err` is not truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 1, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the string 'string' or 'object' instead of null or the error object.

DONE.
