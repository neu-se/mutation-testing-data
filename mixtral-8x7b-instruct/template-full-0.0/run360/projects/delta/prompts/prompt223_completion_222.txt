 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty Delta object, instead of diff()'ing the second string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access an undefined index in the strings array, causing an error and different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'hardcoded string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the second string with a hardcoded string, causing the diff() function to compare two different strings and potentially produce different results.

DONE.
