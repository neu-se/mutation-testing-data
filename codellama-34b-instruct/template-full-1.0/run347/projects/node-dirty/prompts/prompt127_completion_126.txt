  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
this._queue.size > 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```

This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, so if the `_queue` is not empty and there is no pending drain, the `_flush()` method would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
this._queue.size == 0 || this._waitForDrain
```

This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `_queue` is empty or if there is a pending drain, and if either condition is true, the `_flush()` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
this._queue.size > 0 && this._waitForDrain
```

This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `_queue` is not empty and if there is a pending drain, and if both conditions are true, the `_flush()` method would not be called.
