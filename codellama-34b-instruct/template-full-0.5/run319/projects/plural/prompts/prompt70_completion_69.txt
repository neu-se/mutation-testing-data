  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "cello" and replace it with "cellos", while this new code fragment uses a hard-coded string to match the word "cello" and replace it with "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^cello$/i, 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "cello" and replace it with "cellos", while this new code fragment uses a regular expression with the "i" flag to match the word "cello" regardless of case and replace it with "cellos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos', function(w) { return w.replace(/^cello$/i, 'cellos') })
```
This would result
