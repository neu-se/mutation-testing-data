  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `return` statement to be executed even if `aborted` is not true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression, causing the `return` statement to be executed only if `aborted` is true and `false` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression, causing the `return` statement to be executed only if `aborted` is true or `true` is true.

DONE.
