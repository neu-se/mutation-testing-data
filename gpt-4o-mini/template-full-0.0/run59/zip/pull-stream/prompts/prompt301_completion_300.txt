Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the value of `end`, causing `ended` to be true when `end` is false, which may lead to premature termination of the reading process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `ended` to true unconditionally, which would prevent any further data from being read, regardless of the actual value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always set `ended` to false if `end` is true, which could lead to the reading process continuing indefinitely even when it should terminate.

DONE.
