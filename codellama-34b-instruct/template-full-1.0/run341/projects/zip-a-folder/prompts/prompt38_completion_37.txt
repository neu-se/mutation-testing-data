  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the "isGlob" function would always return false, even if the input is a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the "isGlob" function would always return false, even if the input is a glob, and it would also cause the application to throw an error when trying to access the "split" method of a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the "isGlob" function would always return true, even if the input is not a glob, and it would cause the application to compress the input as a glob, even if it is not one.

DONE.
