  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a reserved word in JavaScript and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to `null` instead of getting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `post` method on the object instead of getting the property.

DONE.
