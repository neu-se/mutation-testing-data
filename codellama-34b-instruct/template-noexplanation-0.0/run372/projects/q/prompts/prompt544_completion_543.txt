  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the `StopIteration` constant is defined, rather than if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration !== undefined
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the `StopIteration` constant is not equal to `undefined`, rather than if it is equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!StopIteration
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the `StopIteration` constant is falsy, rather than if it is truthy.

DONE.
