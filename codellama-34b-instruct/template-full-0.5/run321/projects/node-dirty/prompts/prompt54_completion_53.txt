  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called immediately, regardless of whether the stream is drained or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called with a different number of arguments, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called with a different number of arguments, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

DONE.
