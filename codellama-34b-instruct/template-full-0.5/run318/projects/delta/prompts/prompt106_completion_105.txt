  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (predicate(op, index) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is only called for the first element in the array, and the other elements are ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is only called for every other element in the array, and the other elements are ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (predicate(op, index) && op.insert != null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is only called for elements that have an `insert` property, and the other elements are ignored.

DONE.
