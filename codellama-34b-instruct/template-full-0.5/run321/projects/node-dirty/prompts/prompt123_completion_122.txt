  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.clear()` would empty the queue, causing the loop to terminate early, whereas `this._flush()` would continue processing the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.delete(key)` would remove the current key from the queue, causing the loop to skip over it, whereas `this._flush()` would continue processing the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.push(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.push(key)` would add the current key to the end of the queue, causing the loop to process it again, whereas `this._flush()` would continue processing the queue.

DONE.
