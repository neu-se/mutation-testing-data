  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would have uncorked the write stream with the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`, whereas the new code fragment would always uncork the write stream with the value `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would have uncorked the write stream with the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`, whereas the new code fragment would always uncork the write stream with the value `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior
