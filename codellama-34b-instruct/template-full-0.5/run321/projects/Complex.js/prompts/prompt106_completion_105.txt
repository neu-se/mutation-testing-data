  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `parser_exit()` function, but the replaced code fragment does, which would cause the program to exit prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a `Complex` object with `re` and `im` properties set to `NaN`, but the replaced code fragment returns a `Complex` object with `re` and `im` properties set to `Complex['NAN']`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a `Complex` object with `re` and `im` properties set to `Infinity`, but the replaced code fragment returns a `Complex` object with `re` and `im` properties set
