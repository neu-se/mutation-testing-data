  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because a and b are equal, so the result would be the same as if the second half of the function were not executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because z is not a constant, so it could have a different value than c in different executions of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because a + b would be a different value than c, so the result would be different.

DONE.
