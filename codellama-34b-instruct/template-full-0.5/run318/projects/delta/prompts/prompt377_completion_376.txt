  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().type
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the other delta, while `otherIter.next().type` returns the type of the current operation in the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the other delta, while `otherIter.next().length` returns the length of the current operation in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the other delta, while `otherIter.next().retain` returns the retain attribute of the current operation in the other delta.

DONE.
