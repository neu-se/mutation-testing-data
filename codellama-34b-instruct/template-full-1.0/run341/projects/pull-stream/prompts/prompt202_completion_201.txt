  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error message, while the replaced code would call it with `null`, which could cause the error to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error message, while the replaced code would call it with `undefined`, which could cause the error to be silently ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error message, while the replaced code would call it with the string `"error"`, which could cause the error to be misinterpreted.

DONE.
