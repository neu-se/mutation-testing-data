Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + '1', options
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the timezone name by appending '1', potentially leading to a lookup for a non-existent timezone, which would return `null` instead of the expected country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the timezone name to uppercase, which may not match the keys in the `timezones` object, resulting in a failure to find the correct timezone and returning `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options, tzName
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters, which could lead to incorrect handling of the options object and potentially cause unexpected results when retrieving the country.

DONE.
