Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next operation in the array instead of the current one, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations and unexpected results when calling `peekLength()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] || { insert: '' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to an object with an empty `insert` property if the current operation is undefined, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations when they are not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] && this.ops[this.index].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `insert` property of the current operation if it exists, which could lead to returning `undefined` instead of the operation itself, affecting the length calculation in `peekLength()`.

DONE.
