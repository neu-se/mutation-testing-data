  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` removes the key-value pair from the map, whereas `set` updates the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with an undefined value would remove the key-value pair from the map, whereas `delete` would only remove the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with a non-undefined value would update the value associated with the key, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair from the map.

DONE.
