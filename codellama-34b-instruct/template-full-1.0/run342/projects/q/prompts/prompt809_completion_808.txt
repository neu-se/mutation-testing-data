  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply = function( obj, args ) { return 'apple'; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "apple", rather than applying the callback function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply = function( obj, args ) { throw new Error( 'Spaghetti' ); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error, rather than applying the callback function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply = function( obj, args ) { return 42; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the number 42, rather than applying the callback function itself.

DONE.
