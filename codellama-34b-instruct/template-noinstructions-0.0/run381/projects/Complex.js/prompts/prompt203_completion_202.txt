  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(b, a)` is the exponential function with base `b` and argument `a`, whereas `Math.pow(a, b)` is the power function with base `a` and exponent `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a, b)` is the exponential function with base `a` and argument `b`, whereas `Math.pow(a, b)` is the power function with base `a` and exponent `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a + b)` is the exponential function with argument `a + b`, whereas `Math.pow(a, b)` is the power function with base `a` and exponent `b
