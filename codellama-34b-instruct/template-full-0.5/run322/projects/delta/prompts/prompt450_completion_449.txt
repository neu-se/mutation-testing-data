  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both numbers and objects, while this replacement only checks for strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of the `retain` property, while this replacement checks for a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `retain` property, while this replacement checks for its absence.

DONE.
