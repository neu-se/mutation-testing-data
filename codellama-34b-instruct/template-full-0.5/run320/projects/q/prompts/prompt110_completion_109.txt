  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking for inequality instead of equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i + 1] === value
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] == value
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be using abstract equality comparison instead of strict equality comparison.

DONE.
