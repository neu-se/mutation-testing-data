Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `abort` is strictly equal to `false`, which will always evaluate to `false` if `abort` is `true`, leading to a different outcome in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value of `abort` by adding `1`, which could lead to unexpected results if `abort` is a number or a string that can be coerced into a number, thus changing the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original value of `abort` with `undefined`, which may cause the callback to behave differently, especially if it relies on the presence of a valid value.

DONE.
