Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(b)` returns an array of the values of the properties of `b`, which may not match the expected embed type, leading to incorrect error messages or logic flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because using the iterator method directly would not return the key of the first property of `b`, potentially causing the embed type check to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the embed type to the number of keys in `b`, which is not a valid comparison and would always lead to an error, regardless of the actual embed type.

DONE.
