  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to a function, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` except the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to a function, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` except the first two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to a function, whereas `array_slice(arguments
