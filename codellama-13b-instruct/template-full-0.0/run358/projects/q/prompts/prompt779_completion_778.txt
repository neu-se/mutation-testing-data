  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected, and it would also cause the rejection to be swallowed, meaning that the error would not be propagated to the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {}, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled immediately, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected, and it would also cause the fulfillment to be swallowed, meaning that the value would not be propagated to the caller.

DONE.
