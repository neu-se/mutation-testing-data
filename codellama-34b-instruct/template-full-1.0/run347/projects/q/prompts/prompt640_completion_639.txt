  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the object passed to the `dispatch` method from the `object` variable to the `promise` variable, which may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the `object` variable directly, rather than on the `Q(object)` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the `promise` property of the `object` variable, rather than the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
