 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks for `undefined` values, which were previously treated the same as non-object types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'object' || a === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it now treats the boolean value `true` as a non-object type, which was previously treated the same as other non-object types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks for non-function types, which would allow objects to pass the condition, whereas before, only non-object types were allowed.

DONE.
