  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` expression would evaluate to `true` if `end` is `null` or `undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to execute differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end !== false` expression would evaluate to `true` if `end` is any value other than `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to execute differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end !== true` expression would evaluate to `true` if `end` is any value other than `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to execute differently than the original code.

DONE.
