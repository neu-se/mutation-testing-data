  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `nbind` method return the `object` instead of a wrapped function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `nbind` method return a bound function instead of a wrapped function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return callback.bind(thisp); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `nbind` method return a function that returns a bound function instead of a wrapped function.

DONE.
