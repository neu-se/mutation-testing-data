  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because "deferred" is not a method of `Q.reject`, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is not a method of `Q.reject`, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is not a method of `Q.reject`, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
