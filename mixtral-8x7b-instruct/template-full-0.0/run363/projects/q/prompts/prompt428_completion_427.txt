 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return false, regardless of the input's promise state. This is because `false` is a falsy value, and the original code checks if the object is an instance of Promise and if its state is "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return `null`, which would not match any of the expected return values. This would cause the function to effectively stop working as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `isRejected` function would refer to the global object (or the parent object if the function is a method), rather than the input object. This could lead to incorrect promise state determination, causing unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
