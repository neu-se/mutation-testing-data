  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a reference to a function, whereas `onAbort()` is a function call, which would execute the `onAbort` function and return its result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a reference to a function, whereas `onAbort.call(this)` is a function call with an explicit `this` context, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a reference to a function, whereas `onAbort.apply(this, arguments)` is a function call with an explicit `this` context and an `arguments
