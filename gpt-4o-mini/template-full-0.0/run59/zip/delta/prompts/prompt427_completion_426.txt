Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the function to return `undefined` for cases where `op.retain` is actually a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is `null`, which would lead to the function returning `undefined` when `op.retain` is a number or an object, thus not correctly calculating the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `op.retain` when it is an object, instead of returning the length of the retain operation when it is a number, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations.

DONE.
