  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is now being called with a parameter of `0`, which is not the same as the original code where it was called with no parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is now being called with a parameter of `1`, which is not the same as the original code where it was called with no parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is now being called with no parameters, which is not the same as the original code where it was called with a parameter of `0`.

DONE.
