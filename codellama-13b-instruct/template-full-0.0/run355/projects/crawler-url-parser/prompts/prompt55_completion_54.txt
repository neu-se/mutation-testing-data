  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrlStr` variable is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore would cause a runtime error if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl` variable is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore would cause a runtime error if used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format()` method is used to format the `parsedUrl` object as a string, which would cause the code to return a string instead of an object.

DONE.
