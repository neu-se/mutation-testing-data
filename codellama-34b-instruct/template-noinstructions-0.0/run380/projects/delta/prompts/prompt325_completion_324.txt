  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last character of the slice, which could potentially cause the `eachLine` method to miss a line break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra character in the slice, which could potentially cause the `eachLine` method to include an extra line break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last two characters of the slice, which could potentially cause the `eachLine` method to miss two line breaks.

DONE.
