  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the `test` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments, the second of which is `null`, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
