  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function with a length of 1, but this replacement checks if `a` is a function with a length of 2. If `a` is a function with a length of 1, the original code fragment would return a function with a length of 1, but the replacement would return a function with a length of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function with a length of 1, but this replacement checks if `a` is an object with a length of 1. If `a` is a function with a length of 1, the original code fragment would return a function with a length of 1, but the replacement would return an object with a length of 1.
