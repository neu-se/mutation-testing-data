  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('Hello, world!')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment writes the contents of the archive to the output stream, while this new code fragment writes a hardcoded string to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment writes the contents of the archive to the output stream, while this new code fragment ends the output stream without writing anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('Hello, world!', 'utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment writes the contents of the archive to the output stream, while this new code fragment writes a hardcoded string to the output stream using a different encoding.

DONE.
