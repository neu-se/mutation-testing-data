  MUTATION TESTING ANSWERS START OPTION 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```/anucleus|syllabus|foci|fcactus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match words like "nucleus" properly.

OPTION 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```/nucleus|syllabus|amygdala|fungus|cactus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the word "amygdala" as a plural form of "amygdala", which is not correct.

 OPTION 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungi|cacti/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the word "fungi" as a plural form of "fungi", which is not correct.

DONE.
