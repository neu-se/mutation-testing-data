  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it includes the `g` flag at the end, which makes the regular expression global, meaning it will match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it includes the `i` flag at the end, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, meaning it will match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it includes the `m` flag at the end, which makes the regular expression multi-line, meaning it will match the pattern across multiple lines in the input string.

DONE.
