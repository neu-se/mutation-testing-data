  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of the pattern `/default\.[a-z]+$/` with a backslash (`\`) instead of a forward slash (`/`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of the pattern `/default\.[a-z]+$/` with a forward slash (`/`) instead of a backslash (`\`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of the pattern `/default\.[a-z]+$/` with a backslash (`\`) followed by a forward slash (`/`) instead of a forward slash (`/`) alone.

DONE.
