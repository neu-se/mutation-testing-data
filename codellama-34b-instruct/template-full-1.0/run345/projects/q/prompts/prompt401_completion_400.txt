  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().catch(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would swallow any errors that might have occurred in the `this.then` block, which would change the behavior of the code and potentially make it behave in an unexpected way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().throw(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` block would throw an error, which would change the behavior of the code and potentially make it behave in an unexpected way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().finally(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` block would always execute, regardless of whether the `this.then` block completed successfully or not, which would change the behavior of the code and potentially make it behave in an unexpected way.

DONE.
