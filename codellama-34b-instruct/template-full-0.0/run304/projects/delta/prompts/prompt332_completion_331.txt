  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would be called with an additional argument, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
