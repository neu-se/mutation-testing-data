Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object, rather than concatenating the arrays together, which would lead to incorrect pluralization rules being applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.join(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` converts the array into a string with elements separated by commas, which would not match any of the pluralization rules and would cause the regex to fail to find a match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.map(w => w + 's')
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, which would change the contents of the array to be pluralized forms instead of the original singular forms, leading to incorrect pluralization logic.

DONE.
