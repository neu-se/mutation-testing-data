  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This change will cause the `_flush` method to be called only when there are items in the queue and there are in-flight writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size || this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This change will cause the `_flush` method to be called only when there are items in the queue or there are in-flight writes that are less than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This change will cause the `_flush` method to be called only when there are items in the queue and there are no in-flight writes.

DONE.
