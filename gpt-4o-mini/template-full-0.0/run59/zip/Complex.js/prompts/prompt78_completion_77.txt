Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows `i` to equal `tokens.length`, which would lead to an out-of-bounds access when `tokens[i]` is evaluated, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the loop to iterate only up to the second-to-last element of the `tokens` array, causing the last token to be ignored in the parsing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it starts the index `i` at 1 instead of 0, which means the first token in the `tokens` array will be skipped during parsing, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
