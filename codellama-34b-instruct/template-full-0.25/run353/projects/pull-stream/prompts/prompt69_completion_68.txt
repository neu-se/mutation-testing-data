  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `doneLackingErr` is an Error object, and `doneLackingErr.message` is a string containing the error message. In the original code, the error object is simply logged to the console, but with this change, the error message is logged instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `doneLackingErr.stack` is a string containing the error stack trace, which is different from the error message. In the original code, the error object is simply logged to the console, but with this change, the error stack trace is logged instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `doneLackingErr.name` is a string containing the error name, which is different from the error message. In the original code
