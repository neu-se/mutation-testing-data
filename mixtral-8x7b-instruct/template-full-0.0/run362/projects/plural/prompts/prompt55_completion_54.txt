 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/fe?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will always match the last two characters of the input string, instead of using the provided regex variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp('fe?$', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will be created dynamically, but the 'g' flag is missing, which might affect the behavior when the function is called multiple times with the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-zA-Z]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will match any sequence of letters at the end of the input string, instead of using the provided regex variable.

DONE.
