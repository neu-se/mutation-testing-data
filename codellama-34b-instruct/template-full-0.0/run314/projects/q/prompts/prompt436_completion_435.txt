  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the specified element, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.some(function(p) { return p === promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` checks if any element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index.

DONE.
