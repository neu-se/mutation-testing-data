  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length` is a number, while `thisData` is an object, and the `retain` method expects an object as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.toString()` returns a string representation of the `thisData` object, while `thisData` is an object and the `retain` method expects an object as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.valueOf()` returns the primitive value of the `thisData` object, while `thisData` is an object and the `retain` method expects an object as its argument.

DONE.
