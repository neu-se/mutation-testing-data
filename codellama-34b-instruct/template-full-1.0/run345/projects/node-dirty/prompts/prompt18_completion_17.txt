  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.shift()` would remove the first element from the `cbs` array, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.pop()` would remove the last element from the `cbs` array, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => !cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(cb => !cb)` would remove any element from the `cbs` array that satisfies the condition, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
