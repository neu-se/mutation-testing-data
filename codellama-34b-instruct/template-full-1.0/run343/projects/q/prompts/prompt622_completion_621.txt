  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `null` element to the array, which would change the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the positions of the `key` and `value` arguments, which would change the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, 42]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `42` element to the array, which would change the function's behavior.

DONE.
