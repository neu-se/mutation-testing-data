  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```json
"'"
```
This would result in different behavior because a single-line comment is introduced, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that assumes the code fragment will be a dollar sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```json
" /*"
```
This would result in different behavior because a multi-line comment is introduced, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that assumes the code fragment will be a dollar sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```json
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is now a string literal, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that assumes the code fragment will be a dollar sign.

DONE.
