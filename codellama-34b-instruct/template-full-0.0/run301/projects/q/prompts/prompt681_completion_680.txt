  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start at the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to be applied to the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would only take the first two arguments instead of all of them, which could cause the function to be applied to the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would take all arguments except the last one instead of all of them, which could cause the function to be applied to the wrong arguments.

DONE.
