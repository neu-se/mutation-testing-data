  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be `&&` with `done`. This would cause the `sink.abort` function to always return `undefined` instead of the expected `read(abort, cb || function () {})`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be `?` with `done`. This would cause the `sink.abort` function to always return `undefined` instead of the expected `read(abort, cb || function () {})`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {}
