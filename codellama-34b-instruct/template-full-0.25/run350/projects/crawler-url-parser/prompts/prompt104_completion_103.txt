  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `text` property of `tmpUrl` includes the `text` property of the current URL, while this modified code fragment checks if the `text` property of `tmpUrl` includes a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(currentUrl.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `text` property of `tmpUrl` includes the `text` property of the current URL, while this modified code fragment checks if the `text` property of `tmpUrl` includes the `text` property of the current URL and the `text` property of the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(currentUrl.text.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `text` property
