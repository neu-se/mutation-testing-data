  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, so the `onAbort` callback would be called with `null` instead of `abort` when `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `abort` variable, so the `onAbort` callback would be called with a different value than `abort` when `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator would assign `false` to the `abort` variable, so the `onAbort` callback would not be called when `abort` is `true`.

DONE.
