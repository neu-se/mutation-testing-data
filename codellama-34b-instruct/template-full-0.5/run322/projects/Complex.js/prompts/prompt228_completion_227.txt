  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.sqrt(2 * (r + a))` calculates the square root of a positive number, while the new code fragment `Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))` calculates the square root of a negative number, which is a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.sqrt(2 * (r + a))` calculates the square root of a positive number, while the new code fragment `Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a) + 1)` calculates the square root of a positive number plus 1, which is a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(1 / (2 * (r - a)))
```
This would result
