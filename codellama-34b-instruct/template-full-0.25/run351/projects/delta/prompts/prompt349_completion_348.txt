  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined in the `AttributeMap` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined in the `AttributeMap` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined in the `AttributeMap` class, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
