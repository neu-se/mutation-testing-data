  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a valid method name, but it is not what the code is expecting. The `post` method is used to invoke a function on the target object in a future turn, so replacing it with `put` would cause the code to attempt to invoke a function called "put" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a JavaScript reserved keyword and a different method name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post;"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `post` method to be called with an additional (unexpected) semicolon at the end. It would still be parsed as a string, but it would evaluate as "post;" rather than just "post".

DONE.
