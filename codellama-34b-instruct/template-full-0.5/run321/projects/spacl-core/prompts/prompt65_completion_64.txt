  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...this.rules
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the same array of rules onto the policy, rather than the new rules passed as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the array of rules, rather than pushing the original array onto the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.map((rule) => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deep copy of the array of rules, rather than pushing the original array onto the policy.

DONE.
