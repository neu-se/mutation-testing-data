 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` is specifically `null`, instead of checking if it is falsy. This might cause the function to not return the `id` when a user passes a falsy value that is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` has a `length` property and if it's greater than zero, which is not the same as checking if `mapper` is truthy. This might cause the function to not return the `id` when a user passes a truthy value that doesn't have a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof mapper === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` is a function, instead of checking if it's truthy. This
