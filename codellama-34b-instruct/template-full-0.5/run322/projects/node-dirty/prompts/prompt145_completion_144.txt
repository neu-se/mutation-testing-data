  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument `err`, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument `'foo'`, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument `this._queue.size`, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
