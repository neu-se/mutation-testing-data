  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` computes the arcsine, which is the angle in radians whose sine is the specified number, while `cosφ2` computes the cosine of the angle `φ2` in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` computes the arcsine, which is the angle in radians whose sine is the specified number, while `sinφ2` computes the sine of the angle `φ2` in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` computes the arcsine, which is the angle in radians whose sine is the specified number, while `2 * cosφ2` computes twice the cosine of the angle `φ2` in radians.
