  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(typeof data === "string" ? cheerio.load(data) : data);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is checking if the `data` variable is a string, and if so, it is loading the data into Cheerio before logging it. In the original code, the `data` variable is being passed directly to Cheerio without checking its type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.is(":root"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now using the `is()` method of the `data` object to check if it is a root element, which may not always be the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log($("a:first-child").attr("href"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now selecting the href attribute of the first child `a` element, which may not
