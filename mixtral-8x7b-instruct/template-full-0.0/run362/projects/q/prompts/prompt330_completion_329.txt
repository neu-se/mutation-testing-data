 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Buggy error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message, which might cause some tests to fail if they are checking for specific error messages.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the value being returned, which might cause some tests to fail if they are checking for specific types or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the returned value to an empty object, which might cause some tests to fail if they are checking for specific values or types.

DONE.
