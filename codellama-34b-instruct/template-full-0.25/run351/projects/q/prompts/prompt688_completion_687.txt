  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "apply" method on the object, but with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "apply" method on the object, but with a different set of arguments.
