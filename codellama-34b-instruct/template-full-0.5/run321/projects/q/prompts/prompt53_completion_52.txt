  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof process` would return "undefined" instead of "object", causing the condition to fail and the `nextTick` function to not be set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString()` would return a different string, causing the condition to fail and the `nextTick` function to not be set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` would be undefined, causing the condition to fail and the `nextTick` function to not be set.

DONE.
