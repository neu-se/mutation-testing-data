  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with `arguments` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null, arguments[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with `null` as the first argument and `arguments[0]` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
