  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to return an empty array instead of the remaining ops in the iterator, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to return an array containing the current op, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to only return ops that are deletions, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
