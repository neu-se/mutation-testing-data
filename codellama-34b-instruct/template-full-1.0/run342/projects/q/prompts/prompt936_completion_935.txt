  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = array_slice(nodeArgs, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable would be initialized with the wrong value, leading to a different result in the `Q.nfbind` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var nodeArgs = array_proto.slice.call(arguments, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable would be initialized with a different value, leading to a different result in the `Q.nfcall` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = array_proto.slice.call(arguments, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable would be initialized with a different value, leading to a different result in the `Q.nbind` method.

DONE.
