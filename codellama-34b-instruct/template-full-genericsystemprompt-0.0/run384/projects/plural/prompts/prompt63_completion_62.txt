  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "bacterium" specifically, while the new code fragment would match any word that ends with "bacteria".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "bacterium" specifically, while the new code fragment would match any word that ends with "bacterium".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "bacterium" specifically, while the new code fragment would match any word that ends with "bacteria".

DONE.
