 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to positive infinity, instead of checking if the value is infinite regardless of its sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is zero, which is not equivalent to checking if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if dividing one by the real part results in zero, which is not equivalent to checking if the value is infinite.

DONE.
