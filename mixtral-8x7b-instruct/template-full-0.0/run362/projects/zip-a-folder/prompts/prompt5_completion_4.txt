 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(zipAFolderOptions || {}).length === 0 && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `zipAFolderOptions` is an empty object instead of checking if it has a customWriteStream property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && zipAFolderOptions?.targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a non-existent property `targetFilePath` instead of `targetFilePath` existing and not being equal to `src`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!zipAFolderOptions?.['customWriteStream'] && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation instead of dot notation to access the `customWriteStream` property.

DONE.
