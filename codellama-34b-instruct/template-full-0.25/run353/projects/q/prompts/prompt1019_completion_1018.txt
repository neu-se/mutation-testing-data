  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` would simply call the `dispatch` method on `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` would call the `dispatch` method on `this` with `this` as the context, whereas `this.dispatch` would simply call the `dispatch` method on `this` with no specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` would call the `dispatch` method on `this` with `this` as the context and an empty argument list, whereas `this.dispatch` would simply call the `dispatch` method
