  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `args` is a truthy value. In the original code, `args` is passed as the second argument to `Q.nfapply`, which is a function that expects an array of arguments. If `args` is `null`, the function will likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and `args` is an array of arguments. In the original code, `args` is passed as the second argument to `Q.nfapply`, which is a function that expects an array of arguments. If `args` is `[]`, the function will likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[1, 2, 3]` is an array of numbers
