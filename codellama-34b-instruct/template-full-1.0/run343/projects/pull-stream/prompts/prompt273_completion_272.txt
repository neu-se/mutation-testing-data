  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is not an object, whereas the original code checks if `stream` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is not a function, whereas the original code checks if `stream` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the type of `stream`. The original code checks if `stream` is an object or a function, and calls `values` or `once` accordingly.

DONE.
