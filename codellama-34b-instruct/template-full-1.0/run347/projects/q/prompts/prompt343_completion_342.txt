  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to `then` would be called with the rejection reason, rather than the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number would be passed to the `then` function, rather than the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` function would not be passed any argument, rather than the fulfilled value.

DONE.
