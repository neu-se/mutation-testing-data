  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would modify the input `countryId` value, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"country" + countryId, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"country"` string would be concatenated with the `countryId` value, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object would be accessed using the `country` property, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
