Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `test` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the subsequent logic to be skipped if `test` is indeed a number, leading to unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `test` is explicitly `null`, which would bypass the logic intended for numeric values, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly when `test` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof test === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `test` is an object, which is a broader condition that would incorrectly allow non-numeric values to pass through, thus altering the intended flow of the function.

DONE.
