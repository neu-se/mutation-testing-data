  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, unhandledReasons.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, Math.floor(Math.random() * unhandledReasons.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove a random element from the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the second.

DONE.
