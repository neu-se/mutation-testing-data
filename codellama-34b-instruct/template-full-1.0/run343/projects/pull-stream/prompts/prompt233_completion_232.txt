  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator flips the boolean value of the expression, meaning that if `test` is true, `!test` would be false, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than `!`, so `test && false` would first evaluate to `false`, and then the `!` operator would flip the result to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than `!`, so `test || true` would first evaluate to `test`, and then the `!` operator would flip the result to `!test`.

DONE.
