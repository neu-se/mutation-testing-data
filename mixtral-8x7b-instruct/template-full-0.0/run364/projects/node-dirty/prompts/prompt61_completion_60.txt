 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.unlinkSync(this.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the file instead of closing the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream.unpipe()
```
This would result in different behavior because it stops the read stream from emitting data events, but does not close the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because it pauses the read stream, preventing further data from being read, but does not close the stream.

DONE.
