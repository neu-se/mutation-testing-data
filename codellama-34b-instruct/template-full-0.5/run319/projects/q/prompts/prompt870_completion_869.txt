  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(function() {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error after the `nfapply` method is called, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a resolved promise with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
