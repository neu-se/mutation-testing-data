  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `index` would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip over every other line in the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number would be added to the value of `index`, causing the `eachLine` method to iterate over the document in a seemingly random order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `index` would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate backwards through the document.

DONE.
