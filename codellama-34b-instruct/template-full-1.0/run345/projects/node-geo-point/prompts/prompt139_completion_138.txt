  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!adjust(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `adjust` function, which would cause the longitude value to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add PI to the result of the `adjust` function, which would cause the longitude value to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of the `adjust` function by 2, which would cause the longitude value to be incorrect.

DONE.
