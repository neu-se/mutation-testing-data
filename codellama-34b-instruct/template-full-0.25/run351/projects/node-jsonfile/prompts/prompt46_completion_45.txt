  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, while `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` takes a callback function as its third argument, while `fs.writeFile` takes an options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` takes an options object as its third argument, while `fs.writeFile` takes a string encoding as its third argument.

DONE.
