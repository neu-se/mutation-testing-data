  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected one, and would not propagate the rejection to the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a rejected promise with a different reason, and would propagate the rejection to the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a resolved promise with the original rejection value, and would not propagate the rejection to the returned promise.

DONE.
