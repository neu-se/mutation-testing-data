 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to zip the current directory instead of using the provided `src` path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when checking if `src` is a glob, potentially skipping the globbing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the empty string as a path, causing unexpected behavior in the `compress` method.

DONE.
