  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes || lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `attributes` property is checked for both `newOp` and `lastOp`, while in this new code, it only checks for `newOp`. This means that if `lastOp` has the `attributes` property, it will be ignored in the new code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes || newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `attributes` property is checked for both `newOp` and `lastOp`, while in this new code, it only checks for `lastOp`. This means that if `newOp` has the `attributes` property, it will be ignored in the new code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `attributes` property is checked
