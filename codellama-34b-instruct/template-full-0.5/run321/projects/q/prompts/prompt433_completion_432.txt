  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to always be called, regardless of the value of `trackUnhandledRejections`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to always be called, regardless of the value of `trackUnhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections == false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to never be called, regardless of the value of `trackUnhandledRejections`.

DONE.
