  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would be called with an additional argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would be called with a different set of options, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { timezones: [] })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would be called with a different set of timezones, which could cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
