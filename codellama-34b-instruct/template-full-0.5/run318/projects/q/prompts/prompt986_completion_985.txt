  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a method that sends a message to a node, while `send` is a method that sends a message to a node and expects a response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a method that sends a message to a node, while `get` is a method that retrieves a message from a node.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a method that sends a message to a node, while `put` is a method that sends a message to a node and updates the node's state.

DONE.
