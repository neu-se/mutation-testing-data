 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function is overwritten with an empty function, causing any errors to not be properly handled and propagated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nextTick(deferred.reject);
