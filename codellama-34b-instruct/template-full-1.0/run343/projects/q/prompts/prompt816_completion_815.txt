  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).progress()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.progress()` is a method that handles progress notifications for a promise's originating deferred, whereas `.done()` is a method that terminates a chain of promises and forces rejections to be thrown as exceptions. Using `.progress()` instead of `.done()` would change the way the promise is handled, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(0, null).done()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.timeout()` is a method that causes a promise to be rejected if it does not get fulfilled before some milliseconds time out. By setting the timeout to 0 milliseconds, the promise would be immediately rejected, causing any subsequent code to run. This would change the behavior of the program, as the `done()` method would no longer be called.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(10
