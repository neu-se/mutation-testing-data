  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `logHypot` would receive the same value for both `a` and `b`, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `logHypot` would receive a different value for `b`, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `logHypot` would receive a different value for `a` and `b`, which could cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
