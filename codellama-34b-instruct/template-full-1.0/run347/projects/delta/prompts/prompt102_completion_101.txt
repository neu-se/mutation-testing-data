  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the last element from the `ops` array, which may not be the same as the element that was inserted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `ops` array, which may not be the same as the element that was inserted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.ops.length - 1] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last element in the `ops` array with the new operation, which may not be the same as the previous element.

DONE.
