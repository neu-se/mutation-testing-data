  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object with no keys, while `Object.keys` returns an array containing the keys in a given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array containing all the strings that represent the property names of a given object, while `Object.keys` only returns the keys of a given object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` returns a string representing the object, while `Object.keys` returns an array containing the keys in a given object.

DONE.
