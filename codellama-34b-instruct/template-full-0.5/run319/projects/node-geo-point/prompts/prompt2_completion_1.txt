  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for latitude values outside of the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 && latitude > 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never allow for latitude values inside the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 && latitude > 90 || latitude == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for latitude values outside of the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees, and also allow for the value 0.

DONE.
