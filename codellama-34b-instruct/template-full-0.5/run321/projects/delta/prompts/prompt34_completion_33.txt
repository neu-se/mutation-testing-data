  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` could be an object, but `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` could be an object, but `null` is a primitive value and `typeof a` would return `'object'` if `a` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && !(a instanceof Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` could be an object, but `null` is a primitive value and `a instanceof Object` would return `false` if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
