 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => drain
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a function that returns the `drain` function instead of invoking it directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of arguments the `drain` function can accept instead of invoking it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `drain` function to a string instead of invoking it.

These changes would not produce a syntax error and would only be caught if the test suite includes checks for the expected behavior of the `onEnd` function. DONE.
