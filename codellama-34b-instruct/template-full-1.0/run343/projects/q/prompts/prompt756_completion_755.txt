  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` is a different function that returns a promise for an array of promises that are all rejected, while `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises that are all resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different function that returns the first resolved promise of an array, while `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises that are all resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
whenRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `whenRejected` is a different function that returns a promise for the rejection of an array of promises, while `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises that are all resolved.

DONE.
