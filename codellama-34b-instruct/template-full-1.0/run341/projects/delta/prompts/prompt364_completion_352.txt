  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
			Op.length(otherOp)
``` 
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the length of the other op with the length of the current op, which could result in incorrect calculation of the Delta's length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
			Op.length(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the length of the other op with the length of the current op, which could result in incorrect calculation of the Delta's length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
			0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the input, which could result in incorrect calculation of the Delta's length.

DONE.
