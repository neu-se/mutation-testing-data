  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method returns `true` if the given argument is a `Buffer` object, while the original code fragment returns `true` if the given argument is a `Buffer` object or a string that contains a `Buffer` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method returns a string representation of the given argument, while the original code fragment returns a string representation of the given argument if it is a `Buffer` object, or the original argument if it is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with the given argument replaced with the given replacement, while the original code fragment returns a new string with the given argument replaced with the given replacement if
