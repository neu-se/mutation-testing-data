  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would pass the `abort` signal to the `read` function, while the new code fragment `null` would pass a `null` value instead. This could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently, such as not aborting the read operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would pass the `abort` signal to the `read` function, while the new code fragment `undefined` would pass an `undefined` value instead. This could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently, such as not aborting the read operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abort"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would pass the `abort` signal to the `read` function, while the new code fragment `"abort
