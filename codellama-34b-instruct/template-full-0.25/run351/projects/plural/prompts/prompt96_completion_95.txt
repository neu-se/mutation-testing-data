  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is reversed, so it would replace "e" with "a" instead of "a" with "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is the same as the original code fragment, so it would replace "a" with "e" in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/[aeiou]/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern matches any vowel, so it would replace any vowel with "e" instead of just "a".

DONE.
