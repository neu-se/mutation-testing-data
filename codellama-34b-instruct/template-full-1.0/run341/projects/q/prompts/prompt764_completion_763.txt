  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never
```
This would result in different behavior because the `never` operator returns a promise that is never resolved, regardless of the result of the promise passed to it. In contrast, the `when` operator returns a promise that is resolved with the same value as the promise passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, so the `when` operator would throw an error. The `never` operator, on the other hand, would return a promise that is never resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`, while the original code fragment would return a promise that is resolved with the same value as the promise passed to it.

DONE.
