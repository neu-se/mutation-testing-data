  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the result, which would cause the algorithm to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the result, which would cause the algorithm to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the result, which would cause the algorithm to behave differently in certain edge cases.

DONE.
