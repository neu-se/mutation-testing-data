  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is not a number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is a finite number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is not zero, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

DONE.
