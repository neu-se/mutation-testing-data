  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `array[i++]` expression, while the modified code fragment returns the value of the `cb` function call. This could potentially cause issues if the `cb` function has side effects or if the `array[i++]` expression is not the intended return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `cb` function call, while the modified code fragment returns the value `true`. This could potentially cause issues if the `cb` function has side effects or if the `true` value is not the intended return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `abortCb` function call
