  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a function that returns the first resolved promise of an array, while `allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of states for the respective values, while `allResolved` returns a promise that is never rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of values, while `allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

DONE.
