  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the property of the object using the key as a variable, rather than accessing the key property directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the key variable, rather than accessing the property of the object using the key as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the key variable plus 1, rather than accessing the property of the object using the key as a string.

DONE.
