  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is converted to a number, which has different behavior than the original code where `abort` is used as a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is inverted, which changes the behavior of the `onAbort` function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is undefined, which throws an error when attempting to access the `null` property.

DONE.
