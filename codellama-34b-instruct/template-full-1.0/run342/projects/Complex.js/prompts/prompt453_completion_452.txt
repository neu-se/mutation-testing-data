  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the real part of `z` against the imaginary part of `this`, rather than the real part of `this` against the real part of `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the imaginary part of `z` against the real part of `this`, rather than the real part of `z` against the real part of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the sum of the imaginary part of `z` and the real part of `this`, rather than the difference between the real part of `z` and the real part of `this`.

DONE.
