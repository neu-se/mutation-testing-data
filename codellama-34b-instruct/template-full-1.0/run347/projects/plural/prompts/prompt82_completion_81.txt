  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting plural form would be incorrect (it should be "mice" not "mouses").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting plural form would be the same as the original (which is the correct plural form for "mouse").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting plural form would be an empty string (which is incorrect).

DONE.
