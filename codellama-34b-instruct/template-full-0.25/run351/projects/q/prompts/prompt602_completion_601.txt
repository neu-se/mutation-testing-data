  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of the original `object`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `undefined` instead of the original `object`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `object.foo` instead of the original `object`, which could potentially cause a different result if `object.foo` is not the same as `object`.

DONE.
