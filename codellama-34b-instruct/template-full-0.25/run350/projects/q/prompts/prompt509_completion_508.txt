  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, but if it is replaced with `null`, the `apply` method will be called with `null` as the `this` value, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, but if it is replaced with `undefined`, the `apply` method will be called with `undefined` as the `this` value, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
