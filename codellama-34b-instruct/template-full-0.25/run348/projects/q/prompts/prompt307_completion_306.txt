  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `Q` promise, which would resolve or reject the promise based on the result of the `answerPs[i]` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function(value) {
    resolve(value);
}, function(error) {
    reject(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `Q` promise, which would resolve or reject the promise based on the result of the `answerPs[i]` promise. Additionally, the `resolve` and `reject` functions would be called with the resolved or rejected value of the `answerPs[i]` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function(value) {
