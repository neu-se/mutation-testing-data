  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point['hasOwnProperty']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the property hasOwnProperty on the property 'type', rather than on the object 'point' itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable 'point' is of type object, rather than checking if it has the property 'type' with the value 'Point'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the property 'type' on the object 'point', rather than on the property 'type' itself.

DONE.
