  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
  throw new Error("something went wrong");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the fulfillment of the promise, but in this case, it throws an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
  return Q.reject("something went wrong");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the fulfillment of the promise, but in this case, it returns a rejected promise instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
  return Q.defer().resolve("something went wrong");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the fulfillment of the promise, but in this case, it returns a promise that is resolved with a string instead of the original value.
