  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, even if the input URL is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname == baseUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null only if the hostname of the input URL matches the hostname of the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(parsedUrl.hostname.includes(baseUrl.hostname))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null if the hostname of the input URL does not contain the hostname of the base URL.

DONE.
