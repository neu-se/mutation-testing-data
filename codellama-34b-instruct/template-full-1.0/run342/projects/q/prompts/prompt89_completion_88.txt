  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, "arguments"
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `call` would be the string "arguments", instead of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `call` would be `null`, instead of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `call` would be `NaN`, instead of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
