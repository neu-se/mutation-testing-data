  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [X]
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `get` to `X`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key, key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `get` method, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operator is replaced with `set`, which would change the behavior of the method.

DONE.
