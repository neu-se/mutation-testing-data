  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() { return undefined; }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function would be called with a function that returns `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function would be called with a function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("Test error")); }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function would be called with a function that returns
