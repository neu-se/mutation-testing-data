  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word instead of the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove any characters from the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word and then add a new character.

DONE.
