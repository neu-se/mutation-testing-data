  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would return `false` instead of `true` when the `Complex` object is created with a `NaN` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would return `true` instead of `false` when the `Complex` object is created with a `NaN` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would return `true` instead of `false` when the `Complex` object is created with a `NaN` value.

DONE.
