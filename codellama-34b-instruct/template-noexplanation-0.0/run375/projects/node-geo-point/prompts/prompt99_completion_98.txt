  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This change reverses the order of the coordinates, which could potentially cause issues with the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This change adds the coordinates together, which could also cause issues with the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This change multiplies the coordinates together, which could also cause issues with the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
