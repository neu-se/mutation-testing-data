  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method is being called on the wrong object. The `reverse` method should be called on the `parts` array, not the `spec` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method is being called on the wrong object. The `reverse` method should be called on the `parts` array, not the `spec` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse().slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is being called on the wrong object. The `slice` method should be called on the `parts` array, not the `spec` string.

DONE.
