  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arcus sinus of a different number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arcus sinus of 0, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arcus sinus of a different number than the original code.

DONE.
