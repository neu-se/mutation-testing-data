  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `path` and `ctx` variables to be concatenated instead of being passed as separate arguments to the `matches` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path - ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `path` and `ctx` variables to be subtracted instead of being passed as separate arguments to the `matches` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path * ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `path` and `ctx` variables to be multiplied instead of being passed as separate arguments to the `matches` method.

DONE.
