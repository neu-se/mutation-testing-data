  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, but the new code fragment uses 'https://' which would change the protocol to HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, but the new code fragment includes the baseUrlStr variable which could change the protocol to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(baseUrlStr, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, but the new code fragment uses the URL.resolve() method to resolve the baseUrlStr and 'http://' which could change the protocol to a different value.

DONE.
