  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` term would change the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c
2 * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` term would change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c
2 * a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` term would change the result of the expression.

DONE.
