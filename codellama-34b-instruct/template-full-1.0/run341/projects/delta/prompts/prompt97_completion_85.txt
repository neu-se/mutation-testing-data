  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prefer to insert first, even if the insertion would come before a deletion, which could result in the deletion being applied to the incorrect index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prefer to delete first, even if the deletion would come after an insertion, which could result in the insertion being undone by the deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly prefer to insert or delete, which could lead to unexpected and inconsistent behavior.

DONE.
