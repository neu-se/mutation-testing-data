  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(<empty function>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `close` method with an empty function as an argument, which would not wait for any callbacks to be executed, even if the queue is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(<null>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `close` method with `null` as an argument, which would not wait for any callbacks to be executed, even if the queue is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `close` method with an empty function as an argument, which would not wait for any callbacks to be executed, even if the queue is not empty.

DONE.
