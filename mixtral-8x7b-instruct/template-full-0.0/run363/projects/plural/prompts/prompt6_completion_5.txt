 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return `'object'` instead of the actual object type, which could lead to incorrect pluralization rules being applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would always return `'number'`, which would cause the `plural` function to always append an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of the pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[object String]'
