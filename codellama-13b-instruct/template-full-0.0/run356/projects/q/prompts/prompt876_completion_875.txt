  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `setTimeout` function as an array, rather than as individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `setTimeout` function as a single array, rather than as individual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to the `setTimeout` function, rather than the original arguments.

DONE.
