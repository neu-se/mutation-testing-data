  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation. Using `peekType()` in this context would result in the code attempting to use the type of the next operation as a length, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation. Using `peek()` in this context would result in the code attempting to use the entire operation as a length, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length` returns the number of operations in the iterator, while `peekLength()` returns the length of the next
