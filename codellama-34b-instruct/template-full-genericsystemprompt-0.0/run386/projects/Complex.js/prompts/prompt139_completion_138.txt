  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `Complex` object `z` is infinite, but it would not check if the `Complex` object `this` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `Complex` object `z` is infinite, but it would not check if the `Complex` object `a` is infinite.

DONE.
