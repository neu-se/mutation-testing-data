  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy` would become `null`, even if it was previously defined, which could cause errors in the `query` and `matches` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy` would become `undefined`, even if it was previously defined, which could cause errors in the `query` and `matches` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy: Policy = { name: "default", ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy` would become a new, hard-coded object with a different name and properties than the original `policy` object, which could cause errors in the `query` and `matches` methods.

DONE.
