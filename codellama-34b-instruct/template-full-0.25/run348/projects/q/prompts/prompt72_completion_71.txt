  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that is defined in the provided code snippet, but it is not the same as `flush`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a certain amount of time has passed, but the provided code snippet does not use `setTimeout`.

DONE.
