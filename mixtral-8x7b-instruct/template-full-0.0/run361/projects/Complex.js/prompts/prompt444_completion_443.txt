 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the default value from a number (0) to a non-number (NaN), which might cause unexpected results in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the default value from a number (0) to a very large number (Infinity), which might cause unexpected results in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the default value from the value of `places` to a constant (0), which might cause unexpected results in the calculations.

DONE.
