  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `z['im']` is not equal to zero, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 1
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `z['im']` is equal to one, which is a different condition than the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === z['re']
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `z['im']` is equal to `z['re']`, which is a different condition than the original behavior.

DONE.
