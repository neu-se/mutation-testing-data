  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is not defined in the function signature, and would cause a `ReferenceError` if the function is called with an object that does not have a `src` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dest` property to be converted to uppercase, which could potentially change the behavior of the `path.join()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dest` property to be split on the `.` character, and the first element of the resulting array would be used as the path. This could potentially change the behavior of the `path.join()` function if the `dest` property contains a file extension.

DONE.
