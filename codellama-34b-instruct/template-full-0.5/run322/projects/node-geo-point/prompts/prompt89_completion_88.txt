  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = asin(sinφ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `atan2` to calculate the arctangent of `y` and `x`, which is a more robust and accurate method for computing the arctangent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = acos(sinφ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `asin` to calculate the arctangent of `sinφ2`, which is a more robust and accurate method for computing the arctangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = atan2(sinφ2, cosφ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `atan2` to calculate the arctangent of `sinφ2` and `cosφ2`, which is a more robust and accurate method for computing the arctang
