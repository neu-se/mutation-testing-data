  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `define.amd` is a function and if it has a property called `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `define.amd` is a function and if it has a method called `test` that returns a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.test === "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `define.amd` is a function and if it has a property called `test` that is equal to the string `"test"`.

DONE.
