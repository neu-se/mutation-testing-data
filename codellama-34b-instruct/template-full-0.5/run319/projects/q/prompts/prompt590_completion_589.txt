  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `makeGenerator` is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context would be different, and the function `makeGenerator` would be called with a different `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be different, and the function `makeGenerator` would be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
