  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + cb
```
This would result in different behavior because a different value would be added to the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations would be reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && 1
```
This would result in different behavior because a different boolean expression would be evaluated.

DONE.
