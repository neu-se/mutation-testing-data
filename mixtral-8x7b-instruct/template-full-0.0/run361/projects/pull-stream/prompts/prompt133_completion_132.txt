 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the result of the `cb` function as an argument, while the modified version always passes `true` regardless of the `cb` function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { /* empty function */ })()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function, while the modified version does not call any function in its place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(cb, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function synchronously, while the modified version calls it asynchronously after a zero-millisecond delay.

DONE.
