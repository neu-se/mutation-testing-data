  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be passed as the third argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause the function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `getCountry` function, which would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected country object.

DONE.
