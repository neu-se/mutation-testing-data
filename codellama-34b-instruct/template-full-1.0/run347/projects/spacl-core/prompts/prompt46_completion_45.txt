  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method to check if `part` matches a certain pattern, but replacing it with `part.match(false)` would always return `null`, even if `part` does match the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!part.match
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method to check if `part` matches a certain pattern, but replacing it with `!part.match` would negate the result of the `match` method, so if `part` matches the pattern, it would return `null`, and if it doesn't match the pattern, it would return the matched part of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `match` method to check if `part` matches a
