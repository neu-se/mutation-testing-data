  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called on the wrong promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called on the already resolved promise, and not the deferred promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called on the deferred promise, rather than `become` being called on the resolved promise.

DONE.
