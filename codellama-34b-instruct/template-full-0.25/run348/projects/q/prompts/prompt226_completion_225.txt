  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument of the `promiseDispatch` function, which is the `resolve` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments of the `promiseDispatch` function, which are the `resolve` and `reject` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three arguments of the `promiseDispatch` function, which are the `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` functions.

DONE.
