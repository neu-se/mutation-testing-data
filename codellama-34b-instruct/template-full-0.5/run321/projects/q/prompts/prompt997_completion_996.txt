  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` method is not called, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to not be properly populated with the node resolver function, leading to unexpected behavior when the `Q.nsend` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` method is not called, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to not be properly populated with the node resolver function, leading to unexpected behavior when the `Q.nsend` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` method is not called, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to not be properly populated with the node resolver function, leading to unexpected behavior when the `Q.nsend` method is called.
