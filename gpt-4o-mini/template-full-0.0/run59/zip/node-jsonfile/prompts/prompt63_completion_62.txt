Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `toString()` as a method will convert the content to a string, while the original code simply references the function without invoking it, which would not convert the content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('ascii')
```
This would result in different behavior because specifying 'ascii' as an argument to `toString()` would convert the buffer to an ASCII string, potentially losing information if the original content contains non-ASCII characters, unlike the original code which uses the default 'utf8' encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('base64')
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the content to a base64 string would encode the binary data into a base64 representation, which is not the intended behavior of converting the buffer to a readable string format as done in the original code.

DONE.
