  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects the array of rules to be in the same order as they were passed in, but by reversing the array, the order of the rules is changed, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects the array of rules to be in the same order as they were passed in, but by creating a shallow copy of the array, the order of the rules is preserved, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.concat(<dummy rule>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects the array of rules to be in the same order as they were passed in, but by adding a new rule to the array, the order of the rules is changed, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
