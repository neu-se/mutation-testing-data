  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second argument `z` is infinite, rather than checking if the first argument `this` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first argument `this` is not infinite, rather than checking if it is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first argument `this` is not a number (NaN), rather than checking if it is infinite.

DONE.
