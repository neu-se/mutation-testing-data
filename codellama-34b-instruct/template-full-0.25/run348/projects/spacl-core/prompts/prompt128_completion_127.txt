  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand, whereas the `<` operator checks if the left operand is strictly less than the right operand. In this case, using `<=` would cause the loop to execute one extra time, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks if the left operand is strictly greater than the right operand, whereas the `<` operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand. In this case, using `>` would cause the loop to execute zero times, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 < count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the loop to execute one less time than it would with the original code fragment. This
