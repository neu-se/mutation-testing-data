  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isInfinite']` would return `true` if `z` is infinite, whereas `z['isZero']` would return `true` only if `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re'] === 0` would check if the real part of `z` is zero, whereas `z['isZero']` would check if both the real and imaginary parts of `z` are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['abs']()` would return the absolute value of `z`, whereas `z['isZero']` would check if both the real and imaginary parts of `z` are zero.

DONE.
