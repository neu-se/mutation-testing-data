Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow a string to be considered a valid input, leading to a TypeError being thrown when the code attempts to access properties of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `null` to pass the check, which would lead to a TypeError when trying to access properties on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly validate the input as an object only if it is an array, thus rejecting valid GeoJSON objects that are not arrays.

DONE.
