  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejection` variable, which is an error object. Replacing it with `null` would result in a different error message being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejection` variable, which is an error object. Replacing it with `undefined` would result in a different error message being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejection` variable, which is an error object. Replacing it with a new `Error` object would result in a different error message being thrown.

DONE.
