  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that raises an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise. In the context of the code, `throw` would cause the generator to stop iterating and propagate the exception to the caller, whereas `reject` would cause the promise returned by the generator to be rejected with the given value.
