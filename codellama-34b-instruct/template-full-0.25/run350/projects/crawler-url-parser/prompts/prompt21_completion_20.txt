  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http://` protocol, while the replacement code fragment uses the `https://` protocol. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `www.` subdomain, while the replacement code fragment does. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a specific domain, while the replacement code fragment includes the domain `example.com`. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

DONE.
