Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array when there are still operations left to iterate over, instead of returning the remaining operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is out of bounds instead of checking if there are more operations to process, potentially leading to incorrect results when there are still operations available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array if there is any offset, which is not the intended logic, as it should return remaining operations regardless of the offset.

DONE.
