  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite. This change would cause the `add`, `sub`, and `mul` methods to return different results when `this` is infinite, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
