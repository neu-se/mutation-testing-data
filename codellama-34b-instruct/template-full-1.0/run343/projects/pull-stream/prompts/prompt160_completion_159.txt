  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is semantically different from `null`, and may cause the program to behave differently when a value is expected or when a value is not expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is semantically different from `undefined`, and may cause the program to behave differently when a value is expected or when a value is not expected.
