  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is incremented by 1, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is decremented by 1, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, "invalid-id")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is set to an invalid value, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return `null` instead of a country object.

DONE.
