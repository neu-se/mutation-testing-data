  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would replace the last part of the path with a slash, regardless of whether it is a file or a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would replace the last part of the path with an empty string, regardless of whether it is a file or a directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, ".");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would replace the last part of the path with a dot, regardless of whether it is a file or a directory.
