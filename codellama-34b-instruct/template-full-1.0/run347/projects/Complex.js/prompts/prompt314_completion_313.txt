  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new term `a` into the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of `b` in the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the magnitude of `b` in the expression.

DONE.
