  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the same set of strings as the original code fragment. The original code fragment matches any string that contains an `@` symbol followed by a space, a filename, a colon, and a line number. The modified code fragment matches any string that contains an `@` symbol followed by a space, a filename, a colon, and a line number, with the filename containing at least one character that is not a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the same set of strings as the original code fragment. The original code fragment matches any string that contains an `@` symbol followed by a space, a filename, a colon, and a line number. The modified code fragment matches any string that contains an `@` symbol at the beginning of the line, followed by a space, a filename, a colon, and
