Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the second argument from `true` to `false` alters the way the URL is parsed, specifically affecting the `slashesDenoteHost` option, which can lead to incorrect parsing of URLs that contain slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(currentUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `URL.format` instead of `URL.parse` would attempt to format the `currentUrlStr` as a URL string rather than parsing it, which would not provide the expected URL object structure needed for further processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the third argument from `true` to `false` disables the `parseQueryString` option, meaning that the query string will not be parsed into an object, which could lead to incorrect handling of query parameters later in the code.

DONE.
