  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the `push` method to always push the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, even if the `index` is less than the length of the array. This would lead to unexpected behavior when the `ops` array is not empty and the `push` method is called with an `index` that is less than the length of the array.
