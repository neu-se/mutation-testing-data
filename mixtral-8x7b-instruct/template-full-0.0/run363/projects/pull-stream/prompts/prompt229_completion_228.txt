 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an empty string, instead of using the `tester` function which could have any arbitrary behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns false, ignoring the input and the `tester` function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number, instead of using the `tester` function which could have a consistent and predictable behavior.

DONE.
