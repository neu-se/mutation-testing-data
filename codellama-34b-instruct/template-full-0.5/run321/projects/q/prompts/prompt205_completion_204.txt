  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt2[2];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third capture group of the regular expression, which is the column number, instead of the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt3[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first capture group of the regular expression, which is the filename, instead of the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt1[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first capture group of the regular expression, which is the function name, instead of the second capture group, which is the line number.

DONE.
