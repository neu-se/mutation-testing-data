  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    if (err) {
        deferred.reject(err);
    } else {
        deferred.resolve(value);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver` which is a different function that returns a different resolver.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.resolve` instead of `deferred.reject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not use `.bind`.

DONE.
