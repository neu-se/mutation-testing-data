  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` will resolve the promise, whereas `deferred.reject` will reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will generate an unhandled error, whereas `deferred.reject` will reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this expression will evaluate to 2, which is a valid value that can be resolved as a promise, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that will throw an error when called.

DONE.
