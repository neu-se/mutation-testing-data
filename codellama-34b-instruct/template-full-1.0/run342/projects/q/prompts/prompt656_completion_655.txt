  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"DUMMY"
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns an array of elements from a specified start position to the end of the array. Using the string "DUMMY" would cause the dispatch method to fail, as it expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"DUMMY".length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns an array of elements from a specified start position to the end of the array. Using the return value of the length property of the string "DUMMY" would cause the dispatch method to receive a different argument, which could cause the method to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns an array of elements from a specified start position to the end of the array. Using the constant 0 would cause the dispatch method
