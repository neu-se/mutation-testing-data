  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This will cause the promise to resolve instead of reject, which will result in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This will cause the promise to notify instead of reject, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This will cause the promise to create a new node resolver instead of rejecting, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
