  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one character ahead of the original code, potentially causing the `indexOf` method to return a different index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one character behind the original code, potentially causing the `indexOf` method to return a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 2` would cause the `start` variable to be two characters ahead of the original code, potentially causing the `indexOf
