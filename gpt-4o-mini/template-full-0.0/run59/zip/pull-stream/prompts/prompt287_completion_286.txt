Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the original data by adding 1 to it, which changes the output even when `end` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `null` regardless of the value of `data`, which would lead to loss of the actual data being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the original data by 2, altering the output and potentially leading to unexpected results in the consuming code.

DONE.
