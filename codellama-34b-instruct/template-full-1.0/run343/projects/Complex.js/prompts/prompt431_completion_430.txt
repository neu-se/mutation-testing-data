  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER cant be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is addition instead of multiplication.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER cant be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because its using the imaginary part instead of the real part.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER cant be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * places
```
This would result in different behavior because its using a random value instead of the actual value to multiply.
DONE.
