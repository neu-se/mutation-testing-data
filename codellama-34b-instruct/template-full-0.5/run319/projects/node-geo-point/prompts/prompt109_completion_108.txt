  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `Math.pow` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `x` and `y` coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `Math.pow` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `x` and `y` coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `Math.pow` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `x` and `y` coordinates.

DONE.
