  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the `href` and `baseUrlStr` arguments in the opposite order than the original code fragment. In the original code fragment, `parse` is called with `href` as the first argument and `baseUrlStr` as the second argument, but in the modified code fragment, `parse` is called with `baseUrlStr` as the first argument and `href` as the second argument. This could potentially cause the `parse` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
