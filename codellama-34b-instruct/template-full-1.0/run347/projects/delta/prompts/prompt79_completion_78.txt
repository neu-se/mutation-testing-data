  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value of `lastOp.delete` is a number and `newOp.insert` is not null, while this new code checks if `lastOp.delete` is equal to `newOp.insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'string' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the type of `lastOp.delete` is a number, while this new code checks if it is a string. Additionally, this new code checks if `newOp.insert` is not null, while the original code does not check for this.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === newOp.insert && typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value of `lastOp.
