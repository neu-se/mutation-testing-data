 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `trim` method on an empty string, which is a no-op and will always return an empty string. The original code fragment calls `trim` on the text content of the `a` element, which could potentially have leading or trailing whitespace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null.trim()
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123.trim()
```
This would result in a `TypeError` being thrown, because numbers do not have a `trim` method. This option is similar to option 2, but highlights the fact that the `text` method of a
