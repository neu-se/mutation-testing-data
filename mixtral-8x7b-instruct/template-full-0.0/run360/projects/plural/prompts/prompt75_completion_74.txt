 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice' && 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string 'die', while the modified code fragment is a boolean expression that always evaluates to 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice' || 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string 'die', while the modified code fragment is a boolean expression that always evaluates to 'dice'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice' ? 'die' : 'six'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string 'die', while the modified code fragment is a ternary expression that evaluates to 'die' only when the condition is true, otherwise it evaluates to 'six'.

DONE.
