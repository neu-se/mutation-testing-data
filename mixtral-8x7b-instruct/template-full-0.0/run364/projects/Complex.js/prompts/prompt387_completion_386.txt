 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(-2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the negative exponential of twice the real part of the complex number, instead of the positive exponential of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / cosh(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine of twice the real part of the complex number, instead of the hyperbolic cosine of the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
