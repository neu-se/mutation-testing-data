  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if its length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if its first element is undefined.

DONE.
