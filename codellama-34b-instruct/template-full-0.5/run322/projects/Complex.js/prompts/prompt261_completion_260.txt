  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to use the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `b` variable, which could cause the `logHypot` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `a` and `b` variables together, which could cause the `logHypot` function to return a different result.

DONE.
