 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'undefined' would be passed to `stringify` instead of the actual object, causing the output to differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` handles `null` differently than an object, causing the output to differ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` expects an object as its first argument, and `this` might not always refer to the expected object, causing the function to fail or produce different output.

DONE.
