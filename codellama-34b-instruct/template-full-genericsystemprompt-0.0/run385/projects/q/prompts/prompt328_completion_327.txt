  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return _fulfilled(value);
}, function (exception) {
    return _rejected(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the `promise` object, which would execute the callback functions `_fulfilled` and `_rejected` in a different context than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return _rejected(value);
}, function (exception) {
    return _fulfilled(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the `promise` object, but the callback functions `_rejected` and `_fulfilled` would be called with the arguments in reverse order than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
