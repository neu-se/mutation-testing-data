  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.indexOf)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method is not the same as the `slice` method, and it would not produce the same output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.reduce)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is not the same as the `slice` method, and it would not produce the same output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.map)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is not the same as the `slice` method, and it would not produce the same output.

DONE.
