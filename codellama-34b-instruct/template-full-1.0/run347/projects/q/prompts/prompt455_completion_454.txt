  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the check for unhandled rejections altogether, leading to the possibility of uncaught rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is strictly equal to `true`, even though it should be checking if it is truthy. This could lead to unhandled rejections not being tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is not strictly equal to `false`, even though it should be checking if it is truthy. This could lead to unhandled rejections not being tracked.

DONE.
