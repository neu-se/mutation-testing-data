 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error-first callback `cb` would always receive an error value, even when there is no error. This is different from the original behavior where `cb` is called without arguments when there is no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the callback `cb` would be `undefined` instead of the actual data. This is different from the original behavior where `cb` is called with the data when the item passes the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument `ended` is passed to the callback `cb`. This is different from the original behavior where `cb` is called with two arguments at most.

DONE.
