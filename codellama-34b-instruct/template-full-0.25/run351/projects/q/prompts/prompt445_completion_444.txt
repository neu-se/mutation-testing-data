  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be null, and the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

DONE.
