  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `args` array onto the `messages` array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the `args` array as its argument, rather than the individual elements of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first element of the `args` array onto the `messages` array, rather than the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the second element of the `args` array onto the `messages` array, rather than the entire `args` array.

DONE.
