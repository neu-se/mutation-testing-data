  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the value of `x` and `y`, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the value of `x` and `y` with a different base and exponent. This would result in different values for `x` and `y`, which would in turn affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the value of `x` and `y`, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the value of `x` and `y` with a different base and exponent. This would result in different values for `x` and `y`, which would in turn affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3:
