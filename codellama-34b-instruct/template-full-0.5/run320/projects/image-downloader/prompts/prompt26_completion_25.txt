  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` function is called with the `options.url` argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` function is called with the `options.url` argument and the `POST` method, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.put(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` function is called with the `options.url` argument and the `PUT` method, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
