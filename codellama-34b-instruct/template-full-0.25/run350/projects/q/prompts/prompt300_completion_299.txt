  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([this, that])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` expects an array of promises, but `this` and `that` are not promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([this.promise, that.promise])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` expects an array of promises, but `this.promise` and `that.promise` are not promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([this.promise(), that.promise()])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` expects an array of promises, but `this.promise()` and `that.promise()` are not promises.

DONE.
