  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, so the pattern will only match characters that are lowercase, not uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, so the pattern will match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, so the pattern will only match characters that are lowercase, not uppercase.

DONE.
