  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `apply` method is called on `Q.denodeify`, which expects a function in the first argument, but if the placeholder is replaced with `null`, it will throw a `TypeError` because `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `apply` method is called on `Q.denodeify`, which expects a function in the first argument, but if the placeholder is replaced with `undefined`, it will throw a `TypeError` because `undefined` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `apply` method is called on `Q.denodeify`, which expects a function in the first argument, but if the placeholder is replaced with a function that takes no arguments
