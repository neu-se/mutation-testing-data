  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite. This change would cause the `div` function to return a different result in some cases, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
