  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` would fulfill the promise with a value, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with an unexpected value.

DONE.
