  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value associated with the key, even if the key is not present in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) || key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key if it is present in the map, and the key itself if it is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key plus 1, even if the key is not present in the map.

DONE.
