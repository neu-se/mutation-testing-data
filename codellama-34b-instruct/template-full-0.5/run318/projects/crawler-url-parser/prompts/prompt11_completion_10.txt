  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail if the input string contains a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the code to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the code to perform a case-insensitive match, which could cause the code to fail if the input string contains a forward slash in uppercase.

DONE.
