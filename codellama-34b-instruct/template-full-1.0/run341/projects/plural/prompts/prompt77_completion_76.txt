  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `1` is not a function, so the `define` function would not be called, and the `plural` method would not be added to the `String` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is a function, but it does not return any value, so the `plural` method would not be added to the `String` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', function(word, num) { return word + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is a function that returns the input word with an `s` appended to it, regardless of the input number, so the `plural` method would not be added to the `String` prototype.
