  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `op.retain === 'number'` This would result in different behavior because the original code would retain attributes if `op.retain` is a number, but this code would only retain attributes if `op.retain` is a number and `op.attributes` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `op.retain === null` This would result in different behavior because the original code would retain attributes if `op.retain` is a number, but this code would only retain attributes if `op.retain` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `op.retain === undefined` This would result in different behavior because the original code would retain attributes if `op.retain` is a number, but this code would only retain attributes if `op.retain` is `undefined`.

DONE.
