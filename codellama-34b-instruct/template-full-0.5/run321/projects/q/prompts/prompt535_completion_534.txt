  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `0` would cause the `spread` method to fail, leading to a rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `undefined` would cause the `spread` method to fail, leading to a rejection of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `null` would cause the `spread` method to fail, leading to a rejection of the promise.

DONE.
