  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the original function's `this` context. In this case, `uncurryThis` is being called with `Array.prototype.slice` as an argument, which is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. By calling `uncurryThis` with `Array.prototype.slice`, we are effectively creating a new function that is bound to the `Array.prototype.slice` function's `this` context, which is the `Array.prototype` object. This means that when the new function is called, it will be called with the `Array.prototype` object as its `this` context, rather than the original `this` context of the `Array.prototype.slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.map)
