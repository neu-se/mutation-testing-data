  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `nextOp` to be an object, but `null` is not an object and will cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `nextOp` to be an object, but `undefined` is not an object and will cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `nextOp` to have certain properties and methods, but an empty object does not have those properties and methods, and will cause a runtime error.

DONE.
