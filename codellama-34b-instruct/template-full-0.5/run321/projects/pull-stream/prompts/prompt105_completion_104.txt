  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it is not equivalent to `null`. If the code is expecting a null value, it may not handle the undefined value correctly, leading to a test failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it is not equivalent to `null`. If the code is expecting a null value, it may not handle the zero value correctly, leading to a test failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string, and it is not equivalent to `null`. If the code is expecting a null value, it may not handle the empty string value correctly, leading to a test failure.

DONE.
