  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
