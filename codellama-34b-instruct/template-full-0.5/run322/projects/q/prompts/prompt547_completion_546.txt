  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolve" is a different function than "reject", and it would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("some error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("some error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the original code, and it would use the Q library's reject function instead of the native Promise reject function.

DONE.
