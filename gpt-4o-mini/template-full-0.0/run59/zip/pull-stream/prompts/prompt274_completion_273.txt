Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` converts the input into an array, which may not be compatible with the expected stream behavior, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected results when the stream is processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `map` on the stream assumes that the stream is an array or array-like object, which may not be the case, leading to a TypeError if `stream` is not iterable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because wrapping the stream in a Promise changes the way the data is handled, potentially causing the stream to be treated asynchronously, which could disrupt the expected synchronous flow of the stream processing.

DONE.
