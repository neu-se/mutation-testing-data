  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which is case-sensitive. By calling `toLowerCase()` on the `baseUrlStr` variable, the resulting URL will be in lowercase, which may cause the `URL.parse()` method to interpret the URL differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which is case-sensitive. By calling `toUpperCase()` on the `baseUrlStr` variable, the resulting URL will be in uppercase, which may cause the `URL.parse()` method to interpret the URL differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the
