  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
