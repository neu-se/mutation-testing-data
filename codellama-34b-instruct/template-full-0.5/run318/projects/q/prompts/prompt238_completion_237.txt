  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nearer(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` object does not have a `nearer` method, and the code would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.nearer(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise` class does not have a `nearer` method, and the code would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

DONE.
