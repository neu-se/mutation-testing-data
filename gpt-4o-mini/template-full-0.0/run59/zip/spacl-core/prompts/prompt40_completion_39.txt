Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter used for splitting the `spec` string from the default (which is '/') to a comma, potentially leading to incorrect path segment parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/./g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to match every character in the `spec` string instead of splitting it into segments, which would not produce the expected array of path components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter to a space, which is unlikely to be present in valid path specifications, leading to an array with a single element (the entire `spec` string) if no spaces are found.

DONE.
