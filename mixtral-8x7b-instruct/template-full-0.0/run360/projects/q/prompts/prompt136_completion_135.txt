 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration` or `QReturnValue`. By replacing `<PLACEHOLDER>` with `null`, the `typeof` check will return "object" and the `instanceof` check will fail, causing the function to return `false` even for `StopIteration` instances.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration` or `QReturnValue`. By replacing `<PLACEHOLDER>` with `{}`, the `instanceof` check will fail, causing the function to return `false` even for `StopIteration` instances.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new String("StopIteration")
