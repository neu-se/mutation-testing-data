 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'incorrect_id'
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned timezone would have an incorrect id, which might not match any expected values in the tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned timezone would have a random id, which would not match any expected values in the tests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'id'.repeat(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned timezone would have a repeated and longer id, which would not match any expected values in the tests.

By introducing these changes, the test suite should fail, indicating that the tests are checking for specific behavior and are not simply testing for the presence of output. DONE.
