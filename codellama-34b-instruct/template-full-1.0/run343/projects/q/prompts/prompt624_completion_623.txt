  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, which will cause the `Promise.all` method to return a rejected promise even if all the promises passed to it are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise, which will cause the `Promise.all` method to return a resolved promise even if all the promises passed to it are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.get` returns the value of a property in a future turn, which may be different from the original value returned by `Q.all`.

DONE.
