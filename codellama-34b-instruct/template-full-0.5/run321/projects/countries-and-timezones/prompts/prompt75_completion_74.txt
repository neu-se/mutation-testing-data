  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, 'invalid-name'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, as the `name` parameter would not match any of the available timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name + 'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a name that is not in the original data, which could cause issues in other parts of the code that rely on the correct timezone names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a name that is not in the original data, which could cause issues in other parts of the code that rely on the correct timezone names.

DONE.
