  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert a zero value instead of the intended content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = thisOp.retain ? thisOp.retain : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the retain value from the other op, potentially resulting in invalid data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = thisOp.insert ? otherOp.insert : thisOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the insert value from the other op, potentially resulting in invalid data.

DONE.
