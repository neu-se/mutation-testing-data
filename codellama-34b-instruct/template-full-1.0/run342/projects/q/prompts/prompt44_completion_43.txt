  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "hello", even if the previous code had returned a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, even if the previous code had returned a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw a division by zero error, even if the previous code had returned a different value.

DONE.
