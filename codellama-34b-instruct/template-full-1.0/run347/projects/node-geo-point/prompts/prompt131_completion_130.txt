  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the sign of the `zoom` variable, which could potentially cause issues with the calculations being performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the `zoom` variable, which could cause the calculations to be performed at a different scale.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom*zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the value of the `zoom` variable, which could cause the calculations to be performed at a different rate.

DONE.
