  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns "indexes" for words that end with "index", while the new code fragment returns "ices" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns "appendices" for words that end with "appendix", while the new code fragment returns "ices" instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns "criteria" for words that end with "criterion", while the new code fragment returns "ices" instead.
