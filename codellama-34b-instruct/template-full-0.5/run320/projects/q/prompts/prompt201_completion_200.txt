  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because "\r" is a carriage return character, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a carriage return character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\f"
```
This would result in different behavior because "\f" is a form feed character, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a form feed character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\v"
```
This would result in different behavior because "\v" is a vertical tab character, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a vertical tab character instead of a newline character.

DONE.
