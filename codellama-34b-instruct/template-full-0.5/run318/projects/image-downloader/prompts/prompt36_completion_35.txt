  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a write stream to a different file than the one specified in the `dest` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append to the file instead of overwriting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w+' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a write stream with read and write permissions, which could allow for unintended data corruption.

DONE.
