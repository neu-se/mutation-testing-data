  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `onAbort` argument, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function without the `onAbort` argument, which is present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with `null` as the second argument, which is different from the `abort` argument in the original code.

DONE.
