  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and add "ices" to the end, while this code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and add "ices" to the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and add "ices" to the end, while this code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and add "es" to the end.
