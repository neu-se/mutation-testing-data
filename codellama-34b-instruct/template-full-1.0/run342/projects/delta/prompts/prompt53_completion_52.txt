  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!handler.hasOwnProperty('compose')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `compose` method exists on the `handler` object, rather than checking if the `handler` object is not nullish.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `handler` object is null, rather than checking if it is nullish.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `handler` object is not a function, rather than checking if it is nullish.

DONE.
