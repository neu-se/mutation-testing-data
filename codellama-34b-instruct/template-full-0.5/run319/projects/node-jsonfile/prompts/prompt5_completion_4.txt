  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and it may not be a valid encoding for the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'utf8'` is a specific encoding, and it may not be the same as the encoding used by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding || 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different fallback encoding than the original code, and it may not be the same as the encoding used by the original code.

DONE.
