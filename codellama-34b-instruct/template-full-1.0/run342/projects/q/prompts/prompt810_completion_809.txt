  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is a reference to the Q library, whereas replacing it with null would mean that any subsequent code that relies on the Q library would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is a reference to the Q library, whereas replacing it with a number would mean that any subsequent code that relies on the Q library would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is a reference to the Q library, whereas replacing it with a string would mean that any subsequent code that relies on the Q library would fail.

DONE.
