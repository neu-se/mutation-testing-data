  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip over some of the remaining operations in the `otherIter` iterator, potentially causing the diff result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to add an extra operation to the `retDelta` object, potentially causing the result of the `diff()` function to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always add the current operation to `retDelta`, regardless of whether it should be added or not, potentially causing the result of the `diff()` function to be incorrect.

DONE.
