  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" to be pluralized as "people", while the new code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" to be pluralized as "peoples".

DONE.
