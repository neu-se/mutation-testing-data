  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function is called with the `point` argument, which is an object with `type` and `coordinates` properties. In the original code, the `isObject` function is called with the `point` argument, which is a `Point` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` property of the `point` object is compared to the string `'Point'`. In the original code, the `type` property is compared to the string `'Point'`, but the comparison is done using the `isObject` function, which is not the same as comparing the `type` property to the string `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinates` property of the `point`
