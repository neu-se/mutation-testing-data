  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is an object, and assigning it to a new object would change its reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is an object, and assigning it to a function would change its reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is an object, and assigning it to a number would change its reference.

DONE.
