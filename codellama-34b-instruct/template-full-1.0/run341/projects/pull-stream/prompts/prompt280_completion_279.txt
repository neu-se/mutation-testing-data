  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e => e + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` returns the input value unchanged, while the new fragment `e => e + 1` returns the input value incremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e => null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` returns the input value unchanged, while the new fragment `e => null` returns null for any input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e => e.x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` returns the input value unchanged, while the new fragment `e => e.x` returns the value of the `x` property of the input value. If the input value has no such property, the original code would throw an error, while the new code would return `undefined`.

DONE.
