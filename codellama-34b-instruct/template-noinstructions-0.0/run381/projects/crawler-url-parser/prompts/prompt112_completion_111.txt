  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrl` is defined before using it, but this replacement would cause `currentUrl` to be `null`, which would cause the code to throw an error when trying to access its `url` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `currentUrl` to be a URL object, but this replacement would cause `currentUrl` to be a string, which would cause the code to throw an error when trying to access its `url` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = { url: "http://example.com" };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `currentUrl` to be a URL object, but this replacement would cause `currentUrl` to be an object with a `url
