  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if there are any messages, regardless of whether the promise is resolved or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if the promise is not resolved, regardless of whether there are any messages or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if there are any messages, regardless of whether the promise is resolved or not.

DONE.
