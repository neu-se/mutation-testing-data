  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the keys of both objects, whereas the original code fragment only concatenated the keys of the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).filter(key => b[key] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include keys that are present in both objects, whereas the original code fragment included all keys from both objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).map(key => b[key] === undefined ? null : b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map the values of the `b` object to the keys of the `a` object, whereas the original code fragment only concatenated the keys of the `b` object.

DONE.
