  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nextOp` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `Op.length()` method would throw an error when called with `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nextOp` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value. The `Op.length()` method would throw an error when called with `undefined` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nextOp` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object. The `Op.length()` method would return 0 when called with an empty object as an argument, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed.

DONE.
