  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` object. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific implementation of the `Q` and `Promise` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` object.
