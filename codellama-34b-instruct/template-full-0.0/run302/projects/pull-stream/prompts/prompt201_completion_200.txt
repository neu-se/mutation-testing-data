  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `prop`, which is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of the object it is called on. In the original code, `prop` is called on the `map` function, which is passed as an argument to the `asyncMap` function. If `map` is not a function, then `prop` will return `undefined`, and the `asyncMap` function will return the `id` function. By negating the value of `prop`, we are essentially checking if `prop` is not a function, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.call(null)` will call the `prop` function with `null` as the `this` value, which is different from the original behavior where `prop` is called on the `map` function.

Option 3: The PL
