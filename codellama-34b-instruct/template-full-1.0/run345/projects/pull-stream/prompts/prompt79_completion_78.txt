  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` function to be called recursively, which could lead to a stack overflow error in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` function to return immediately, without calling the `read()` function, which could cause the program to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` function to return immediately, without calling the `read()` function, which could cause the program to hang or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
