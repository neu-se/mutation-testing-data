  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(__dirname, options.dest).ALTText
```
This would result in different behavior because the ".ALTText" property is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(options.dest, __dirname).join('path', 'to', 'file.txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the "join" method takes a different number of arguments and the resulting path would be different than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(options.dest, __dirname).extname
```
This would result in different behavior because the "extname" method returns the extension of the file name, but the original code fragment does not use this method.

DONE.
