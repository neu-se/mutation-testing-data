  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "errback"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise chain to be rejected with the string "errback", instead of handling the rejection with the `errback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise chain to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`, instead of handling the rejection with the `errback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(0)(errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise chain to be rejected with the return value of the callback function, instead of handling the rejection with the `errback` function.

DONE.
