  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl = linkurl.replace(/^https?:\/\/(www\.)?/i, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment extracts the protocol and hostname from the URL, but this modified code fragment simply removes the protocol and 'www.' subdomain from the URL, potentially leading to differences in the extracted URL components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.replace(/\/$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a trailing slash to the URL, but this modified code fragment removes any trailing slash, potentially leading to differences in the extracted URL components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the trailing '/index.html' or similar from the URL, but this modified code fragment removes any trailing '/' and an optional file extension,
