  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined`, which would break the `inspect` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to a string, even if `Q.longStackSupport` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to a string, even if `Q.longStackSupport` is true.

DONE.
