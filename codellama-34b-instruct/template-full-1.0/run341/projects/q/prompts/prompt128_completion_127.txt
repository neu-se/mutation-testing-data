  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the object property at the next index instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1 in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the property exists at the next index instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key] = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to undefined instead of checking if it exists.

DONE.
