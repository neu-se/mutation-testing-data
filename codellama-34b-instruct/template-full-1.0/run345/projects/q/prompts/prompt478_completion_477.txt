  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method would not remove any elements from the array, since the `at` variable is initialized to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method would remove one element from the end of the array, since the `at` variable is initialized to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method would remove all elements from the array starting from the last element, since the `at` variable is initialized to the length of the array.

DONE.
