  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the verb is not in the verbs object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs && this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the verb is in the verbs object and the corresponding value is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs && !this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the verb is in the verbs object and the corresponding value is false.

DONE.
