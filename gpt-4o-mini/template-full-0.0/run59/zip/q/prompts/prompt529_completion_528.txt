Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` function to always return a state of "fulfilled" instead of "rejected", regardless of the actual state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to the `inspect` function returning an object with an undefined reason, which could mislead users into thinking the promise was fulfilled without any issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + " error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the reason returned in the `inspect` function, appending " error" to the original reason, which could change the interpretation of the rejection reason in the promise handling.

DONE.
