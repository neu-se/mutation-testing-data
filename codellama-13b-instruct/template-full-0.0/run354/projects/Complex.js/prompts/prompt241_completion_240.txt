  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the exponential of the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the exponential of the complex number itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the exponential of the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the exponential of the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['re'] + this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the exponential of the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the exponential of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

DONE.
