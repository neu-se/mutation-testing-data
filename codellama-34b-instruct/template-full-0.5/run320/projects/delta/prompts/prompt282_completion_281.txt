  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the variable `a` to 10, which could cause the program to behave differently in other parts of the code that rely on the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the variable `a` to 5, which could cause the program to behave differently in other parts of the code that rely on the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new variable `b` with a value of 10, which could cause the program to behave differently in other parts of the code that rely on the value of `b`.

DONE.
