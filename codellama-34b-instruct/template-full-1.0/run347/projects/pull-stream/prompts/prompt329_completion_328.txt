  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op+1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op+1` would cause the function to always return `true`, regardless of the value of `op`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op-1` would cause the function to always return `false`, regardless of the value of `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because `!op` would cause the function to return the opposite of the original value of `op`, which could produce unexpected results.

DONE.
