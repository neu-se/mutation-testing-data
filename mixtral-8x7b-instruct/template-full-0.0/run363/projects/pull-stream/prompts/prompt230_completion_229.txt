 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return the opposite result, potentially causing tests that expect a certain output to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the test function to a string, which would not have the same behavior as the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, causing the function to never stop reading data.

DONE.
