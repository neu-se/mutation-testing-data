  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
console.log(`Random message: ${op.insert}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not log any messages, while this new code fragment logs a random message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
op.insert = 'Hello World'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `op.insert` attribute, while this new code fragment assigns a new value to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
delete op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assumes that `op.insert` exists, while this new code fragment deletes it.

DONE.
