 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `round` method would use a different constant for calculating the places value, which could lead to different rounding results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division by zero error, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `this['im']` property instead of the local variable `b` for calculating the denominator in the `round` method, which could lead to different results if the `this['im']` property has a different value than the local variable `b`.

DONE.
