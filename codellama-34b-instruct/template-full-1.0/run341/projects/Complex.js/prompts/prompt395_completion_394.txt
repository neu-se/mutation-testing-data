  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because "Math.sin" is not the same as "Math.cos", and using "Math.sin" would return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because "Math.cosh" is not the same as "Math.sin", and using "Math.cosh" would return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because "Math.tan" is not the same as "Math.sin", and using "Math.tan" would return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
