  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different operation than `delete`, and it would cause the `Delta` object to retain the specified number of characters instead of deleting them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more character than the original code, which could cause the `Delta` object to have a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one fewer character than the original code, which could cause the `Delta` object to have a different length.

DONE.
