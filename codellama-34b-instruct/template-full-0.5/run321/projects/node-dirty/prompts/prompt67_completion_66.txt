  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an intentional error to be thrown when the write stream is closed, which would likely cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be destroyed without an error, which could cause the test suite to pass even if there are issues with the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be destroyed with a null error, which could cause the test suite to pass even if there are issues with the database.

DONE.
