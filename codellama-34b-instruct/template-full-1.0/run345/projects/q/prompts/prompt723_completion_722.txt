  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof promise === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `IsPromise` checks if the given value is a promise, while `typeof === "object"` only checks if the value is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `IsPromise` checks if the given value is a promise, while `!promise` checks if the value is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise instanceOf Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `IsPromise` checks if the given value is a promise, while `instanceOf Promise` checks if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
