  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include any additional segments after the last one, whereas the original `flatten()` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include any additional segments after the last one, whereas the original `flatten()` would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include any additional segments after the last one, and it would also not include the initial slash, whereas the original `flatten()` would include both.

DONE.
