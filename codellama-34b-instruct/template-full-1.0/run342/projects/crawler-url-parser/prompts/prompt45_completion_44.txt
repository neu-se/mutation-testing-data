  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the `baseUrlStr` in the parsed URL, which would change the value of `ret.baseurl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the `baseUrlStr` in the parsed URL, which would change the value of `ret.baseurl`, and it would also not include the trailing `/` in the URL, which could change the behavior of the `URL.resolve` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the `baseUrlStr` in the parsed URL, which would change the value of `ret.baseurl`, and it would also not include the trailing `/` in the URL, which could change the behavior of the `URL.resolve` function.

DONE.
