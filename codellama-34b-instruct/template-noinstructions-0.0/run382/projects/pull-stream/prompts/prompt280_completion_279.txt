  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function that takes one argument, but `mapper(null)` would call the function with `null` as the argument, which may not be what the function is designed to handle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function that takes one argument, but `mapper(undefined)` would call the function with `undefined` as the argument, which may not be what the function is designed to handle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a function that takes one argument, but `mapper(0)` would call the function with `0` as the argument, which may not be what the function is designed to handle.

DONE.
