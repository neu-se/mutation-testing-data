  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the `dest` property of the options object, which may not be intended and could cause problems if the file being requested is not located in the correct directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `dest` property of the options object, which may not be intended and could cause problems if the file being requested is not located in the correct directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace('foo', 'bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of the string 'foo' with 'bar' in the `dest` property of the options object, which may not be intended and could cause problems if the file being requested is not located in the correct directory.

DONE.
