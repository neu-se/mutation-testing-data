  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value (null) rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a promise, rather than the original value.

DONE.
