  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `value`, which would cause the `thenResolve` method to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `value`, which would cause the `thenResolve` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `value` by 2, which would cause the `thenResolve` method to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
