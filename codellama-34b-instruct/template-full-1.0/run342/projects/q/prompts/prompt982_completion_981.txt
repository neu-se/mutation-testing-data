  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
nodeArgs.push(1 + deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 +` would cause the `makeNodeResolver()` function to return a different value, which would then be passed to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `makeNodeResolver()` function to return a different value, which would then be passed to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver("foo"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"foo"` argument would cause the `makeNodeResolver()` function to return a different value, which would then be passed to the callback.

DONE.
