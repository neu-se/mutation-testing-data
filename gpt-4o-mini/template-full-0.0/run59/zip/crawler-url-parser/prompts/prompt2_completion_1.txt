Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string has a length greater than 0 instead of checking for illegal characters, potentially allowing strings that contain illegal characters to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/i, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces illegal characters with an empty string instead of checking for their presence, which would not correctly identify strings with illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.includes(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string contains a space character, which is not a valid check for illegal characters, allowing many valid URLs to be incorrectly flagged as valid.

DONE.
