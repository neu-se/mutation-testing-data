  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only consider the next operation if it has a length greater than 0, but the original code considers all operations regardless of their length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only consider the next operation if it has a length greater than or equal to 0, but the original code does not make this check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only consider the next operation if it has a length less than 0, but the original code does not make this check.  

DONE.
