  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `cos` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would have a different imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would have a different real and imaginary part.

DONE.
