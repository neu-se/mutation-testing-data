  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means that it will block the execution of the program until the file is written, whereas `_writeFile` is an asynchronous version that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileAsync` is an asynchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means that it will return a promise that resolves when the file is written, whereas `_writeFile` is a synchronous version that blocks the execution of the program until the file is written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileCallback` is a callback-based version of `_writeFile`, which means that it takes a callback function as an argument and calls it when the file is written, whereas `_writeFile` is a promise-based version that returns
