  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1, while this replacement checks if the string has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.charAt(string.length - 2) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the string ends with a slash, while this replacement also checks if the character before the slash is also a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.indexOf('/') === string.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the string ends with a slash, while this replacement also checks if the slash is located at the second-to-last position
