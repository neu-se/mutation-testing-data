 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `filter` with a function that negates the truthiness of `null`, instead of evaluating the `test` function passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `filter` with a function that negates the truthiness of `1`, instead of evaluating the `test` function passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'tester'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `filter` with a function that negates the truthiness of the string `'tester'`, instead of evaluating the `test` function passed as an argument.

By introducing these changes, the test suite should fail, indicating that the tests are not accounting for these edge cases. Developers can then update their tests to ensure that the `filterNot` function behaves
