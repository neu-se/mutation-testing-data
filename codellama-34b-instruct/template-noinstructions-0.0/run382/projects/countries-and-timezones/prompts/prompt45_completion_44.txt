  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of a country object, as the `id` parameter is not a valid country ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return the first country in the `data.countries` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return the second country in the `data.countries` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
