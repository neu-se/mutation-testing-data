  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not a valid argument for the `callback` function, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function, while `[]` is an empty array and would not contain the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Object()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is an object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function, while `new Object()` creates a new empty object and would not contain the correct arguments.

DONE.
