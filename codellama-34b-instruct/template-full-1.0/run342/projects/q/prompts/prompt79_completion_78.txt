  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the nextTick function would be called with a delay of 1 millisecond instead of 0 milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the nextTick function would be called with a negative delay of 1 millisecond instead of 0 milliseconds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the nextTick function would be called with a random delay between 0 and 1 millisecond instead of 0 milliseconds.

DONE.
