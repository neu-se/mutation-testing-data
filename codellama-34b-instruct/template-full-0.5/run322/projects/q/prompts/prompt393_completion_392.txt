  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a new rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` creates a new resolved promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

DONE.
