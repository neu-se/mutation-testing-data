  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to be set to `true`, which would enable the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to be set to `false`, which would disable the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections && <some condition>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to be set to `true` only if the `<some condition>` is also true.

DONE.
