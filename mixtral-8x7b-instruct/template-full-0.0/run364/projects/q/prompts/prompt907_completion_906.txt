 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.bind(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `Function.prototype.apply` to bind `Array.prototype.slice` instead of directly referencing `array_slice`. This could cause issues if the context (`this`) passed to `apply` is not an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `slice` method on a new, empty array instance. While this method is not supposed to rely on the context (`this`), it might lead to unexpected results due to potential changes in future JavaScript versions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor.bind(null, Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `Function.prototype.bind` to bind `Array.prototype.slice` to `Math
