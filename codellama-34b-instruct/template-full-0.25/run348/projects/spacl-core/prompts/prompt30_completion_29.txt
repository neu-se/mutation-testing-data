  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional string 'foo' would be appended to the accumulator, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would remove the first character of the accumulator, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the split, reverse, and join methods would reverse the order of the characters in the accumulator, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
