  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op(data)` calls the `op` function with the `data` argument, whereas the original code simply calls the `once` function with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd()` calls the `onEnd` function with no arguments, whereas the original code calls `onEnd` with the argument `end === true ? null : end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once(data)` calls the `once` function with the `data` argument, whereas the original code calls `once` with no arguments.

DONE.
