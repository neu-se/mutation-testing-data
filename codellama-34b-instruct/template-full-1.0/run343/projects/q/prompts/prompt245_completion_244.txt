  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operation === "when" && operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operation === "when"` check would always be true, resulting in the `operands[1]` function being called, which could result in unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call(resolvedPromise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` function is called with the `args` array, which could result in unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.promiseDispatch.apply(promise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` function is called with `promise` as the `this` context, which could result in unintended consequences.

DONE.
