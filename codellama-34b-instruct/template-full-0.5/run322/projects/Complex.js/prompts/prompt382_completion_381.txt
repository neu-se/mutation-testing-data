  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `b` is not equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `b` is not equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `b` is not equal to `0`.

DONE.
