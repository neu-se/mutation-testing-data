  Here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER, each with a brief explanation of the different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, even if the read argument is not a function or is null/undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof read === 'function' && 'source' in read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true if the read argument is a function and has a property called "source".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read instanceof Function && 'source' in read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true if the read argument is an instance of the Function class and has a property called "source".

DONE.
