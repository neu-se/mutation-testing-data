  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is a function, and `test()` would invoke the function, which would return a different result than `tester()`, which is a reference to a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.someOtherMethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.someOtherMethod()` would invoke a different method than `tester()`, which could potentially have a different behavior or output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.someProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.someProperty` could be a different value than `tester()`, which could potentially have a different behavior or output.

DONE.
