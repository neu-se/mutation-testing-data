  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the `args` object, rather than resolved with the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the `args` object, rather than rejected with the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the `args` object, rather than rejected with the `promise` object.

DONE.
