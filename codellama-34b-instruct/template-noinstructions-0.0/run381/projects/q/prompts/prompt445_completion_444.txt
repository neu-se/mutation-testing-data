  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` argument is missing, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not be called, leading to unhandled rejections not being tracked correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` argument is missing, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to not be called, leading to unhandled rejections not being tracked correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` and `promise` arguments are swapped, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unhandled rejections not being tracked correctly.

DONE.
