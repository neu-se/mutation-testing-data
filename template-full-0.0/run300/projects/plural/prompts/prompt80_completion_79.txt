  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose". Replacing it with `'goose'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose". Replacing it with `'gooses'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gosling'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose". Replacing it with `'gosling'` would result in a completely different word with a different meaning.

DONE.
