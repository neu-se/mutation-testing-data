  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first element of the `attempt3` array, instead of checking all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attempt3` array has any elements, instead of checking if the first element is a match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.indexOf(stackLine) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stackLine` is present in the `attempt3` array, instead of checking if the first element is a match.

DONE.
