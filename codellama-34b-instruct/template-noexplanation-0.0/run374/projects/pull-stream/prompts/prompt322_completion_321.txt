  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called only if `a` is true and `onEnd` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || onEnd
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called only if `a` is false or `onEnd` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== onEnd
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called only if `a` is not equal to `onEnd`.

DONE.
