  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while the mutated code checks for inequality. This would cause the `if` block to be executed even if the compression level is set to `uncompressed`, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression > COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while the mutated code checks for greater than. This would cause the `if` block to be executed even if the compression level is set to a value greater than `uncompressed`, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression < COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncom
