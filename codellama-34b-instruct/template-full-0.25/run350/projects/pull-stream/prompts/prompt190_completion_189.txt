  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `map === null` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `map` is not a function. In the original code, `!map` would evaluate to `true` if `map` is not a function, which would cause the function to return `id` immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `map !== null` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `map` is not a function. In the original code, `!map` would evaluate to `false` if `map` is not a function, which would cause the function to return `id` immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof map !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof map !== 'function'` would evaluate to `true` if `map` is not a function, which would cause the function to return `id` immediately
