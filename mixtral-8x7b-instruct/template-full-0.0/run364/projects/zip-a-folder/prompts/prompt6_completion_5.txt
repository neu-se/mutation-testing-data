 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the current working directory, instead of the directory of the targetFilePath.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => path.dirname(targetFilePath)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a function that returns the directory name, instead of directly returning the directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename(targetFilePath, path.extname(targetFilePath))
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the base name of the targetFilePath (without extension), instead of the directory name.

DONE.
