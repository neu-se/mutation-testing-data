  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a primitive value that is not the same as the original value passed to the `then` method, which could be anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be rejected with an error, whereas before it would have been resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be rejected with the original value, whereas before it would have been resolved with the original value.

DONE.
