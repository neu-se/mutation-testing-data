  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the logical NOT operator (!), which would return `true` if `cb` was not a function, while the new code fragment uses the inverse comparison operator (===), which would return `true` if `cb` was not a function or if it was null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the logical NOT operator (!), which would return `true` if `cb` was not a function, while the new code fragment uses the `typeof` operator to check if `cb` is a function or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && (typeof cb !== 'function' || cb.constructor !== Function)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the logical NOT operator (!), which would return `true` if `cb` was not a function, while the
