 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would not be called, and the value at the specified key would be set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the value, effectively removing any functionality provided by the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because a number would be passed as the value, which would likely cause an error when attempting to use the `updater` function.

DONE.
