  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is expected to return a boolean value, but `test(data)` would return the result of the `test` function, which could be any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is expected to take a single argument, but `test(data, data)` would pass two arguments, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
