  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
` spoleƒç[:latitude, :longitude]}`
This would result in different behavior because the method `fromGeoJSON` would return a falsy value in the case of invalid arguments, which could cause the `toTile` method to fail with a buggy output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`sin(90 - point.longitude)`
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the destination point would be biased towards the longitudes close to 90 degrees, which could cause the `toTile` method to fail with a buggy output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`Math.sqrt(-1)`
This would result in different behavior because the square root of -1 is not defined in real numbers, which could cause the `toTile` method to fail with a buggy output.

DONE.
