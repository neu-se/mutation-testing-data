Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var inspected = inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function again, potentially leading to a different state being returned, which could affect the promise's behavior if the state changes between calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var inspected = { state: "fulfilled", value: "default" };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hardcode the state to "fulfilled" and set a default value, causing the promise to incorrectly report that it has been fulfilled regardless of its actual state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var inspected = { state: "rejected", reason: "error" };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to always report as rejected with a specific error message, even if the promise was actually fulfilled or pending, misleading the consumer of the promise.

DONE.
