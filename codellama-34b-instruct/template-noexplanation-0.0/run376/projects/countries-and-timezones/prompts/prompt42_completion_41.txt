  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options) + 1 }
```
This change will cause the `getAllCountries` function to return a map with the same keys as the original map, but with the values incremented by 1. This change will not affect the behavior of the other functions, but it will make the test suite more effective by testing the edge case where the values are not equal to the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options) - 1 }
```
This change will cause the `getAllCountries` function to return a map with the same keys as the original map, but with the values decremented by 1. This change will not affect the behavior of the other functions, but it will make the test suite more effective by testing the edge case where the values are not equal to the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options
