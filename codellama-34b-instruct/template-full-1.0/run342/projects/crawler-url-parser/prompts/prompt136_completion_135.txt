  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index.[a-z]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex matches any character zero or more times at the end of the string, rather than just matching lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex matches any character zero or more times at the end of the string, rather than just matching lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex uses the global flag to perform a global match, rather than just matching the first occurrence.

DONE.
