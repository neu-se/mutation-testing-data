  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not called, which could cause the promise to never resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, rather than being resolved with the value passed to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.dfd
```
This would result in different behavior because the object passed to the callback would be a deferred object, rather than the expected value.

DONE.
