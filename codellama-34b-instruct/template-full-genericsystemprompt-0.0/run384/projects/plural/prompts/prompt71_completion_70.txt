  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which is a valid word, but `'cellos'` is not a valid word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which is a valid word, but `'cellos'` is not a valid word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which is a valid word, but `'cellos'` is not a valid word.

DONE.
