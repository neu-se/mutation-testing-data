  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an array (promises) is no longer being returned, but rather an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value is now being returned instead of an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an undefined value is now being returned instead of an array of promises.

DONE.
