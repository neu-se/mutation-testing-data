  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in row
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the key is not in the row, while this code fragment checks if the key is in the row. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the key is not in the row, but the original code fragment would not have failed in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in row && row.key !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the key is not in the row, while this code fragment checks if the key is in the row and the row.key is not undefined. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the key is in the row but the row.key is undefined, but the original code fragment would not have failed in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in row && row.key !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
