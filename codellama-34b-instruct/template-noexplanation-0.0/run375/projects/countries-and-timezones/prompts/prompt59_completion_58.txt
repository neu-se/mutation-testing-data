  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id - 1)
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id * 2)
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected input.

DONE.
