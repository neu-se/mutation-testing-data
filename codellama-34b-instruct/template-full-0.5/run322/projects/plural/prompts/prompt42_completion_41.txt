  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different substring of the input word, potentially changing the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different substring of the input word, potentially changing the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different substring of the input word, potentially changing the plural form.

DONE.
