  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([x, y])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to an array of the two values, rather than a promise that resolves to the first value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race([x, y])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to the first value, rather than a promise that resolves to an array of the two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.join(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to an array of the two values, rather than a promise that resolves to the first value.

DONE.
