Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` expects the first argument to be an array of arguments, while `nfapply` is designed to handle Node-style callbacks, which includes appending a resolver function to the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfcall(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is intended to call the function with the provided arguments directly, rather than treating them as an array and appending a resolver, which would change how the callback is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` does not append a resolver function to the arguments, which is necessary for Node-style callbacks, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
