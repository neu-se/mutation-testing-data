  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test would fail if the function is expecting the error message to be specific to the `options.url` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test would pass if the function is expecting the error message to be specific to the `options.dest` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test would fail if the function is expecting the error message to be specific to the `options.dest` parameter.

DONE.
