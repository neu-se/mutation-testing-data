  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 || b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if either a or b is 0, while the original code fragment only returns true if both a and b are 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never return true if either a or b is 0, while the original code fragment returns true if both a and b are 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * b) == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if either a or b is 0, but not if both are 0.

DONE.
