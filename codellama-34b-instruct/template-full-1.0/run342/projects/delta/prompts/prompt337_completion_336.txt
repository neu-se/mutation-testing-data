  Sure, here are three different options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the given code fragment with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(baseIndex / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is dividing the base index by 2, which is not the same as taking the ceiling of the base index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(baseIndex / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is taking the floor of the base index divided by 2, which is not the same as taking the ceiling of the base index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(baseIndex / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is rounding the base index divided by 2 to the nearest integer, which is not the same as taking the ceiling of the base index.
