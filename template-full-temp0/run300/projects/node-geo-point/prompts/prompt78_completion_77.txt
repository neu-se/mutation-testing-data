  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of the latitude, which is not the same as the longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of the latitude, which is not the same as the longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude, which is not the same as the latitude.

DONE.
