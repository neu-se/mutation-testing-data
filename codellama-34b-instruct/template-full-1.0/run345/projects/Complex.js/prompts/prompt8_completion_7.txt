  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applying the `Math.abs` function to `1 + x`, which would be a different value than the original `x`, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be applying the `Math.abs` function to `x * x`, which would be a different value than the original `x`, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function would be applying the `Math.abs` function to `2 * x`, which would be a different value than the original `x`, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
