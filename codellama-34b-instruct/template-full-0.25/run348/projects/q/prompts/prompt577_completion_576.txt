  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different verb than "next" and would cause the generator to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is a different verb than "next" and would cause the generator to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because "yield" is a different verb than "next" and would cause the generator to behave differently.

DONE.
