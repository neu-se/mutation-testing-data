 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisp
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` refers to the value of `this` in the enclosing function, which may not be the expected `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the last argument to the callback, even if there are no additional arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass an empty array as the last argument to the callback, even if there are no additional arguments.

DONE.
