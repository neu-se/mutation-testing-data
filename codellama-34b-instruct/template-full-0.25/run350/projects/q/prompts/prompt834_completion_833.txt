  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` argument is not a function, which would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` argument is now a function, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, function() {}, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` argument is now a function, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

DONE.
