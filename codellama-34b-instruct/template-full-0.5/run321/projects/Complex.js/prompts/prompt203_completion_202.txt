  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that returns the value of `e` (approximately 2.718) raised to the power of its argument, whereas `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of its first argument raised to the power of its second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a function that returns the square root of its argument, whereas `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of its first argument raised to the power of its second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` is a function that returns the natural logarithm (base `e`) of its argument, whereas `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of its first argument raised to the power of its second
