  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).catch(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the reason if the callback fails, while this new code fragment throws the reason regardless of whether the callback succeeds or fails.
