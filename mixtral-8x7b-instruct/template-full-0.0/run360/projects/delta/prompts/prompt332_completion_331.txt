 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of modifying the existing one, which might cause unexpected results in the rest of the code that relies on the original object being mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the original attributes and sets them to an empty object, which might cause unexpected results in the rest of the code that relies on those attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the base attributes instead of the current attributes, which might cause unexpected results in the rest of the code that relies on the correct attributes being used.

DONE.
