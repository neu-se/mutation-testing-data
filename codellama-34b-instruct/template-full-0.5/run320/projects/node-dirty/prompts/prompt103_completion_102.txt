  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` would be undefined, and `this._data.delete()` would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.delete()` would be called with a different key, which may not exist in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.delete()` would be called with a different key, which may not exist in the database.

DONE.
