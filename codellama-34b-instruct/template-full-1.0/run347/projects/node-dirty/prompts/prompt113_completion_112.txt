  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* isnull(this._data.size)
```
This would result in different behavior if the value of this._data.size is null, undefined, or a not a number. The * operator would treat the value as a function and attempt to call it, which would return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.data.size
```
This would result in different behavior if the value of this._data.size is not falsy. The ! operator would return the complement of the truthy or false value of this._data.size, which would not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.data.size=null
```
This would result in different behavior than the original code fragment. It would set the value of this._data.size to null before emitting "load" event.

DONE.
