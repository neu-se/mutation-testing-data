  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromCallback` method returns a callback-based function, while the `fromPromise` method returns a promise-based function. This could cause issues if the code is not expecting a callback-based function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromPromise` method returns a promise-based function, while the `fromCallback` method returns a callback-based function. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a promise-based function.
