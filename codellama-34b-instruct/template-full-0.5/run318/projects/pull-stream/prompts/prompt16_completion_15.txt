  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be one less than the actual length of the arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to skip over the last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be one more than the actual length of the arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to throw an error when trying to access an argument that does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object does not have a `length` property, so the function would throw an error when trying to access the `length` property.

DONE.
