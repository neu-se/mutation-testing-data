 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the logarithm function, which can lead to incorrect values or even errors when the input is 1 or greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return -Infinity for any input, while the original code fragment returns the correct logarithm value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log(2) * Math.log(a) / Math.log(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the logarithm of the input in base 2, which is not equivalent to the original code fragment that calculates the natural logarithm.

DONE.
