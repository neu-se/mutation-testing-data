  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parser_exit` throws an error and terminates the program, while the new code fragment `return 0` simply returns the value 0 and continues program execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return a + b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parser_exit` throws an error and terminates the program, while the new code fragment `return a + b` returns the sum of `a` and `b` and continues program execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return a * b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parser_exit` throws an error and terminates the program, while the new code fragment `return a * b` returns the product of `a` and `b` and continues program execution.

DONE.
