  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the done callback would not be executed if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not an object, and calling a function on it would result in a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new empty function is created, which would not have the same behavior as the original done callback.

DONE.
