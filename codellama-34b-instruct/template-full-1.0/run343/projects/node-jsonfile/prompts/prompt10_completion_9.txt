  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function would be called with the `null` value instead of the `options.reviver` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver, function(k, v) { return k; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function would be called for every element in the array, and would return the value of the key instead of the value.

DONE.
