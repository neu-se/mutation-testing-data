  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + "hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is a string, and by adding the string "hello world", the resulting string would be different from the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `data` string to upper-case, resulting in a different output from the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split(",")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `data` string on commas, resulting in an array of strings, rather than a single string.

DONE.
