  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a distinct value from `promise`, and the code would fail to function as intended if `promise` is relied upon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a distinct value from `promise`, and the code would fail to function as intended if `promise` is relied upon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a distinct value from `promise`, and the code would fail to function as intended if `promise` is relied upon.

DONE.
