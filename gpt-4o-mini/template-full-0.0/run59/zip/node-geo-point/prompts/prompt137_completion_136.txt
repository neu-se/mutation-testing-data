Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the longitude instead of adjusting it based on the specified precision, leading to incorrect geographical positioning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the latitude by 2 instead of returning the original latitude, which would distort the geographical representation of the point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly applies the precision adjustment to the latitude instead of the longitude, which is not the intended functionality of the method.

DONE.
