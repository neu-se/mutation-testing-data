  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is called with a timeout of 1000 milliseconds, which would cause the promise to be delayed by 1 second before resolving.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is called with a timeout of 0 milliseconds, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is called with a timeout of Infinity, which would cause the promise to never resolve.

DONE.
