  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be entered, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `!threw` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be entered, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw && !threw
```
This would result in different behavior because `threw && !threw` is always falsey, so the `if` statement would never be entered, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

DONE.
