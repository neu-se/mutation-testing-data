  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is not valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is not recognized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```

DONE.
