  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "mouse," which is "mice." Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with "mouses" would result in the function returning the plural form of "mouses," which is "mouses."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "mouse," which is "mice." Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with "mice" + "s" would result in the function returning the plural form of "mice" + "s," which is "mices."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "mouse," which is "mice."
