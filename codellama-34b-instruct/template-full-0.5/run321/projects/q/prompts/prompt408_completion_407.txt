  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method. This would cause the `nearer` function to return a different value for non-promise objects, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `nearer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is a function that checks if a promise is fulfilled. If the `nearer` function is replaced with `isFulfilled`, it would return a different value for fulfilled promises, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `nearer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a function that checks if a promise is rejected
