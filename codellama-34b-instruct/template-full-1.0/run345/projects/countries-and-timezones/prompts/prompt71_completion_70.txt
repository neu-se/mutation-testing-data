  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` converts the `name` string to uppercase, which may not exist in the `data` object, leading to a different timezone object being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.split(' ').join('_'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `split(' ').join('_')` replaces spaces in the `name` string with underscores, which may not be present in the `data` object, leading to a different timezone object being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first character of the `name` string, which may not be present in the `data` object, leading to a different timezone object being returned.

DONE.
