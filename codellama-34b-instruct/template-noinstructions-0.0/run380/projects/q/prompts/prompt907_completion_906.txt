  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null)` is a bound function that always returns an empty array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(undefined)` is a bound function that always returns an empty array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(this)` is a bound function that always returns an empty array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a slice of an array.

DONE.
