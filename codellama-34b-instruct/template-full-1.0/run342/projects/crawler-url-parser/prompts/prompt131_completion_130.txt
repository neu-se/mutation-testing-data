  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/[default|index]\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to also match the word "default" in addition to "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string has been changed from '/' to ''.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to match any sequence of one or more letters followed by a period and one or more letters, rather than specifically matching the words "index" or "default".

DONE.
