  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "foo" to the name variable, which would cause the npost method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the name variable, which would cause the npost method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the name variable to uppercase, which would cause the npost method to fail.

DONE.
