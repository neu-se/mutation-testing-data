  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `1` would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return a different country than the original code fragment, which would cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `null` would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return `null` instead of a country object, which would cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `{ deprecated: true }` would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return a deprecated country object instead of a current country object, which would cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
