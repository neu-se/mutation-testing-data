Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|[^aeiou]$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly matches any word that ends with a consonant (not just 's'), which would lead to incorrect pluralization for words like "cat" or "dog".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the case-insensitive flag (`i`) for the 's' match, causing it to fail for words like "Cats" or "Dogs" that end with an uppercase 'S'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|z$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the last condition to match words ending with 'z' instead of 's', which would incorrectly pluralize words like "buzz" to "buzzes" instead of "buzzs".

DONE.
