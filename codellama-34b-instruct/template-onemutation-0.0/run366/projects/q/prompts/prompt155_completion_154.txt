  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `filterStackString` function to lowercase, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong name, leading to a `TypeError` exception.

DONE.
