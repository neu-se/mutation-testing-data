Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being parsed from the destination's parent directory to the destination itself, potentially affecting the root path comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being parsed from the destination's parent directory to the source directory, which could lead to incorrect root path comparisons and affect the function's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(destParent, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to parse the parent directory of the destination's parent directory, which could lead to incorrect root path comparisons and affect the function's logic, especially if the destination's parent directory is already the root directory.

DONE.
