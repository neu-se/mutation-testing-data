Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the reduction to remove null values when `keepNull` is explicitly set to `true`, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, causing the block to execute regardless of the value of `keepNull`, thus ignoring the intended conditional logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the block when `keepNull` is any value other than `false`, including `undefined` or `null`, which could lead to unintended behavior in cases where `keepNull` is not explicitly set.

DONE.
