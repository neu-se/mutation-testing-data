  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not the same as the `close` method, and it would cause the `drain` event to be emitted immediately, rather than when the write stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not the same as the `close` method, and it would cause the `close` event to be emitted immediately, rather than when the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close` method to be called immediately, rather than when the write stream is closed.

DONE.
