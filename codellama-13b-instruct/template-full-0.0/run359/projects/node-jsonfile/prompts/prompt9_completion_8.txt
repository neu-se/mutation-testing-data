  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable, which is a buffer, and the resulting string is then passed to `JSON.parse()`. This would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the buffer contains invalid JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable with the `'utf8'` encoding, and the resulting string is then passed to `JSON.parse()`. This would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the buffer contains invalid JSON data that is not encoded in UTF-8.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString('ascii')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable with the `'ascii'` encoding, and the resulting string
