 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the `defer` object's `resolve` method with the rejected argument, it creates a new rejected promise, which might not be handled by the same error handling mechanism as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `exception` argument to `null`, which might cause the error handling code to not execute correctly or at all, depending on how it's implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the `defer` object with the `exception` argument instead of rejecting it, which might cause the error handling code to not execute correctly or at all, depending on how it's implemented.

DONE.
