  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the default file extension from the URL, while the new code fragment would remove the default file extension and the preceding slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the default file extension from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace the default file extension with the string "default".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default\.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the default file extension from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace the default file extension with the string "default" followed by the file extension.

DONE.
