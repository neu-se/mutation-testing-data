 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message no longer includes the `buffer` content, which might make it harder to diagnose issues related to the contents of the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'error', () => new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a function expression that returns an Error object, which might cause issues if the error handling code expects an Error object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'warn', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event type from 'error' to 'warn', which might cause the error handling code to not execute or execute differently, depending on how the application handles 'warn' events.

DONE.
