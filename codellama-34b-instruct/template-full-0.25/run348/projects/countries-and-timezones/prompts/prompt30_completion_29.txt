  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function is called with a different argument, `min`, instead of `hours`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(hours + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function is called with a different argument, `hours + 1`, instead of `hours`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(hours * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function is called with a different argument, `hours * 2`, instead of `hours`.

DONE.
