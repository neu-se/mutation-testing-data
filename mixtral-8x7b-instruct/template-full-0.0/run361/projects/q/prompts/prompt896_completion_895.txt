 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the Q.defer() method instead of the defer() method local to the prototype. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to use the non-existent Promise.defer() method instead of the defer() method local to the prototype. This would cause an error and break the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.defer()
