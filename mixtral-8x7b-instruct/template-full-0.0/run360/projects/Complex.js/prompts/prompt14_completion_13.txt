 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.sin(x) calculates the sine of x, which is different from the cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.cos(x + 1) calculates the cosine of (x + 1), which is different from the original cos(x) - 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(x)
