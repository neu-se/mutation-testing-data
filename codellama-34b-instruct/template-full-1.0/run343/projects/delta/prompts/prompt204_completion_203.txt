  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `other.ops.slice(1)` to concat the second op of `other` to `delta`, while this suggestion would use the rest of `other` starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `other.ops.slice(1)` to concat the second op of `other` to `delta`, while this suggestion would use the rest of `this` starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return `this.concat(other.slice(1))` if the last element of `other` is an insert, while this suggestion would return `this.concat(null)` which would result in an error.

DONE.
