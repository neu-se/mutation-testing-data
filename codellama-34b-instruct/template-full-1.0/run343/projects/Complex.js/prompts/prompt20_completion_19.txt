  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only executed the `Math.log(a * a + b * b) * 0.5` expression when both `a` and `b` were less than 3000. However, this modified code fragment would execute the expression even if one of `a` or `b` was greater than 3000, which could cause the function to return a result different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 3000 && b !== 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code executed the `Math.log(a * a + b * b) * 0.5` expression when both `a` and `b` were less than 3000. However, this modified code fragment would execute the expression for any values of `a` and `b` that were not equal to 300
