  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)/i.exec
```
This would result in a case-insensitive match, differing from the original match which is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(\d+)\)/i.exec
```
This would result in the inclusion of an unwanted additional capturing group, which might cause the code to fail to properly handle the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)/g.exec
```
This would result in the match being performed globally instead of just once, which might cause the code to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
