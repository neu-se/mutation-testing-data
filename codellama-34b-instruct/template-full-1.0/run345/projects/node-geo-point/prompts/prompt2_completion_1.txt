  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude is being compared to the wrong range of values. The latitude range is -90 to 90, but the buggy code fragment compares it to -90 to 180, which would cause the constructor to throw an error for valid latitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -90 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude is being compared to the wrong range of values. The longitude range is -180 to 180, but the buggy code fragment compares it to -90 to 180, which would cause the constructor to throw an error for valid longitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const badLatitude = true;
if ( badLatitude ) { throw new RangeError('bad latitude value'); }
```
