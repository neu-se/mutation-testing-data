  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the first string contains the second string, while the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if the first string does not include the second string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the second string in the first string, while the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if the first string does not include the second string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method checks if the first string matches the second string as a regular expression, while the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if the first string does not include the second string.

DONE
