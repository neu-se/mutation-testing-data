  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the next operation in the other iterator was an insert, while this replacement would check if the next operation in the other iterator was a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the next operation in the other iterator was an insert, while this replacement would check if the next operation in the current iterator was an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the next operation in the other iterator was an insert, while this replacement would check if the next operation in the other iterator was a delete.

DONE.
