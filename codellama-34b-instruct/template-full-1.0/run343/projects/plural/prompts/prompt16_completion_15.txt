  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length - 2` would remove two characters from the end of the word, instead of one, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that should have only one character removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` would pluralize the word without removing any characters, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that require character removal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `1, w.length` would pluralize the word without removing any characters, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that require character removal.

DONE.
