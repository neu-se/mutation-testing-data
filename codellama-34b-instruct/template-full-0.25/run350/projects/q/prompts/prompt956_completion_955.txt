  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array, omitting the first element. In the original code, the `nodeArgs` array is passed as-is to the `Q` function, but with this change, the first element of the array would be omitted, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of merging the `nodeArgs` array with the argument `1`. In the original code, the `nodeArgs` array is passed as-is to the `Q` function, but with this change, the `Q` function would receive a different array that contains the original elements of `nodeArgs` plus the additional element `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
