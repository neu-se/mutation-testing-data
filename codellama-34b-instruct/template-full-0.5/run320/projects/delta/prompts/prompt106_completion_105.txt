  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.call(this, op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, whereas `predicate` is a function that takes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.apply(this, [op, index])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, whereas `predicate` is a function that takes two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.bind(this, op, index)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a given `this` value and arguments, whereas `predicate` is a function that takes two arguments.

DONE.
