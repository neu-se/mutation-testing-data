  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass one argument to `baseArgs.concat()` instead of two, which would cause the resulting array to have a different length and potentially different elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass three arguments to `baseArgs.concat()` instead of two, which would cause the resulting array to have a different length and potentially different elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass zero arguments to `baseArgs.concat()` instead of two, which would cause the resulting array to have a different length and potentially different elements.

DONE.
