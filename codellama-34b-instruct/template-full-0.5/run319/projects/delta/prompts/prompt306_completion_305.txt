  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the line would be increased by 1, which would cause the line to be longer than it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the line would be doubled, which would cause the line to be longer than it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the line would be halved, which would cause the line to be shorter than it should be.

DONE.
