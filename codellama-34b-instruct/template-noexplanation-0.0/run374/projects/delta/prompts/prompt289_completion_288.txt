  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This will cause the iterator to skip over the next two elements in the array, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This will cause the iterator to return the current element, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This will cause the iterator to return the previous element, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
