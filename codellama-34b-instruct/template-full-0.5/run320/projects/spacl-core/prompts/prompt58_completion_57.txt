  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references the second capturing group instead of the first, which could cause unexpected results if the regex pattern does not have two capturing groups.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references the entire match instead of the first capturing group, which could cause unexpected results if the regex pattern does not have a capturing group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$123'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references a capturing group that does not exist in the regex pattern, which could cause an error.

DONE.
