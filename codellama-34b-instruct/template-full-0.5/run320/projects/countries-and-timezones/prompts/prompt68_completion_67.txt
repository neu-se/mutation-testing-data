  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country == null` would check for null or undefined, while `!country` would only check for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country.id` would check if the country id is falsy, while `!country` would check if the country object is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.id == null` would check if the country id is null or undefined, while `!country` would only check if the country object is falsy.

DONE.
