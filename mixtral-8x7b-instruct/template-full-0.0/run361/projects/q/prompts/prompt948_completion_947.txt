 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would receive a `null` value as the context, which might cause issues if the method expects a specific context to function properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would receive a `true` value as the context, which is not the expected value and might cause issues if the method expects a specific context to function properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeChild()
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeChild` is not the same method as `makeNodeResolver`. The `makeChild` method creates a new deferred object that is a child of the current deferred object, while `makeNodeResolver` creates a Node.js-style continuation-passing-
