  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) && rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which requires both operands to be true. In the original code, the `matches` method is only called once, so the second call would always return true, even if the first call returned false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) || rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which requires only one operand to be true. In the original code, the `matches` method is only called once, so the second call would always return true, even if the first call returned false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) ^ rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator is a
