  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` returns the path of the current module file, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current module's parent directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current module's parent directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(require.main.filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `require.main.filename` returns the path of the main module file, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current module's parent directory.

DONE.
