  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ncall
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` expects a method name and arguments as separate arguments, while `ncall` expects a method and any number of arguments to be passed directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` is a specific method for calling methods on an object, while `dispatch` is a more general method for dispatching any kind of JavaScript function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` is specific to calling methods on an object, while `apply` can be used to call any kind of JavaScript function.

DONE.
