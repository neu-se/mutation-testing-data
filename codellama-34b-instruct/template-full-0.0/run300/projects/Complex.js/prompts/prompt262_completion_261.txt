  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the addition operator, which returns the sum of the two operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the multiplication operator, which returns the product of the two operands.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the division operator, which returns the quotient of the two operands.

DONE.
