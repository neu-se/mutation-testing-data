Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.unshift(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method of adding the property to the `props` array from appending to the beginning of the array instead of the end, which could affect the order of properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the property being pushed to the `props` array by converting it to uppercase, potentially altering the expected values stored in `props`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the length of the `part` string into the `props` array instead of the actual property name, which would lead to incorrect or unexpected values being stored.

DONE.
