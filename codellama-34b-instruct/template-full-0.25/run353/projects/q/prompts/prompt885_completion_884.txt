  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements except the first one, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove and return the last element of the array, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` would remove and return the first element of the array, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the function.

DONE.
