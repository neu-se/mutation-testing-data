  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `true`, while the new code fragment `false` always returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `i > max` checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while the new code fragment `max` checks if `max` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `i > max` checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while the new code fragment `i <= max` checks if `i` is less than or equal to `max`.

DONE.
