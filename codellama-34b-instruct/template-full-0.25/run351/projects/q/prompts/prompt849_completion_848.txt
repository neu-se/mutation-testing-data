  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called with the `error` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error. In the original code, the `deferred.reject` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a default error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would be called with the `error` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the error. In the original code, the `deferred.reject` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a default error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred
