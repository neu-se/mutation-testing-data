  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(array)` would always return `true`, even if `array` is not an array, whereas `!Array.isArray(array)` would return `false` if `array` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length === 0` would return `true` if `array` is an empty array, whereas `!Array.isArray(array)` would return `false` if `array` is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length > 0` would return `true` if `array` is a non-empty array, whereas `!Array.isArray(array)` would return `false` if `array` is a non-empty
