  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the code to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, and the code that follows the loop would never be reached.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not iterate the last time, potentially causing the code to miss an important part of the input.

DONE.
