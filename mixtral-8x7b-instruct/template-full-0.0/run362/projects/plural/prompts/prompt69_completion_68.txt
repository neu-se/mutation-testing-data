 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'xeno', 'xenos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule was for a specific string, while this new rule uses a regular expression that can match other words not intended by the original rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/meno$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule changed the 'e' to 'e's', while this new rule simply appends an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memo', function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule was a specific string-string pair, while this new rule is a string-function pair, which would cause any word that matches the first argument of the function to have 's' appended to it.
