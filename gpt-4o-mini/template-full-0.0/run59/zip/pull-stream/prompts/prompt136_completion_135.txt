Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the error object, it passes `null`, which may lead to the callback being invoked without an error, potentially causing the application to behave incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('An unexpected error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object with a different message, which may not accurately represent the original error, leading to confusion in error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the error object may cause the callback to be invoked without any error information, which could lead to unhandled situations in the application.

DONE.
