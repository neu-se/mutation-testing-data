  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of the `test` function, which could potentially cause the `filter` function to return a different set of data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `data` variable as an argument to the `test` function twice, which could cause the function to behave differently depending on how it handles duplicate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data+data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the result of concatenating the `data` variable with itself to the `test` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently depending on how it handles string arguments.

DONE.
