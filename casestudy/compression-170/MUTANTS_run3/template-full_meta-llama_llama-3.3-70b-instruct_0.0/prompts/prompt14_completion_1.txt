Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a different status code in the response, potentially causing issues with the client's interpretation of the response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
req.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the request's status code instead of the response's status code, which could lead to incorrect status codes being sent in the response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
200
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always send a status code of 200 (OK), regardless of the actual status code of the response, potentially masking errors or other issues.

DONE.
