Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Object.keys(timezones).map((key) => timezones[key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns all timezones without filtering out deprecated ones, unlike the original `deliverTimezones` function which selectively returns only non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Object.values(timezones);
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of timezone objects instead of an object, which changes the structure of the output and may lead to issues in code that expects an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Object.keys(timezones).reduce((prev, key) => { prev[key] = timezones[key]; return prev; }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not check for the `deprecated` property, thus returning all timezones regardless of their deprecation status, which is contrary to the intended functionality of the original `deliverTimezones` function.

DONE.
