  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substring
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.slice
```
This change will also cause the `next` method to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr
```
This change will cause the `next` method to return the same value as the original code, which may not cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
