  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodedBasename` variable as-is, while this change uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the value to uppercase. This could potentially cause issues if the code that uses the `options.dest` variable is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.basename()` method to extract the basename from the `options.url` variable, while this change uses the `path.basename()` method to extract the basename from the `options.dest` variable. This could potentially cause issues if the code that uses the `options.dest` variable expects a different basename than what is actually provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(options.url)
```
This would
