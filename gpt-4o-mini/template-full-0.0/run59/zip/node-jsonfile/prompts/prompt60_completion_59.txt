Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is a string instead of verifying if it is a Buffer, which would lead to the content being converted to a UTF-8 string even when it is a Buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an instance of an Array, which would incorrectly allow non-Buffer objects to bypass the UTF-8 conversion, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is null, which would prevent any conversion from occurring even if `content` is a Buffer, leading to unexpected results when processing valid Buffer data.

DONE.
