 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value is now `null`, whereas the original code resolves with an object containing the `filename` property. This change could expose issues in the test suite related to checking the resolved value's structure and properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolve({ filename: 'incorrect_dest' })
