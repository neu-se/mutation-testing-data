  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject(exception);`, which rejects the promise with the `exception` object, while the new code fragment rejects the promise with the `error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.resolve(value);`, which resolves the promise with the `value` object, while the new code fragment resolves the promise with the `error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.notify(value);`, which notifies the promise with the `value` object, while the new code fragment notifies the promise with the `error` object.

DONE.
