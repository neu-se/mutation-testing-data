  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, it would be more confusing for the user.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a valid path')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, it would be more specific and helpful for the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is the same, but the code fragment is different, it would be more confusing for the user.

DONE.
