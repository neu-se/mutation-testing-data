  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(1)` would return a new string that is a slice of the original string, starting from the second character. In contrast, `content` would return the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toUpperCase()` would return a new string that is the original string converted to uppercase, while `content` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.split('')` would return an array of strings, each of which is a single character from the original string, while `content` would return the original string.

DONE.
