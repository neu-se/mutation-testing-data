  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is not a valid property of the `otherOp` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is a different object than `thisOp.attributes`, and would cause the `AttributeMap.diff` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different value than `thisOp.insert`, and would cause the `isEqual` method to return `false`.

DONE.
