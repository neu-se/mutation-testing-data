  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which will result in a different destination point being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use a latitude value that is one degree higher than the original value, which will result in a different destination point being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use a latitude value that is twice the original value, which will result in a different destination point being calculated.

DONE.
