  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > -1
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the chunk does not contain a newline character, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the chunk contains a newline character at the beginning, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === chunk.length - 1
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the chunk contains a newline character at the end, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
