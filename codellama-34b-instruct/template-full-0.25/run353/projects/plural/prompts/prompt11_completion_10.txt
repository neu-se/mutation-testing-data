  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'ies' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'ies' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 'es'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'y' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'ies' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 'y'.

DONE.
