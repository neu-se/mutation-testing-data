  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log1p(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.log1p(x) calculates log(1+x) for x a number, and would provide a different output for the same input

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.parseInt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because Number.parseInt(x) returns the integer value of x, which can be different from log(x) if x is a non-integer number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x = x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of log(x) to be skipped entirely, resulting in the function returning a completely different output.

DONE.
