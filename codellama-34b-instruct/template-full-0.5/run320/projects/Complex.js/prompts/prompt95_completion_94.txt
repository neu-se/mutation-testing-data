  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `c` is equal to `0`, but this replacement code fragment is checking if `c + 1` is equal to `0`, which is a different condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `c` is equal to `0`, but this replacement code fragment is checking if `c - 1` is equal to `0`, which is a different condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `c` is equal to `0`, but this replacement code fragment is checking if `c * 2` is equal to `0`, which is a different condition.

DONE.
