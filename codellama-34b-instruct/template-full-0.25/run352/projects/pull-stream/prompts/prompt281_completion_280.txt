  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `mapper`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `mapper` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `mapper`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `mapper` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on `mapper` with a `null` context, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `mapper` is not a function.

DONE.
