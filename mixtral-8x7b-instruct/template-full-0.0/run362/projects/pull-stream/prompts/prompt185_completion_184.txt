 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would stop iterating over the array when it reaches a falsy value instead of when it reaches the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would stop iterating over the array one element too late, causing it to return `null` instead of the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the next element in the array instead of the current element.

DONE.
