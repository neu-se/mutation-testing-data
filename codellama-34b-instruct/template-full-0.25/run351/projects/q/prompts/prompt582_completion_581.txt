  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `null` instead of `continuer`, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `undefined` instead of `continuer`, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(function () {}, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on a new function instead of `continuer`, which would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

DONE.
