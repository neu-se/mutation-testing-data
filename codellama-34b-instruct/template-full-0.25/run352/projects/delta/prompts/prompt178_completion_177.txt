  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is one less than the actual length of the next operation in the `other` delta. This could cause the `while` loop to terminate prematurely, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the next operation in the `other` delta. This could cause the `while` loop to iterate one extra time, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is
