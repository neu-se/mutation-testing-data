  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
':'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `:` operator has higher precedence than the `/` operator, so the expression `'/' : '...'` would be parsed as `'/' : ('...')`, which would result in a `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'` character is not a valid delimiter for a regular expression, so the expression `/\'/` would be parsed as a division operator followed by a regular expression, which would result in a `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` character sequence escapes the `'` character, so the expression `'/:\\'` would be parsed as a regular expression that matches a forward slash (`/`) followed by a backslash (`\`) followed by a single quote (`'`), which would result in a false positive.

DONE.
