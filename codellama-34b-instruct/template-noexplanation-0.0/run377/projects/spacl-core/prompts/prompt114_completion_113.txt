  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0];
```
This change will cause the `for` loop to only iterate over the first element of the `verbs` array, rather than all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[verbs.length - 1];
```
This change will cause the `for` loop to only iterate over the last element of the `verbs` array, rather than all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[Math.floor(Math.random() * verbs.length)];
```
This change will cause the `for` loop to iterate over a random element of the `verbs` array, rather than all elements.

DONE.
