  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object, which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback(error, null)` would call the nodeback function with the error object as the first argument and null as the second argument, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object, which is the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw error` would throw the error object, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
