  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in the array, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified element is present in the array, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_find
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_find` returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the index of the element.

DONE.
