  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes three arguments, but the original code fragment only passes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes three arguments to `abortCb`, but this new code fragment only passes two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `abort` as the second argument to `abortCb`, but this new code fragment passes `onAbort` instead.

DONE.
