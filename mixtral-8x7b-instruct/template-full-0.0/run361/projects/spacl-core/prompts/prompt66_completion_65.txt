 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let rule: Rule
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares a new variable `rule` instead of using the existing one, causing a reference error in the `rule.query` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rules
