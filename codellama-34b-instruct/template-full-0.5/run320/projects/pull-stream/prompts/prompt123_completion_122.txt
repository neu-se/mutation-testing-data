  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function, but instead is being incremented by 1 before being passed. This could cause the function to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function, but instead is being decremented by 1 before being passed. This could cause the function to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function, but instead is being multiplied by 2 before being passed. This could cause the function to behave differently in certain edge cases.

DONE.
