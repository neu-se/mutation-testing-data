Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\d+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow paths that contain digits following a slash, which is not the intended behavior of disallowing empty segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any non-empty segment instead of specifically looking for empty segments, potentially allowing invalid paths that do not conform to the original specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\s*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow paths that contain segments with only whitespace, which should be considered as empty segments and thus invalid according to the original logic.

DONE.
