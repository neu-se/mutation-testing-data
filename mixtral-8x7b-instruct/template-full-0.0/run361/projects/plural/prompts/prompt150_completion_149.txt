 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.length ? rules.pop()[1] : word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the last rule's result function instead of the first matching rule's result function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word.substr(0, word.length - 1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always applies the first rule's result function, which is specific to words ending in 'y' or 'quy'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word.replace(/s$/, 'ses')
```
This would result in different behavior because it blindly adds 'es' to the end of the word if it already ends with 's', without considering other applicable rules.

DONE.
