  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the function to return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning the non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, { allTimezones: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allTimezones` option would be set to `false`, which would cause the function to only return the timezones that are associated with the given country, instead of returning all timezones that are associated with the given country and its descendants.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, { countryId: 'Invalid' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` option would be set to an invalid
