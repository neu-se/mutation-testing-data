  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, while `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function. Substituting `cosh` for `sinh` in the expression would result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(-1) * tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-1` would flip the sign of the result computed by `tanh`. While the result would still be a complex number, it would have a different value than the one computed by the original formula.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is the trigonometric sine function, while `tanh` is a hyperbolic function. Substituting `sin` for `tanh` in the expression would result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
