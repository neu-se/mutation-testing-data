  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.remove()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `remove()` method is undefined for strings in JavaScript, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.trim() + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from the ends of a string, but the additional `+ ''` converts the result back to a string, which would cause the final output to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Enum.get(currentUrlStr, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Enum` class is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it would throw an error. Even if there was a valid `Enum` class, the second argument `''` is not a valid key for the enum value, so it would also throw an error.

DONE.
