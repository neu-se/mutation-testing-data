Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly set `allow` to `true` only when the result is `null`, which is not the intended logic of allowing actions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `allow` to `true` for any result that is not `true`, including `false` and `null`, which contradicts the original intent of only allowing actions when explicitly permitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `allow` to `true` when the result is `undefined`, which is not a valid state for determining if an action is allowed, potentially leading to incorrect permissions being granted.

DONE.
