Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern, { strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strict` option is set to `true`, which may cause the `isGlob` function to return different results for certain patterns, potentially changing the outcome of the `isDynamicPattern` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called with only one argument, potentially changing its behavior or causing it to throw an error, depending on its implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!' + pattern, { strict: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called with a modified version of the `pattern` string, which may cause it to return different results, and the `strict` option is still set to `false`, which could interact with the modified pattern in unexpected ways.

DONE.
