  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a substring starting from the second character of `part`, rather than the first character, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring starting from the second character of `part`, rather than the first character, which is what the original code fragment does.

part.substring(1)

DONE.
