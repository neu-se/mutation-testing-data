  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This would cause the promise to be rejected with the exception object itself, rather than the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message, rather than the exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error(exception.message))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, rather than the exception object.

DONE.
