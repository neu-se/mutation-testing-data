 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument of atan2 would be negative b instead of positive b, which would change the sign of the angle and potentially produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
