  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the `log` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a - 1` is an expression that subtracts 1 from the value of `a`. This change would cause the `log` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a * 2` is an expression that multiplies `a` by 2. This change would
