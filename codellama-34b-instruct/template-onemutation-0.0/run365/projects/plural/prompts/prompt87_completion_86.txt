  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'people'`, which is a plural noun. The pluralization function would return a different result for the two code fragments.

DONE.
