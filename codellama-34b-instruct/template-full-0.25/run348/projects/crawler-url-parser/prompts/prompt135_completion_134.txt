  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the replace method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different, which could cause the replace method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the replace method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
