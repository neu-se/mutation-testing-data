  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the calculated tile x coordinate to be 1 greater than the correct value, which would result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the calculated tile x coordinate to be 1 less than the correct value, which would result in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the calculated tile x coordinate to be twice as large as the correct value, which would result in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
