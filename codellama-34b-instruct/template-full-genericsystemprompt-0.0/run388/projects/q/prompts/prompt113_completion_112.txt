  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, whereas `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the `this` value bound to the first argument, whereas `call` and `apply` call the function with the specified `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` returns a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, whereas `call` and `apply` call the function with the specified `this` value.

DONE.
