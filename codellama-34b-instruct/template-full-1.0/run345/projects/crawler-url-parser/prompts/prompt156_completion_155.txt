  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*\/?)[\/]?$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses non-greedy quantifiers and the replacement code uses greedy quantifiers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\/[^\/]*(\/?)[\/]?$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses an erase allow once end-of-line anchor, and the replacement code uses an erase allow once beginning-of-line anchor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*\/?)[\/]?\z/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the \z metacharacter, which matches only at the end of the string, while the replacement code uses the \z metacharacter, which matches only at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
