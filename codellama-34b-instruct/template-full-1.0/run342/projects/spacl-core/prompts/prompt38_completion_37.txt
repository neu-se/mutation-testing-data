  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, spec.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only splits the `spec` string on `/` and returns the resulting array, while this modified code fragment also takes the length of the `spec` string into account, which could result in a different number of elements being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string on `/` and returns the resulting array, while this modified code fragment splits the `spec` string on `/` and returns a subset of the resulting array, starting from the second element and ending with the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only splits the `spec` string on `/`
