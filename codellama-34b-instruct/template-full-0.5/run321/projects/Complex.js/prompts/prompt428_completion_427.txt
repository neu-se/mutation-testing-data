  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable would always be truthy, and the `Math.pow` function would always return 10.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable would always be falsy, and the `Math.pow` function would always return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable would always be incremented by 1, and the `Math.pow` function would return a different value.

DONE.
