  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would not be called with the expected arguments, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would not be called with the expected arguments, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with the wrong arguments, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
