  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/", "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now a directory, not a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/", "/path/to/file"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now a file, not a directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/", ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now an empty string, not a file or directory.

DONE.
