  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` is a function that returns a country object, whereas `buildTimezone` is a function that returns a timezone object. Using `buildCountry` in this context would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a country object instead of a timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value that will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to false, which means that the `getTimezone` function will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object that will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true, which means that the `getTimezone` function will be called.

DONE.
