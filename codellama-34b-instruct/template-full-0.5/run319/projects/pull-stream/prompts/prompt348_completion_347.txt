  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a bound `this` context, which would cause the `test` function to be called with the wrong `this` context, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls the `test` function with the `null` context, which would cause the `test` function to be called with the wrong `this` context, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls the `test` function with the `null` context, which would cause the `test` function to be called with the wrong `this` context, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
