  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `abortCb` if `busy` is truthy, but this replacement calls it regardless of the value of `busy`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `abortCb` if `aborted` is truthy, but this replacement calls it regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `abortCb` if `aborted` is truthy and `busy` is falsy, but this replacement calls it regardless of the values of `aborted` and `busy`.

DONE.
