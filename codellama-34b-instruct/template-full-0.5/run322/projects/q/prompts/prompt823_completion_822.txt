  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, but the replaced code fragment throws an error regardless of the type of `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected = "Q can't apply finally callback";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only sets the `rejected` variable to `"Q can't apply finally callback"` if the `callback` is not a function, but the replaced code fragment sets `rejected` regardless of the type of `callback`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, but the replaced code fragment throws an error regardless of the type of `callback`.
