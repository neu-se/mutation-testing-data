  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the values object, while the modified code fragment returns the length of the values object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the values object, while the modified code fragment returns the length of the keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the values object, while the modified code fragment returns the first key of the object.

DONE.
