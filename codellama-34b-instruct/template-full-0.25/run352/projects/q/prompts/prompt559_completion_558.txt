  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a custom function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `instanceof` is a built-in JavaScript operator that checks if an object is an instance of a class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a custom function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.name` is a property that contains the name of the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.constructor.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a custom function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.constructor.name` is a property that contains the name of the constructor function that created the exception
