  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` if `end` is `true`, regardless of the value of `acc`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` if `acc` is `null`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` if `acc` is not `null`, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
