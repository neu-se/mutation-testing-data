 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.sin(θ), Math.cos(θ) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(φ1) + Math.cos(δ) * Math.sin(φ1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the wrong formula for calculating the bearing. The original formula calculates the bearing between two points on the Earth's surface, while this formula calculates the inverse tangent of the sine of θ divided by the cosine of θ multiplied by the sine of δ multiplied by the cosine of φ1 plus the cosine of δ multiplied by the sine of φ1, which is not equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(point, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the distance between the two points instead of the bearing. The original method calculates the bearing between two points, while this method calculates the distance between
