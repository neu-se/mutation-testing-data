  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `c` object as the first argument to `getCountry`, rather than passing the `c` object itself. This could cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[name], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `name` property of the `c` object as the first argument to `getCountry`, rather than passing the `c` object itself. This could cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(c.id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with the `id` property of the `c` object as the first argument, rather than passing the `c` object itself. This could cause the function to return a different country
