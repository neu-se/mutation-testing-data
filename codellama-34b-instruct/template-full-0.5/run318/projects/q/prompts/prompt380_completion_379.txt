  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that calls a function with a specified context and arguments, while `Q` is a library that provides a variety of functions for working with promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that takes an array of promises and returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in the array are fulfilled, while `Q` is a library that provides a variety of functions for working with promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise with a specified reason, while `Q` is a library that provides a variety of functions for working with promises.

DONE.
