  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would round the latitude and longitude values to a different precision, potentially changing the resulting `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would round the latitude and longitude values to a different precision, potentially changing the resulting `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would round the latitude and longitude values to a different precision, potentially changing the resulting `GeoPoint` object.

DONE.
