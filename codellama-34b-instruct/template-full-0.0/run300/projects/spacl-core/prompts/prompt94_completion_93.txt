  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the policy name, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name is not the same length as the input name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the policy name on spaces, and the `[0]` index would return the first element of the resulting array, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name contains spaces.

DONE.
