  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which inverts the truthiness of the expression. In this case, it would invert the truthiness of `data`, which could potentially cause the test to pass even if the `filter` function is not working correctly.

DONE.
