  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last path component from the page URL, which could cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last path component from the page URL and also remove any "default" file extension, which could cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "").replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, "")
