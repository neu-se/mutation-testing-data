  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `elem` is equal to `0`, but `elem + 1` would always be greater than `0`, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `elem` is equal to `0`, but `elem - 1` would always be less than `0`, so the `if` statement would always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `elem` is equal to `0`, but `elem * 2` would always be greater than `0`, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

DONE.
