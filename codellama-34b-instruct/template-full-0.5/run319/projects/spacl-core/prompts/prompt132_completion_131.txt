  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb2
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb2` is a different variable than `verb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "GET"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the `GET` verb, regardless of the value of `this.verbs[verb]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `this.verbs[verb]`, which could be different from the original value of `verb`.

DONE.
