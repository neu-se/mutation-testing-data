  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.trim()` would remove any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the `content` string, whereas the original code fragment `content` would not modify the string in any way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(1)` would remove the first character of the `content` string, whereas the original code fragment `content` would not modify the string in any way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace('foo', 'bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.replace('foo', 'bar')` would replace any instances of the string `'foo'` in the `content` string with the string `'bar'`, whereas the original code fragment `content` would not modify the string in any way.

DONE.
