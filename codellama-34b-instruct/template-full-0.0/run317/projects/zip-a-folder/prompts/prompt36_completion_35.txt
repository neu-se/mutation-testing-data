  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would close the output stream immediately, whereas `output` would continue to write to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write('')` would write an empty string to the output stream, whereas `output` would continue to write the compressed data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write(Buffer.from(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write(Buffer.from(''))` would write an empty buffer to the output stream, whereas `output` would continue to write the compressed data.

DONE.
