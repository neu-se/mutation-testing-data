  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1)) {
    return Complex.INFINITY;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Infinity, regardless of the input being zero or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](a)) {
    return Complex.INFINITY;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return Infinity only if the input is identical to the `a` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](b)) {
    return Complex.INFINITY;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return Infinity only if the input is identical to the `b` variable.

DONE.
