  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate backwards instead of forwards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate backwards and skip every other iteration.

DONE.
