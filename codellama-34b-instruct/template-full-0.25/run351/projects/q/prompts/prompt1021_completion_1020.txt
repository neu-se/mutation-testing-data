  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `post` method is expected to be a function, but `1` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `post` method is expected to be a function, but the function passed in this option does not have any side effects, so it will not cause any observable behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, function() { throw new Error("Test error"); }]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `post` method is expected to be a function, but the function passed in this option will throw an error, which will cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
