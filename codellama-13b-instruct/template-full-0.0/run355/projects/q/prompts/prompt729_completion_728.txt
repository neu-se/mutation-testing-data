  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the array of promises, rather than the array of promises itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array, rather than the array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, rather than the array of promises.

DONE.
