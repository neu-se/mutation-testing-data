  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var l
```
This would result in different behavior because `var l` is a different variable name than `var k`, so the loop would iterate over a different variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sinks) {
  exports[k] = sinks[k];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the `sinks` object, which has different properties than the original `sources` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sinks) {
  exports[k] = {}
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the `sinks` object, but the inner loop would not assign the correct value to `exports[k]`. Instead, it would assign an empty object.

DONE.
