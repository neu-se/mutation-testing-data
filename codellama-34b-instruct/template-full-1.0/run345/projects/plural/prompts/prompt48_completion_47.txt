  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ conjugate (\w1, "s" ) / i, function (w, regex) {
    return w + waves + ";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not take into account words that end in "conjugate" and would always add "s" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is already plural or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]e$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not take into account words that end in "y" and would always add "es" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is already plural or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^./, function(w, regex) { return w.replace(regex, rules.conjugate(w)) }
```
This would result in different behavior
