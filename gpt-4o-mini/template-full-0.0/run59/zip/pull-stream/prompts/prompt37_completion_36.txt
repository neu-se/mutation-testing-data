Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first argument instead of the fourth, potentially leading to incorrect results when the function is called with multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the fourth argument, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the `pull` function when it tries to access that argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a value that is one greater than the second argument instead of the fourth argument, which could lead to incorrect calculations or logic in the subsequent function calls.

DONE.
