  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "tiger" has been added to the list of words that should be pluralized as "tigers", but the code does not handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger|zebra)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "zebra" has been added to the list of words that should be pluralized as "zebras", but the code does not handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger|zebra
