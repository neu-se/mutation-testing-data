  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join `y` with `y` instead of `x` and `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(Q.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value of `x` instead of resolving it with the value of `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return Q.reject(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value of `x` instead of resolving it with the value of `y`.

DONE.
