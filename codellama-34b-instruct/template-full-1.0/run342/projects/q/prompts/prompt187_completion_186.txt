  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match(/^at <external>/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` method returns null if there are no matches, whereas `indexOf` method returns -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at")[1].trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the string at the first occurence of the substring "at", whereas the `indexOf` method would return the index of the first occurence of the substring "at".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(stackLine.indexOf("at")).trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` returns the portion of the string between the start index (inclusive) and the end index (exclusive), whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurence of the substring.

DONE.
