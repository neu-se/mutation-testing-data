  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be initialized with a negative value, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be initialized with a different value than expected, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be initialized with a different value than expected, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different length than expected.

DONE.
