  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is called on the `policy` object, whereas the original code fragment called the `matches` method on the `this` object. This could potentially cause different behavior if the `matches` method is overridden in a subclass of `Policy`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
