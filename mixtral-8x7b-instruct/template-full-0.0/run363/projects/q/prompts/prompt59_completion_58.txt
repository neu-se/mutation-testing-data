 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` would be set to `setImmediate` unconditionally, even in non-supporting environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` would be set to `setImmediate` unconditionally, even in non-supporting environments. The expression always evaluates to `true`, similar to using `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window !== "undefined" ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` would be set to `setImmediate` unconditionally, even in non-supporting environments. The expression always evaluates to `true`, regardless of the environment.

DONE.
