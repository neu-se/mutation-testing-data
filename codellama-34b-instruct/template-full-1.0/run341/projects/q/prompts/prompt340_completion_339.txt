  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return a fulfilled promise with the original resolution value, regardless of the state of the inspected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected" || inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return a rejected promise with the original rejection reason, regardless of the state of the inspected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return a pending promise, regardless of the state of the inspected value.

DONE.
