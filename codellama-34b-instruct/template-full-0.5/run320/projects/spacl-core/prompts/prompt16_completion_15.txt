  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative lookahead assertion `(?!$)` would prevent the regex from matching a string that ends with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?=.*\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the positive lookahead assertion `(?=.*\/)` would ensure that the string contains at least one slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?=\/.*)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the positive lookahead assertion `(?=\/.*)` would ensure that the string contains at least one slash at the beginning.

DONE.
