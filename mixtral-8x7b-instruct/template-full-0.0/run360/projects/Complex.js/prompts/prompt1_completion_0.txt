 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement `if (-b > x || x > b)` would always return false, causing the Taylor series approximation to be used regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(x) < 0
