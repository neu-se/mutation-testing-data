  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the complex conjugate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the complex conjugate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the complex conjugate.

DONE.
