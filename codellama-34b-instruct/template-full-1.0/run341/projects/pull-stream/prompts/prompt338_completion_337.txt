  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `field` is a function and `field + 1` would produce a new function that would be compared to `seen` instead of the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"field"
```
This would result in different behavior because "field" is a string and would not be compared to the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would produce a new string that would be compared to `seen` instead of the original values.

DONE.
