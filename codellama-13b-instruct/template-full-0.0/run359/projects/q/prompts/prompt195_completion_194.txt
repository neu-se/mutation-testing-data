  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the second element of the `attempt3` array instead of the third element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the first element of the `attempt3` array instead of the third element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the fourth element of the `attempt3` array instead of the third element.

DONE.
