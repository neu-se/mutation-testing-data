  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('error', reject)` event listener would be added to the `output` stream instead of the `zipArchive` stream, which could cause the error to be handled differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', () => reject(new Error('Archive error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('error', () => reject(new Error('Archive error')))` event listener would be added to the `output` stream instead of the `zipArchive` stream, which could cause the error to be handled differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', (err) => reject(err));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('error', (err) => reject(err))` event
