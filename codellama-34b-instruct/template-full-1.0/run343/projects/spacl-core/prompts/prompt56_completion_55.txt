  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, whereas the `replace` method returns the original string with the matches replaced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if a string contains another string, whereas the `replace` method replaces all occurrences of a pattern in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method checks if a string starts with another string, whereas the `replace` method replaces all occurrences of a pattern in a string.

DONE.
