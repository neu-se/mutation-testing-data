  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(`Timed out with ${timeout} ms`);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with `timeout` whereas the replacement code rejects the promise with a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(timeout);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use `notify()`, whereas the replacement code would call the `notifier` function if the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
deferred.resolve(object);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `clearTimeout()` and resolves the promise with `value` while the replacement code calls `clearTimeout()` and resolves the promise with `object`.
