  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the callback to be called with a different first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with two `null` arguments, which is different from the original behavior where the callback was called with one `null` argument and one `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error", data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with two arguments, `"error"` and `data`, instead of just one argument, `null`.

DONE.
