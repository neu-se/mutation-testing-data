  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, while `!hasNext()` returns the opposite boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` is the current position of the iterator, while `ops.length` is the total number of elements in the iterator. If the iterator is not at the end, `index` will be less than `ops.length`, but if the iterator is at the end, `index` will be equal to `ops.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next element in the iterator, while `0` is a constant value that is always less than any positive integer. If the iterator has more elements
