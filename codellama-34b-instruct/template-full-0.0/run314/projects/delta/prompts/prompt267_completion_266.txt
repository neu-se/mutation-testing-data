  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.delete` would delete the entire delta, whereas `retDelta.push` would push a new operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.retain` would retain the entire delta, whereas `retDelta.push` would push a new operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.concat` would concatenate the delta with another delta, whereas `retDelta.push` would push a new operation to the delta.

DONE.
