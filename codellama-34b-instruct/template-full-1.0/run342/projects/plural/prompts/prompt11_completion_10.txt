  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with "es" instead of "ies", which is the correct plural form for words that end in "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ys' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with "ys" instead of "ies", which is the correct plural form for words that end in "y".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with "s" instead of "ies", which is the correct plural form for words that end in "y".
