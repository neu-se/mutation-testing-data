  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `void 0` would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an additional argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an additional argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `undefined` would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an additional argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
