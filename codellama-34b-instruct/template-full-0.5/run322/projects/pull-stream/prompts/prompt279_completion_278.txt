  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.noSuchMethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.noSuchMethod()` would throw a `TypeError` if `prop` is not a function, whereas `prop` alone would simply return `undefined` if `prop` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.notAProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.notAProperty` would throw a `TypeError` if `prop` does not have a property named `notAProperty`, whereas `prop` alone would simply return `undefined` if `prop` does not have a property named `notAProperty`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.noSuchMethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.noSuchMethod()` would throw a `TypeError` if `prop` is not a function, whereas `prop` alone would simply return `undefined` if `prop` is not a function
