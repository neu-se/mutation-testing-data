  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This change will cause the function to return `cb(aborted)` when `aborted` is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && !busy
```
This change will cause the function to return `cb(aborted)` when `aborted` is `true` and `busy` is `false`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || busy
```
This change will cause the function to return `cb(aborted)` when `aborted` is `true` or `busy` is `true`, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
