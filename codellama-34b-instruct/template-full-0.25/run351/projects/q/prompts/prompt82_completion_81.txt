  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would not be called with the expected `task` argument, leading to unexpected behavior in the `nextTick.runAfter()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would not be called with the expected `task` argument, leading to unexpected behavior in the `nextTick.runAfter()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would not be called with the expected `task` argument, leading to unexpected behavior in the `nextTick.runAfter()` method.

DONE.
