  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` removes a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with a value of `null` would set the value of the key to `null`, whereas `delete` would remove the key entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` returns the value of the key, whereas `delete` removes the key entirely.

DONE.
