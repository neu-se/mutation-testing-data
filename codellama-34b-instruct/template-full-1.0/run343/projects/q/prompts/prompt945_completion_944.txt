  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the element to the beginning of the array, while `push` adds it to the end. This would cause the order of the arguments passed to `Q` to be reversed, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, while `push` adds a new element to the end. This would cause the number of arguments passed to `Q` to be different, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, while `push` adds a new element to the end. This would cause the order of the arguments passed to `Q` to be different, which could result in a different outcome.
