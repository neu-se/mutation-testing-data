  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` object is used to determine the context-dependent paths, and replacing it with `null` would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, even if the path matches the rule's regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` object is used to determine the context-dependent paths, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, even if the path matches the rule's regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` object is used to determine the context-dependent paths, and replacing it with an empty object would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, even if the path matches the rule's regular expression.

DONE.
