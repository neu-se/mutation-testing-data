  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.notify` with no arguments, while this replacement code fragment calls it with a null argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.notify` with no arguments, while this replacement code fragment calls it with an undefined argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.notify` with no arguments, while this replacement code fragment calls it with a zero argument.

DONE.
