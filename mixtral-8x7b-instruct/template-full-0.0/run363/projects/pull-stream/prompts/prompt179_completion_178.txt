 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false` instead of the value from the callback, even when there are no more elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the array without checking if the index is within the array's bounds, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the current element instead of the element itself, which could cause issues if the code relies on the returned value being the actual element.

DONE.
