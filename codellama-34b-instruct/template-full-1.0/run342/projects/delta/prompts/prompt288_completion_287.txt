  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a number, whereas `line.push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is a string, whereas `line.push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.concat(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.concat` is a method that concatenates two arrays, whereas `line.push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
