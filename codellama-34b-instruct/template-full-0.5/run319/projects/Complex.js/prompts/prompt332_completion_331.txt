  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this code fragment checks for greater than.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this code fragment checks for less than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this code fragment checks for equality with zero.

DONE.
