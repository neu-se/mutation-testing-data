  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by 1 millisecond, which would cause the promise to be rejected later than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by 1 millisecond, which would cause the promise to be resolved earlier than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be doubled, which would cause the promise to be rejected earlier than the original code.

DONE.
