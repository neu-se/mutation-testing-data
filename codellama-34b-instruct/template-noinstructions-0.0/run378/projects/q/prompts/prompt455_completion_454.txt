  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called, which would remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, even if it had not been handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called, which would add the promise to the `unhandledRejections` array, even if it had been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.emit` function to be called, which would emit an "unhandledRejection" event, even if the rejection had been handled.

DONE.
