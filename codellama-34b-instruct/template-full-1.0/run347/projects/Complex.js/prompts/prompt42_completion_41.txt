  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would calculate the difference of the squares of `a` and `b`, rather than the sum.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would calculate the square of the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than the sum of the squares.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would calculate the absolute value of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, rather than the sum of the squares themselves.

DONE.
