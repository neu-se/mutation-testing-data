  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 0 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator (>) to check if r is greater than 1, while this replacement code fragment uses the less-than operator (<) to check if r is less than 0. This would cause the function to return 0 instead of 1 if r is less than 0, which could result in incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator (>) to check if r is greater than 1, while this replacement code fragment multiplies r by 2. This would cause the function to return a different value if r is greater than 1, which could result in incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator (
