  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined for the `handler` object, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if it is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `transform` is reversed, and the method may behave differently depending on the order of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `priority` argument is negated, which may cause the method to behave differently depending on the value of `priority`.

DONE.
