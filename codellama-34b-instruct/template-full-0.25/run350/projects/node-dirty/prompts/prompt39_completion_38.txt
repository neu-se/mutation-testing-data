  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality. This means that if `fn(key, val)` returns a value that is not strictly equal to `false`, the `forEach` loop will continue to the next iteration, whereas in the original code, it would have stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!` operator, which negates the result of the `fn(key, val)` expression. This means that if `fn(key, val)` returns a value that is not strictly equal to `false`, the `forEach` loop will continue to the next iteration, whereas in the original code, it would have stopped.
