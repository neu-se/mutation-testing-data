Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.floor` instead of `Math.ceil` would round down the index to the nearest integer, potentially changing the selected quantile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `indices[r]` would shift the upper bound of the quantile selection, potentially including or excluding different elements in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because using the full length of the array `arr` instead of `indices[r]` would change the upper bound of the quantile selection to always be the end of the array, potentially affecting the accuracy of the calculated quantile.

DONE.
