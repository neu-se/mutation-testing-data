  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is `null` or `undefined`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `10` instead of `100` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 0.1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return `0.1` if `places` is `null` or `undefined`, causing the `Math.pow` function to return `10` instead of `100` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return `NaN` if `places` is `null` or `undefined`, causing the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN` instead of `10
