  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a `this` argument to be passed as the first parameter, whereas `apply` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound `this` value, whereas `apply` and `call` simply invoke the function with the specified `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, message)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments to be passed as the second parameter, whereas `call` expects a list of arguments.

DONE.
