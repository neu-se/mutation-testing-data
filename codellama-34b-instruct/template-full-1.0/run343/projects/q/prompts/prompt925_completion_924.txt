  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is not a method of the `Promise` object, but `defer` is defined globally and is used to create a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is not a method of the `Promise` object, but `makeNodeResolver` is defined globally and is used to create a function that can be used as a Node-style callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a method of the `Q` object, but it is not used as a constructor function and does not return a new deferred object.

DONE.
