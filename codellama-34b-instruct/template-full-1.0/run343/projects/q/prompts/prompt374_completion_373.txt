  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a promise, and the promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and the promise would be resolved with `null` value instead of the expected `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and the promise would be resolved with `undefined` value instead of the expected `exception` object.

DONE.
