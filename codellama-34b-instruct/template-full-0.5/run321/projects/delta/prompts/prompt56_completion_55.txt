  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `ops` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the given argument, while `ops` is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.map()
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array that is the result of applying the given function to each element of the original array, while `ops` is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
