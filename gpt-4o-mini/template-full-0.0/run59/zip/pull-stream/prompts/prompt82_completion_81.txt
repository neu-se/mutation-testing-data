Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `read` function with `null` and the callback `cb`, which may not handle the abort condition correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when aborting the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `false` instead of the expected `abort` value, which could cause the `read` function to behave incorrectly, as it may not interpret `false` as an abort signal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an empty function as the callback instead of the provided `cb`, which means that any logic that should occur after the read operation completes will not be executed, potentially leading to unhandled scenarios.

DONE.
