  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)) return "uplevel";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code considers a URL to be at the same level as the page URL if the link URL is a substring of the page URL, while the modified code considers it to be at a higher level if the link URL includes the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
