  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('abort')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `throw new Error('abort')` is an exception-throwing statement.

DONE.
