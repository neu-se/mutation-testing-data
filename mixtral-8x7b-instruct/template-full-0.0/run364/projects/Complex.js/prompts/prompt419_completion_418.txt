 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` check would always return false when the real part of the complex number is greater than or equal to 1, even if the imaginary part is also non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re * this.re + this.im * this.im === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, instead of checking if the magnitude of the complex number is zero. This would cause the function to return `Complex.INFINITY` even for non-zero complex numbers with a magnitude of zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re * this.re + this.im * this.im > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the magnitude of the complex number is greater than 1, instead of checking if it is zero.
