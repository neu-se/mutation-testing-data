This would result in different behavior because when `value` is undefined, the `resolvedPromise` function will throw an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected. However, when replaced with `undefined`, the function will return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because when `value` is 42, the `resolvedPromise` function will throw an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected. However, when replaced with `
