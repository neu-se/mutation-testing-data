  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'drain'` is never emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` is emitted immediately, instead of when the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'close'` is emitted immediately, instead of when the write stream is drained.

DONE.
