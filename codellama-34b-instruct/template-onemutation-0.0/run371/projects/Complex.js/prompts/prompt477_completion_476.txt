  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `false`, even if the complex number is finite. This is because the `isFinite` function checks whether the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both finite, but by using `this['im']` instead of `this['re']`, the imaginary part is being checked instead of the real part.
