  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise directly, instead of calling the `reject` method on the deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(rejected(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise with the value of `rejected(value)` and return it, instead of calling the `reject` method on the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise with the reason of `reason` and return it, instead of calling the `reject` method on the deferred object.

DONE.
