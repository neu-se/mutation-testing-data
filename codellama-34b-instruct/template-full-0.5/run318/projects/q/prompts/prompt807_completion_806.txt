  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the resolution of the given promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the resolution of the given promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, rather than using the existing one.

DONE.
