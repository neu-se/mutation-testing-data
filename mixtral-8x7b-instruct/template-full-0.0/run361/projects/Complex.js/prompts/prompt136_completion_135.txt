 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `this['isInfinite']()`, which is either `0` (for non-infinite numbers) or `Infinity` (for infinite numbers). This change would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even when the original condition should be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a non-zero imaginary part instead of checking if the number is infinite. This change would cause the condition to evaluate to `true` for any complex number with a non-zero imaginary part, even if the original condition should be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number is zero instead of checking if the number is infinite.
