Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store only the URL string of the currentUrl object instead of the entire object, potentially losing other important properties like `text` and `baseurl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ url: currentUrl.url, text: currentUrl.text }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with only the `url` and `text` properties, omitting any other properties that might be present in the `currentUrl` object, which could lead to incomplete data being stored in `urlMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.text = "default text";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object with a static string "default text", regardless of the actual text associated with the link, leading to incorrect or misleading information in the final output.

DONE.
