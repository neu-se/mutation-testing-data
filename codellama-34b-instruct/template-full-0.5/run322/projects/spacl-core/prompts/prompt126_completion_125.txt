  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code checks if it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.prop === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code checks if `ctx.prop` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `match[index + 1]` is equal to `prop`, while the new code checks if they are not equal.

DONE.
