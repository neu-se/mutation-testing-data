  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` argument would be `null` instead of an `Error` object. This could cause the `if (!cbs.length && err != null)` check to fail, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Error` object would be created instead of using the existing `err` object. This could cause the `if (!cbs.length && err != null)` check to fail, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` argument would be `undefined` instead of an `Error` object. This could cause the `if (!cbs.length && err != null)` check to fail, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
