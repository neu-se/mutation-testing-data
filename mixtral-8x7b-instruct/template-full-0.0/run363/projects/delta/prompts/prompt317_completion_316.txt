 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER> || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object if `op.retain` is falsy, instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER> || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 0 if `op.retain` is falsy, instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER> ?? {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if `op.retain` is `null` or `undefined`, instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
