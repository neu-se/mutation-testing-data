  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `a + b` expression, which is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `a * b` expression, which is the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

DONE.
