  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the key as an argument to the `delete` method, while this code passes both the key and value as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the value as a separate argument to the `delete` method, while this code passes it as a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the value as a separate argument to the `delete` method, while this code passes `undefined` as the value.

DONE.
