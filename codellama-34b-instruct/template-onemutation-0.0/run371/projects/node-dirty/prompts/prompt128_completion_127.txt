  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is a method that unblocks the stream, allowing data to flow through it, while `cork` is a method that blocks the stream, preventing data from flowing through it. In the original code, `cork` is used to block the stream while data is being written to it, and `uncork` is used to unblock the stream after the data has been written. By replacing `cork` with `uncork`, the stream would be unblocked even before the data is written to it, which could result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
