  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be decremented instead of incremented, which could cause the loop to run for a different number of iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j++
```
This would result in different behavior because `j` is not defined in the current scope, so this would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length--
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a constant that is used to determine the last index of the `arguments` array, and decrementing it would cause the loop to run for a different number of iterations.

DONE.
