  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the given substring. In this case, `startsWith` would return `false` for the input `sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd` and `sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc`, while `includes` would return `true`.

DONE.
