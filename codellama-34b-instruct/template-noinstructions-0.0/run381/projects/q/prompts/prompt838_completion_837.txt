  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the rejection reason as its argument, but it would not be able to handle the rejection because it is not a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function () {
    throw new Error("Unhandled rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than the original rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function (reason) {
    return Q.reject(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would return a new rejected promise with the original rejection reason, rather than the `onUnhandledError` function
