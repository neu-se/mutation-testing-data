  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args === null` is a strict equality check, while `args == null` is a loose equality check that would return `true` for both `null` and `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args !== null` is a strict inequality check, while `args == null` is a loose equality check that would return `false` for both `null` and `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args == undefined` is a loose equality check that would return `true` for both `null` and `undefined`, while `args == null` is a loose equality check that would only return `true` for `null`.

DONE.
