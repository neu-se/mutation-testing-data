  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the policy to be evaluated in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the original array, starting from the specified index (in this case, 1). This could cause the policy to be evaluated on a different set of rules than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.filter((rule) => rule.name === 'allow')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function checks if the rule name is equal to 'allow', which could cause the policy to be evaluated on a different set of rules than expected.
