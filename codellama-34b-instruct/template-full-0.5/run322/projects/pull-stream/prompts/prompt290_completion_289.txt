  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `field` property in the input object, while this modified code fragment checks for the presence of the `field + 1` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `field` property in the input object, while this modified code fragment checks for the presence of the `field.toUpperCase()` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `field` property in the input object, while this modified code fragment checks for the presence of the `field.length` property.

DONE.
