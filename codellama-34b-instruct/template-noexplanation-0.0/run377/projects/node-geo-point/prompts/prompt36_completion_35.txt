  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad) * 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this method.

DONE.
