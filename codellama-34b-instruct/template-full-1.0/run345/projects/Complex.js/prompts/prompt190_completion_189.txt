  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z['re'] % 2 + 2) % 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the modulo operator from 4 to 2, which would affect the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z['re'] * 2 + 2) % 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the modulo operator from 4 to 2, which would affect the result of the expression.

DONE.
