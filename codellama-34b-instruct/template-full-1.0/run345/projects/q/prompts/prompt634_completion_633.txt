  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
Q.reject(origin, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
Q.delay(origin, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the return value of `origin.dispatch("delete", args)` after a delay, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
Q.defer(origin, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by `origin.dispatch("delete", args)`, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
