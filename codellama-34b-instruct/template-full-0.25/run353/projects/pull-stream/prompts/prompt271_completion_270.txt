  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` is a different property than `values`, and it may not be a function that can be called with the same arguments as `values`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream[values]
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream[values]` is a different property than `values`, and it may not be a function that can be called with the same arguments as `values`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.stream
```
This would result in different behavior because `values.stream` is a different property than `values`, and it may not be a function that can be called with the same arguments as `values`.

DONE.
