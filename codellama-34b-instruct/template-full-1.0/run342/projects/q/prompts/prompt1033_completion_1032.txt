  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the `error` object, while the replacement logs `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the `error` object, while the replacement logs the number `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the `error` object, while the replacement logs the string `"error"`.

DONE.
