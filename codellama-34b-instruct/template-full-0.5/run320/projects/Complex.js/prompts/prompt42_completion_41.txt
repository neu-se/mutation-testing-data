  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, but this replacement uses subtraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, but this replacement uses multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, but this replacement uses multiplication.

DONE.
