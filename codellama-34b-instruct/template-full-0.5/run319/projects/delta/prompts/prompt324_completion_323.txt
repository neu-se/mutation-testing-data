  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is subtracted from `baseIndex`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip over the first `length` characters of the current line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is multiplied by 2 before being added to `baseIndex`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip over every other character of the current line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to start from the second character of the current line instead of the first.

DONE.
