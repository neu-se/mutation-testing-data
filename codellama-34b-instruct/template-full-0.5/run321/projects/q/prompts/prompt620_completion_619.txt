  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the `set` operation, but the `set` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the `get` operation, but the `get` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the `delete` operation, but the `delete` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
