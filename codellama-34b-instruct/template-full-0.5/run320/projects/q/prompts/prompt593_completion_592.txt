  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is similar to `apply`, but it does not accept an array of arguments. Instead, it requires each argument to be passed as a separate parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original `callback` function with a specific `this` value and arguments that are partially applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.caller
```
This would result in different behavior because `caller` is a property that returns the function that invoked the current function. It is not a function that can be called directly.

DONE.
