  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData as number + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the number of characters to retain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData as string + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ ' '` would change the string value to retain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData as string + 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 'abc'` would change the string value to retain.

DONE.
