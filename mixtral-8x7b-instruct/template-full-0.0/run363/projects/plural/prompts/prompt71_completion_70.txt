 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added 'cellos' as a special case for a single word, while this change would make it the general rule for all words ending in 'o'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any word ending in 'o', not just the special case 'cello'. This could lead to incorrect pluralization for words that should follow different rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append 's' to the input word, ignoring any existing rules. This could lead to incorrect pluralization for words that should follow different rules.

DONE.
