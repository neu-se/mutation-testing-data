  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2grad
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2grad` is a different function that converts degrees to gradians, which is a different angular measurement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radians
```
This would result in different behavior because `radians` is a different function that converts degrees to radians, which is a different angular measurement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.PI/180)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(Math.PI/180)` is a different constant that represents the conversion factor from degrees to radians.

DONE.
