  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.slice(1)` would return the substring of `path` starting from the second character, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.substring(1)` would return the substring of `path` starting from the second character, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.substr(1)` would return the substring of `path` starting from the second character, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

DONE.
