  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `arguments` directly, which is a special object that contains all the arguments passed to a function, whereas the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which creates a new array containing all the arguments except the first one. This could potentially change the behavior of the function if the first argument is used in the function's logic.

DONE.
