  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be an object, but `null` is not an object and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be defined, but `undefined` is not defined and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be an object with properties, but `{}` is an empty object and would cause the function to return an empty stream.

DONE.
