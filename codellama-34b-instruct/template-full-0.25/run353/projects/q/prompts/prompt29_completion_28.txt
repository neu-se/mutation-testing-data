  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the loop to run one extra time, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the loop to run one fewer time, potentially missing a task in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the loop to run twice as many times, potentially leading to duplicate tasks being executed.

DONE.
