 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 20)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose a zoom level between 0 and 19, instead of using the provided `zoom` level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a zoom level of 1, regardless of the provided `zoom` level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that the `coordinate` object has a property called `zoom`, which it does not. This would cause an error and the function would not return a `Tile` object.

DONE.
