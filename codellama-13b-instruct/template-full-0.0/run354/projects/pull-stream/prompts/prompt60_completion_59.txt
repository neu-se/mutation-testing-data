  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = function (err, cb) {
  if('function' == typeof err)
    cb = err, err = true
  abort = err || true
  if(read) return read(abort, cb || function () {})
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink.abort` function is now defined as a function expression, rather than a function declaration. This could potentially cause issues if the function is called before it is defined, or if it is called in a different context than the one in which it was defined.
