  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` will replace all occurrences of the search string, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will remove the first character of the string, whereas `replace` will replace the first occurrence of the search string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` will extract a substring starting from the first character, whereas `replace` will replace the first occurrence of the search string.

DONE.
