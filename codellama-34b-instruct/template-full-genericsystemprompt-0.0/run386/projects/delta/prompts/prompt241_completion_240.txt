  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the length, which could cause the algorithm to skip over a character or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract an extra character from the length, which could cause the algorithm to skip over a character or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
