  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' to words that end in 'o', while this new code fragment adds an 's' to words that end in 'o'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' to words that end in 'o', while this new code fragment adds 'ies' to words that end in 'o'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'y' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' to words that end in 'o', while this new
