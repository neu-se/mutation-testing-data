  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new Delta object with a subset of the original ops, while `concat` returns a new Delta object with the concatenation of the two original ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.compose(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` returns a new Delta object with the result of composing the two original ops, while `concat` returns a new Delta object with the concatenation of the two original ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.diff(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because `diff` returns a new Delta object with the result of diffing the two original ops, while `concat` returns a new Delta object with the concatenation of the two original ops.

DONE.
