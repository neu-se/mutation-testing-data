  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'boolean' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the test is checking for a boolean value instead of a number, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test is checking for a negative number instead of a positive number, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the test is checking for NaN instead of a number, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
