 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting promise would always resolve to `null`, regardless of the value of `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting promise would always resolve to `1`, regardless of the value of `result.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting promise would always resolve to a value that is one greater than `result.value`.

DONE.
