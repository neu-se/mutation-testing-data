  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

DONE.
