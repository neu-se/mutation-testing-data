  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked whether `rejected` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks whether `rejected` is both truthy and `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked whether `rejected` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks whether `rejected` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked whether `rejected` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks whether `rejected` is truthy or `false`.

DONE.
