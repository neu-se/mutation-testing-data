  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `[]` is an empty array. The `all` function would return a promise that is immediately resolved with an empty array, rather than waiting for the promises in the input array to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `null` is a null value. The `all` function would return a promise that is immediately rejected with a `TypeError`, rather than waiting for the promises in the input array to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `undefined` is an undefined value. The `all` function would return a promise that is immediately rejected with a `TypeError`, rather than waiting for the
