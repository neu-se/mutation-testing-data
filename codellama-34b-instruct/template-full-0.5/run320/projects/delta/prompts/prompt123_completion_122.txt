  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a less-than operator, while this option uses a less-than-or-equal-to operator. This would cause the loop to iterate one additional time, potentially leading to an off-by-one error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a logical AND operator, while this option uses a logical OR operator. This would cause the loop to iterate more times than necessary, potentially leading to a performance issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a logical AND operator, while this option uses a logical NOT operator. This would cause the loop to iterate fewer times than necessary, potentially leading to a bug.

DONE.
