  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, which would cause the `Infinity / Infinity = NaN` check to be skipped, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.hasOwnProperty('isZero')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `isZero` property exists on the `z` object, rather than checking if the function is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isReal && z.isZero
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of `z` is `0`, rather than checking if the entire number is `0`.

DONE.
