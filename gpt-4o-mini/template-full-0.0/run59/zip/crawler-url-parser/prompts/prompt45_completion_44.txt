Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the parsing options to not use the default behavior of treating the URL as a relative URL and not allowing the URL to be parsed as a query string, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `currentUrlStr` instead of `baseUrlStr`, which would lead to parsing the current URL instead of the base URL, potentially resulting in incorrect URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + 'invalid', true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an invalid string to `baseUrlStr`, which would cause the URL parsing to fail or produce an unexpected result, leading to incorrect URL handling in the subsequent logic.

DONE.
