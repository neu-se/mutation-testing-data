  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.nok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.nok()` is a function that does not exist in the original code, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.nok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.nok()` is a function that does not exist in the original code, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.ok()` is a function that does not exist in the original code, so it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
