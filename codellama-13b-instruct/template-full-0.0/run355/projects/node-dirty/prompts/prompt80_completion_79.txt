  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and the `else` block would not be executed.

DONE.
