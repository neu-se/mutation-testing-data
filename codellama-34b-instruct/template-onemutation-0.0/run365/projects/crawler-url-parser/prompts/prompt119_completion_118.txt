  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.protocol` is a string representing the protocol of the URL, while `baseUrl` is an object containing various properties of the URL. Using `baseUrl.protocol` would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect classification of the link type.
