Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row detected: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message changes, which may affect how the error is logged or handled downstream, potentially leading to confusion about the nature of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${this._data.size}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `this._data.size` instead of `buffer`, which means the error message will not reflect the actual corrupted data but rather the size of the data structure, leading to misleading information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.length}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it reports the length of the buffer instead of its content, which does not provide useful information about the corrupted row itself, making it harder to diagnose the issue.

DONE.
