  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over every other element in the `answerPs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over every other element in the `answerPs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every other element in the `answerPs` array, but the increment would be doubled.

DONE.
