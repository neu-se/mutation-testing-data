  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value to the `dispatch` method, instead of `void 0`, which would change the context in which the method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a copy of the `args` array instead of the original array, which would change the values that are passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array in reverse order instead of the original order, which would change the values that are passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
