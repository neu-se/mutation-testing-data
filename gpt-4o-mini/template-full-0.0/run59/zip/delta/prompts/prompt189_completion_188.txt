Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the attributes of the new operation to `null`, potentially losing important metadata that should be preserved during the composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = thisOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assign the attributes of the `thisOp` to the `newOp`, ignoring the attributes of the `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect behavior when composing operations that should have different attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...otherOp.attributes, ...thisOp.attributes };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of both operations instead of preserving the intended behavior of choosing attributes based on the type of operation, which could lead to unexpected results in the composed operation.

DONE.
