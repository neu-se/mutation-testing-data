  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred promise with the value returned by the `setTimeout` function, while the modified code fragment resolves the deferred promise with the value of the `value` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the deferred promise with the error returned by the `setTimeout` function, while the modified code fragment rejects the deferred promise with the error of the `error` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment notifies the deferred promise with the value returned by the `setTimeout` function, while the modified code fragment notifies the deferred promise with the value of the `value` variable.

DONE.
