 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the code relies on the behavior of the array\_slice function, which might handle certain edge cases or custom objects differently than the Array global's slice method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the array\_slice function with null, which would cause a TypeError when trying to call a null or undefined value as a function. This would expose any tests that do not properly handle exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('array_slice is not supported'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the array\_slice function with a function that throws an error. This would expose any tests that do not properly handle errors or do not test
