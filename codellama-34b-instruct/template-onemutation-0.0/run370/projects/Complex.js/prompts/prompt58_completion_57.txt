  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['r']) || Number.isFinite(a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||`, which only requires one condition to be true. This change would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called more frequently, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
