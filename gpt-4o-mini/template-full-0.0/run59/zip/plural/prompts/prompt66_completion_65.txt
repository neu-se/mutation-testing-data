Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/memo$/, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the rule to match only words that end with "memo" and appends 's', which would incorrectly pluralize "memo" to "memos" only if it ends with "memo", ignoring other potential pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/memo/, 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a non-anchored regex, which would match any occurrence of "memo" in a word, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization of words that contain "memo" as a substring, rather than just matching the whole word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/memo$/, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pluralization rule to append 'es' instead of 's', which is incorrect for the word "memo", as the correct plural form is "memos".

DONE.
