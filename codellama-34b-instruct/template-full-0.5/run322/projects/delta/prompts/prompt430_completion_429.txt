  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `index` property instead of the `offset` property, which could potentially cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `offset` property, which could potentially cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.ops.length - this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `length` property of the `ops` array instead of the `offset` property, which could potentially cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value.

DONE.
