 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || err
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands for the logical OR operator affects the short-circuit evaluation. In this case, `abort` would always be evaluated first, and if it's truthy, `err` would not be evaluated, potentially hiding errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && err
