 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` would always be set to `false` instead of invoking the descriptor method, potentially causing the promise to always resolve or reject, depending on the `fallback` behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor['op']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the 'op' property of the descriptor object instead of using the dynamic value of the `op` variable, which would cause the promise to behave differently or even throw an error if the 'op' property does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this[op]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `op` property of the current context (the promise object), which would cause the promise to behave differently or even throw an error if the `op` property does not exist in the promise object.

DONE.
