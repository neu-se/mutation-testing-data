  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the value of `progress` by 1, which would change the behavior of the `notify` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the value of `progress` by 1, which would change the behavior of the `notify` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the value of `progress`, which would change the behavior of the `notify` method.

DONE.
