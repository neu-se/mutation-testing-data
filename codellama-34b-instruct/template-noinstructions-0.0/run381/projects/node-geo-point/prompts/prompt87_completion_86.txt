  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(δ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance, while this replacement uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(δ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the angular distance, while this replacement uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(δ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `tan` function to calculate the tangent of the angular distance, while this replacement uses the `tan` function to calculate the tangent of the latitude.

DONE.
