  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i ++] === value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the value of the next element in the array, whereas the original code fragment checks the value of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i + 1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of the next element in the array is undefined, whereas the original code fragment checks if the value of the current element is equal to the `value` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] != value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of the current element is not equal to the `value` variable, whereas the original code fragment checks if it is equal.

DONE.
