  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` rejects the promise, while `deferred.resolve` resolves it, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` expects to be called with an Error object or a string as an argument, while `null` is not an Error object or a string, which could cause the test to fail even if the code is working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that expects to be called with an Error object or a string as an argument, while `Q.reject` is a function that expects to be called with a promise that has been rejected or a value such as an Error object or a string, which could
