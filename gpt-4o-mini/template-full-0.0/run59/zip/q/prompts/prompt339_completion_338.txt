Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected = inspect("some invalid argument");
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an invalid argument to the `inspect` function, which may lead to unexpected results or errors, potentially causing the promise to behave incorrectly when checking its state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected = inspect();
inspected.state = "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it manually sets the `state` of the inspected promise to "fulfilled", which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's value and state, allowing it to resolve incorrectly even if it was actually still pending or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected = inspect();
return inspected.value + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the return value by adding 1 to the resolved value, which could lead to incorrect results being returned from the promise, altering the expected behavior of the promise chain.

DONE.
