  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `null` is an object. In the original code, `name === null || name === void 0` checks for both `null` and `undefined`, but `name === undefined` only checks for `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` performs type coercion, so `name == null` would return `true` if `name` is either `null` or `undefined`. In the original code, `name === null || name === void 0` checks for both `null` and `undefined` without type coercion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` performs type coercion, so `name != null` would return `false` if `name` is either `null` or `undefined`.
