  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of "//" with "http://", whereas this code fragment replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//g, "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of "//" with "http://", whereas this code fragment replaces all occurrences with "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//g, "ftp://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of "//" with "http://", whereas this code fragment replaces all occurrences with "ftp://", which would change the protocol of the URL.

DONE.
