  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `once` function is called with the `end` argument, which is either `true` or a non-null object. However, if `null` is passed instead, the `once` function would not be called, and the stream would not be properly ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `once` function is called with the `end` argument, which is either `true` or a non-null object. However, if `undefined` is passed instead, the `once` function would not be called, and the stream would not be properly ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
