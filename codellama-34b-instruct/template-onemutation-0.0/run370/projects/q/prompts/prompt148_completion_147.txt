  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return `false` even if the exception is a `StopIteration` object.
