 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty array instead of slicing the `base` Delta, causing unexpected results or errors in the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.ops.slice(index, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only slices one operation instead of the desired range of operations, causing incorrect transformation results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.ops.splice(index, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `base.ops` array by removing the elements at the specified index, causing unexpected side effects and incorrect transformation results.

DONE.
