  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would treat the first element of the `args` array as a promise, rather than the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would omit the first element of the `args` array, rather than treating the entire `args` array as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would create a new promise that resolves to the `args` array, rather than treating the `args` array as a promise.
DONE.
