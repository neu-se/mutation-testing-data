  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different method than `reject`, and it would result in the promise being resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a different method than `reject`, and it would result in the promise being notified instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different method than `reject`, and it would result in the promise being resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
