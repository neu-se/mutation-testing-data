  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `global.Q` to `previousQ`, but it would not create a new `Q` object as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign an empty object to `global.Q` and `previousQ`, but it would not create a new `Q` object as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a function to `global.Q` and `previousQ`, but it would not create a new `Q` object as the original code does.

DONE.
