Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.html$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically matches URLs ending with "index.html" instead of any file type that ends with "index." followed by any extension, potentially missing other valid index files like "index.php" or "index.asp".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]{3}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the match to only three-letter file extensions for "default" files, whereas the original regex allows for any length of file extension, which could lead to missing valid "default" files with longer extensions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]{2,4}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the match to allow only file extensions that are between 2 to 4 characters long, which could exclude valid extensions like ".html5" or ".jpeg" that may be relevant in certain contexts.

DONE.
