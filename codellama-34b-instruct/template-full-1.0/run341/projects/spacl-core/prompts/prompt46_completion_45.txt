  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```part.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.test` will return a boolean value indicating whether the pattern in `part` matches the given string, whereas `part.match` will return an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.split` will return an array of substrings obtained by splitting the given string on the specified separator, whereas `part.match` will return an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.length` will return the length of the given string, whereas `part.match` will return an array of matches.

DONE.
