  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isInfinite()` method, causing the `if` statement to execute even if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite()` method checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, which is the opposite of what the `isInfinite()` method does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` method checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), which is different from checking if it is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
