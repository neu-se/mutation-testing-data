  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the inverse hyperbolic sine function, which is different from `cosh` which is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosech
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosech` is the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function, which is different from `cosh` which is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `1/sinh` is the inverse of the hyperbolic sine function, which is different from `cosh` which is the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
