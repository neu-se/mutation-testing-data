  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null, function (error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will always throw an error, regardless of whether the original promise was resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function () {}, function (error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will always throw an error, but the returned promise will be resolved with an empty value, regardless of whether the original promise was resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null, function () { return Q(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will always return a resolved promise with the original value, regardless of whether the original promise was resolved or rejected.

DONE.
