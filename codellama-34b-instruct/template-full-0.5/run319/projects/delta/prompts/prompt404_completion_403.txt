  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `otherData`, which could cause the `transform` method to behave differently when handling operations with retain values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `thisData` instead of `otherData`, which could cause the `transform` method to behave differently when handling operations with retain values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the retain value to `null`, which could cause the `transform` method to behave differently when handling operations with retain values.

DONE.
