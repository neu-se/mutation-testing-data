  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is a different value than `sinφ2`, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is a different value than `cosφ2`, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanθ
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanθ` is a different value than `sinθ`, which is used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
