  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, so the result of the expression would be a random number between 0 and `Math.sqrt`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(Math.sqrt)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of its argument, so the result of the expression would be the absolute value of `Math.sqrt`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.abs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` takes a number as its argument, but `Math.abs` is a function, so the expression would result in a type error.

DONE.
