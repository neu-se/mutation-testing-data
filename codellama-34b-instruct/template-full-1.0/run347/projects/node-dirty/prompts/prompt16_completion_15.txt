  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear(key, cbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all entries from the map, whereas `set()` replaces or inserts an entry with the given key and value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` removes an entry with the given key from the map, whereas `set()` replaces or inserts an entry with the given key and value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.forEach((key, cbs) => console.log(key, cbs))
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach()` calls the specified callback function with each entry in the map, whereas `set()` replaces or inserts an entry with the given key and value.

DONE.
