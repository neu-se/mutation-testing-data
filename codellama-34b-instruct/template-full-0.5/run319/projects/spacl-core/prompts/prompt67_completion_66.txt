  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the policy to be evaluated in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the array, starting from the specified index. If the policy is evaluated using this modified array, it may not include the expected rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.name === 'admin')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the provided predicate function. In this case, the policy would only be evaluated for rules with the name 'admin'.

DONE.
