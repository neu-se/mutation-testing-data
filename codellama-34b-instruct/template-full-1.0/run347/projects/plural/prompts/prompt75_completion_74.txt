  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 's' to 'Die' would produce 'Dies', 
which is not a valid plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because 100 is not a string and cannot be transformed 
into a plural form using the string methods used in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'Hello' is not a valid input for the plural function 
and would be treated as 'undefined', which would produce an incorrect output.

DONE.
