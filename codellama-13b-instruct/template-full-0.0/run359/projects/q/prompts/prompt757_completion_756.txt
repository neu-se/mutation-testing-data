  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` method returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises, while the `allSettled` method returns a promise that is resolved with an array of states (as returned by `inspect`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method returns a promise that is resolved with an array of values, while the `allResolved` method returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` method returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first resolved promise, while the `allResolved` method returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

DONE.
