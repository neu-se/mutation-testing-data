 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is an internal method that bypasses the regular dispatch mechanism, potentially causing issues with promise resolution or rejection handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).thenDispatch
