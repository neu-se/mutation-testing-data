  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 'Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different. The original code raises an error with the message "Empty lines never appear in a healthy database" whereas the new code raises an error with the message "Empty lines never appear in a healthy database".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('This is a new error!')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different. The original code raises an error with the message "Empty lines never appear in a healthy database" whereas the new code raises an error with the message "This is a new error!".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is a syntax error and would throw an error, whereas the original code does not throw an error.

DONE.
