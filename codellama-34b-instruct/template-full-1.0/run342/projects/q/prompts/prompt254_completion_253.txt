  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` array only has one element, and `message[0]` would evaluate to `undefined`, whereas `message` would evaluate to the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.pop()` would remove and return the last element of the `message` array, whereas `message` would still refer to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice(1)` would create a new array containing all the elements of `message` except the first one, whereas `message` would still refer to the original array.

DONE.
