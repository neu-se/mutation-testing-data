  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, whereas the replaced code checks if the imaginary part of `z` is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0 && z['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, whereas the replaced code checks if the imaginary part of `z` is zero and the real part is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, whereas the replaced code checks if the real part of `z` is greater than zero and the imaginary part is zero.

DONE.
