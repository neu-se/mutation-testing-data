Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate to true when checking for `Infinity / Infinity`, leading to a return of `Complex['NAN']` even when both values are not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `this['isInfinite']()` is true and `z['re']` is infinite, which is not the intended logic for handling the case of `Infinity / Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the imaginary part of the current complex number is infinite instead of checking if the divisor is infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results when dividing complex numbers.

DONE.
