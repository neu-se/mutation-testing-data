 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would continue to be called even when `abort` is true, potentially causing unexpected behavior or infinite loops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback passed to `read` would be `undefined` instead of a function, causing an error in the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback passed to `read` would always be the value of `done`, even if it is not a function, causing an error in the `read` function.

DONE.
