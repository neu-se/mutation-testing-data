  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the next operation plus one, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the next operation minus one, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return zero, regardless of the length of the current operation.

DONE.
