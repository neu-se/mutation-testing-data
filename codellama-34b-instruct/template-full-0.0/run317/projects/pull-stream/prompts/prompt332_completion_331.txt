  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. This change would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. This change would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `true` is a boolean value that is always true. This change would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.
