  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object if the stream is aborted, while `null` is a null value that does not represent an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object if the stream is aborted, while `undefined` is a value that is not defined and does not represent an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object if the stream is aborted, while `new Error()` creates a new error object that is not the same as the original error object.

DONE.
