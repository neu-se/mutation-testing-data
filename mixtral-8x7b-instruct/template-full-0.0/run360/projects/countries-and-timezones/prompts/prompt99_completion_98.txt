 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of an object's own enumerable property values, not the keys. This change would cause issues in the `deliverTimezones` function, which expects an object with timezone keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones.keys()` would return an iterator for the keys of the `timezones` property of the `data` object. However, the `deliverTimezones` function expects an object with timezone keys, not an iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['a', 'b', 'c']
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the `Object.keys` call with a hardcoded array would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to always return an object with the same
