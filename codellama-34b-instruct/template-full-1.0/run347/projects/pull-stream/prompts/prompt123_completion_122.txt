  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `end`, potentially causing the function to return `true` when it should not.
DONE.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate the `end` variable and return `false` if it is truthy, potentially causing the function to return `false` when it should return `true`.
DONE.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate the `end` variable and return `true` if it is truthy, potentially causing the function to return `true` when it should not.
DONE.
