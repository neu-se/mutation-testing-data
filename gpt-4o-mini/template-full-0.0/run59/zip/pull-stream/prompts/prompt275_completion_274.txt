Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `stream` with `null` would cause the `nextStream` function to set `_read` to `null`, leading to a situation where the stream is not properly initialized, potentially causing errors when trying to read from it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `stream` would also result in `_read` being set to an undefined value, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the code attempts to call `_read` later, as it would not be a valid function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'not_a_function'
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `stream` with a string that is not a function would cause the subsequent checks and calls to `_read` to fail, as the code expects `_read` to be a callable function, leading to runtime errors when trying to invoke it.

DONE.
