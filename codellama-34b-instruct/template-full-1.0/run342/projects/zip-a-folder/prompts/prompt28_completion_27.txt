  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is emitted when the `output` stream has been closed, while `close` is emitted when the `output` stream has been closed and the data has been flushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because `finish` is emitted when all the data has been flushed to the underlying system, while `end` is emitted when the `output` stream has been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `close` is emitted when the `output` stream has been closed, while `finish` is emitted when all the data has been flushed to the underlying system.

DONE.
