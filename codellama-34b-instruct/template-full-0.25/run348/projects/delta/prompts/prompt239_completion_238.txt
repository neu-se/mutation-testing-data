  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of characters to delete, and adding 1 to it would cause the code to delete one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of characters to delete, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the code to delete one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of characters to delete, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the code to delete twice as many characters as intended.

DONE.
