  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length && err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `err` is not `null`, regardless of the length of `cbs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `err` is not `null`, regardless of the length of `cbs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `err` is not `null` and `cbs` is not empty, regardless of the length of `cbs`.

DONE.
