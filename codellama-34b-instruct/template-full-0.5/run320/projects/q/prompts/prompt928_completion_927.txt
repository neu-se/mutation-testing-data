  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `arguments` is a special keyword that refers to the arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid expression that evaluates to `null`, whereas `arguments` is a special keyword that refers to the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a special keyword that refers to the current object context, whereas `arguments` is a special keyword that refers to the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
