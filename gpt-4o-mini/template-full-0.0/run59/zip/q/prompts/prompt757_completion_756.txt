Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolvedPromises"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the name of the function being referenced, which would lead to a runtime error when trying to call `allResolvedPromises`, as it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly references the `allSettled` function instead of `allResolved`, which would cause the function to behave as if it were returning the results of `allSettled`, potentially leading to incorrect promise resolution behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolved()"
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `allResolved` function immediately instead of passing its name as a string, which would lead to an error if `allResolved` is not invoked correctly in the context of the `deprecate` function.

DONE.
