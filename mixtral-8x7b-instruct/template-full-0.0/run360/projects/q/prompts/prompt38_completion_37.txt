 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.Q.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `exit` method on the `Q` global, rather than on the `domain` object as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown when `runSingle` is called, as it expects a function as the `task` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
