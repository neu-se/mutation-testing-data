  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string matches the pattern, while the new code fragment checks if it does not match the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string matches the pattern, while the new code fragment checks if the result of the match is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string matches the pattern, while the new code fragment checks if the result of the match is not null and not undefined.

DONE.
