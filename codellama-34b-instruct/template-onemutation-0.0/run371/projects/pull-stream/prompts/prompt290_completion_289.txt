  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!field
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which inverts the truthiness of the expression. In this case, it would invert the truthiness of `field`, which would cause the function to pass through items that were previously filtered out, and vice versa.

DONE.
