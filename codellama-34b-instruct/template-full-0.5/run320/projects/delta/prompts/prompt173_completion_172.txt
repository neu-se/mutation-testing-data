  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the current operation in the this iterator, minus one, rather than the length of the next operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the next operation in the other iterator, plus one, rather than the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

DONE.
