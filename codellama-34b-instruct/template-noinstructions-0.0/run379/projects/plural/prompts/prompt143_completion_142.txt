  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is a keyword in JavaScript that returns the type of a variable, while `type` is a function defined in the code that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)` is a more verbose way of writing `type(obj)`, and it would return the same result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1) + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the object followed by an 's', which would result in incorrect pluralization for some words.

DONE.
