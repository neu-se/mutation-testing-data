  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` expects a callback function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the current element should be included in the filtered array, whereas `forEach` expects a callback function that does not have a return value and is used solely for side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` expects a callback function that returns a new value based on the current element, whereas `forEach` expects a callback function that does not have a return value and is used solely for side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` expects a callback function that returns a new accumulated value based on the current element and the previous accumulated value, whereas `forEach` expects a callback function that does not have a return value and is used solely for side effects.

DONE.
