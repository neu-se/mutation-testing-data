  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `x`, which could cause the `atan2` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `x` would be increased by 1, which could cause the `atan2` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `x` would be doubled, which could cause the `atan2` function to return a different result.

DONE.
