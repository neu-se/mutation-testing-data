  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.spread` method to be rejected, even if `x` and `y` are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.spread` method to be resolved, even if `x` and `y` are not the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.delay(1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.spread` method to be delayed by one second, which may cause it to time out or fail in some cases.

DONE.
