  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on a different object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(message, newPromise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with the arguments in a different order, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, [message]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with a single argument, which is a list containing the original `message`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
