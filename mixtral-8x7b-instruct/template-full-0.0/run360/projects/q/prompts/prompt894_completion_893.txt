 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the standard way to get the slice function in modern JavaScript, while `array_slice` is an implementation-specific name that may not be present in all environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is the standard way to access the slice function as a method of the Array prototype, while `array_slice` is an implementation-specific name that may not be present in all environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return [].slice }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a function that returns the slice function, rather than the slice function itself. This would cause the `nfapply` and `nfcall` methods to fail, as they expect a function that can be called with a variable number of arguments.
