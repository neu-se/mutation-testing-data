  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude) - deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `deg2rad` function on the `longitude` property of `point2` instead of `point1`. This could potentially cause a bug if the `longitude` values of the two points are not equal, as it would result in a different angle being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude) + deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds the `longitude` values of `point2` and `point1` instead of subtracting them. This could potentially cause a bug if the `longitude` values of the two points are not equal, as it would result in a different angle being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2
