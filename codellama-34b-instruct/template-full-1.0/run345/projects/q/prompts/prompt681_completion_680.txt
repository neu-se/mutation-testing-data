  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is now called with a different set of arguments, which can cause it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1) || []]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used to ensure that the `array_slice` method is only called if the `arguments` object is not empty. If the `arguments` object is empty, an empty array will be returned instead of the result of the `array_slice` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is now called with a different set of arguments, which can
