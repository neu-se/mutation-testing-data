  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because "\r" is a carriage return character, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a carriage return character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because "\t" is a tab character, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a tab character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because " " is a space character, which would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a space character instead of a newline character.

DONE.
