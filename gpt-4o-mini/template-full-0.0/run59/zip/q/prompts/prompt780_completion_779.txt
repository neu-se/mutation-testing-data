Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return promise.then(noop); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the result of the promise and always returns `undefined`, which means the state of the promise will not be captured correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return promise.reject(new Error("Forced rejection")); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to reject with a specific error, regardless of its actual state, leading to incorrect state reporting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return promise.inspect().state; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns only the state of the promise instead of the entire inspection result, which may lead to loss of important information about the promise's value or reason for rejection.

DONE.
