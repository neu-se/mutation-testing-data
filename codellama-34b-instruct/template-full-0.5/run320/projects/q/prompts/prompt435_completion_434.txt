  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is an object, and `null` is a primitive value, so the type of `process` will never be equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the type of `process.emit` will never be equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `typeof` will return the type of the value, which is `"function"`, not `"undefined"`.

DONE.
