  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple variable reference, while `x + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple variable reference, while `y` is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple variable reference, while `x * 2` is an expression that multiplies the value of `x` by 2.

DONE.
