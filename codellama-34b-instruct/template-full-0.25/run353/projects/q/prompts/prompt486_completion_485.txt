  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called twice, which would reset the unhandled rejections array twice, potentially causing issues with tracking unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the length of the unhandled rejections array to 0, without calling the `resetUnhandledRejections` function, which could cause issues with tracking unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable tracking unhandled rejections, potentially causing issues with detecting and handling unhandled rejections.

DONE.
