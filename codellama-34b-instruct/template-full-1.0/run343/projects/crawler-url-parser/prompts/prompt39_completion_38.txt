  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the protocol is not "http:" or "https:", while this new code fragment always returns the protocol, regardless of its value. This would likely cause the function to return a URL with an unexpected protocol, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the protocol is not "http:" or "https:", while this new code fragment always returns the host, regardless of its value. This would likely cause the function to return a URL with an unexpected host, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the protocol is not "http:" or "https:", while this new code fragment always returns the path, regardless of its value. This would likely cause the function to
