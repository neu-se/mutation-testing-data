  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is called on the `data` object, which is a string, and the regular expression `/^/` matches the start of the string. The replacement string `'http://'` is then prepended to the original string, which would change the URL.

DONE.
