  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `onAbort` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || onAbort
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `onAbort` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? onAbort : null
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `onAbort` as the second argument when `abort` is truthy, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
