  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `isGlob` variable, causing the code to enter the `else` block when the `src` is a glob, and the `if` block when it is not. This would likely cause unexpected behavior in the `zip` and `tar` methods, as they would be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('.').length == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `src` string contains only one dot, which is not the same as checking if it is a glob pattern. This would cause the code to enter the `if` block when it should enter the `else` block, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.existsSync(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `src` file exists, which is not the same as checking
