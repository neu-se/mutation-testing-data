  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is now starting from the third element instead of the second, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method is now being used to concatenate the elements of the array, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map((x) => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is now being used to convert the elements of the array to uppercase, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

DONE.
