  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is not a valid method on a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is not a valid method on a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is not a valid method on a promise object.

DONE.
