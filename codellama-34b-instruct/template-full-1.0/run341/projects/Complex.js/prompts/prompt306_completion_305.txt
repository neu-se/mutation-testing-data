  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b ** 2` is not equal to `b` when `b` is a non-integer number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * b` is not equal to `b` when `b` is a non-integer multiple of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is not equal to `b` when `b` is a positive integer.

DONE.
