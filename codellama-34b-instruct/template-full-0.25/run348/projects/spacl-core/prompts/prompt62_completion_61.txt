  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, whereas `reverse` is a property that returns the reversed order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sort()` is a method that sorts the elements of an array in place, whereas `reverse` is a property that returns the reversed order of the elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the original array.

DONE.
