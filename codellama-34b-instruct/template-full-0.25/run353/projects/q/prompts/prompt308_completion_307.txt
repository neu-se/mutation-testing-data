  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of `x`, rather than the value returned by the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value of `x`, rather than the value returned by the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with the message `x`, rather than returning a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the outcome of the `then` method.

DONE.
