  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would wait for all promises to be settled, while the modified code would return a rejected promise if there are any rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would wait for all promises to be settled, while the modified code would return a fulfilled promise if there are any fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would wait for all promises to be settled, while the modified code would return a fulfilled promise if there are any fulfilled promises.

DONE.
