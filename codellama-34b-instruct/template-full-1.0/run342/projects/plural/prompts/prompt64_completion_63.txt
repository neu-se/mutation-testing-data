  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bacterium` rule is different from the `bacteria` rule and would not match the input "bacterium."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `bacterium` rule and would cause the `plural` function to return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid value for the `bacterium` rule and would cause the `plural` function to return an error.

DONE.
