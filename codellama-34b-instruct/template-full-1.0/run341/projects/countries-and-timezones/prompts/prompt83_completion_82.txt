  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a function to be returned, but the new code returns a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => Function.prototype.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a function to be returned, but the new code returns a bound function with a null context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { getCountry() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a function to be returned, but the new code returns a function that calls the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
