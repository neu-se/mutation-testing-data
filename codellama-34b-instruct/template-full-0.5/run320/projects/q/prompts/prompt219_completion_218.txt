  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value` if it is not a promise, whereas the new code fragment returns `null` regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value` if it is not a promise, whereas the new code fragment returns `undefined` regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid argument")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value` if it is not a promise, whereas the new code fragment throws an error if `value` is not a promise.

DONE.
