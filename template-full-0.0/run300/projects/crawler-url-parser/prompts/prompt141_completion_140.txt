  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code uses a backslash. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code uses a space. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code uses a hash symbol. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
