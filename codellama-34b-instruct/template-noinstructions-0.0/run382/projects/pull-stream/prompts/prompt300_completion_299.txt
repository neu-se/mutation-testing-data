  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if both `ended` and `!end` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if either `ended` or `!end` are truthy.

DONE.
