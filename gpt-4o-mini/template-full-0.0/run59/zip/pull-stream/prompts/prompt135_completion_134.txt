Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback invocation to pass `null` as the first argument, indicating no error, while still passing the original error as the second argument, which could lead to confusion in error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the arguments, passing the error as the first argument and `null` as the second, which is contrary to the conventional Node.js callback pattern where the first argument is reserved for errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `abort` function with the error instead of invoking the callback, which would terminate the operation instead of signaling completion, potentially leading to unhandled errors.

DONE.
