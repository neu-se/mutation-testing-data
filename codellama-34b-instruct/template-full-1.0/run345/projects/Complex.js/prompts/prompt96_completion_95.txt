  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have the parentheses in the function call, which are required to execute the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NAN'] = Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `Complex['INFINITY']` to `Complex['NAN']`, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.sign = function() {
  var abs = this['abs']();
  return new Complex(
    this['re'] / abs,
    this['im'] / abs);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original `sign` function with a new function that has a different implementation.

DONE.
