  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array would be checked for the `reason` object, rather than the `unhandledRejections` array, which could cause the test to pass even if the `reason` object is not in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be checked for the `promise` object, rather than the `unhandledRejections` array, which could cause the test to pass even if the `promise` object is not in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array would be checked for a length
