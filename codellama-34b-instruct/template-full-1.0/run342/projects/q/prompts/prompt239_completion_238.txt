  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would always return the number 2, regardless of the value of `resolvedPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would return the opposite of the value of `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would return 0 if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, regardless of its actual value.

DONE.
