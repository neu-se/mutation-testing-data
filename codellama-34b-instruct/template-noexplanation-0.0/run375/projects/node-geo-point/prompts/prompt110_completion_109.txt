  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This will change the behavior of the code by using the logarithm to the base 10 instead of the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This will change the behavior of the code by using the square root function instead of the logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This will change the behavior of the code by using the absolute value function instead of the logarithm.

DONE.
