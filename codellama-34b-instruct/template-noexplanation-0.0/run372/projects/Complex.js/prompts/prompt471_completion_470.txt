  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This change will cause the `valueOf` method to return `null` when the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to zero, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 1
```
This change will cause the `valueOf` method to return `null` when the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to one, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === this['re']
```
This change will cause the `valueOf` method to return `null` when the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to the real part, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
