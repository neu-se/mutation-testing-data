  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be off by one, potentially leading to errors in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be double the original value, potentially leading to errors in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` would cause the result to be half the original value, potentially leading to errors in the calculation.

DONE.
