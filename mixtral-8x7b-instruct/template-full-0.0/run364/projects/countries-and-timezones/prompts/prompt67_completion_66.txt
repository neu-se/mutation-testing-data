 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would now return the `options.country` instead of the actual country object. This could cause issues if the `options.country` is `undefined` or a different object than the expected country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now tries to access a non-existent property in the `countries` object. This would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return `undefined` instead of the actual country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries[id]
