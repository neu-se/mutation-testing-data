  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to `runSingle`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to `runSingle`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"foo"` would be passed as the third argument to `runSingle`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
