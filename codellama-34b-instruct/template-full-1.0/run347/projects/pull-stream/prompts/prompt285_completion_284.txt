  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the inverse of the original `cb` value, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
