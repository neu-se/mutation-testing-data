  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first character of the `src` string, potentially producing a different result when making a comparison to the actual folder path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.concat("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the end of the `src` string, potentially producing a different result when making a comparison to the actual folder path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.join(path.dirname(tarFilePath), src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the `src` string differently with the path of the target folder, potentially producing a different result when making a comparison to the actual folder path.

DONE.
