  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the file name and line number portion of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first part of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first word of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

DONE.
