  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would not be called when an error is thrown, which could cause the error to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called with a different error message, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would log a message to the console instead of throwing an error, which could cause the test to pass unexpectedly.

DONE.
