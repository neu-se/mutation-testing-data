  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of `a`, while the modified code calculates the cosine of `a + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of `a`, while the modified code calculates the cosine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of `a`, while the modified code calculates the cosine of `a - b`.

DONE.
