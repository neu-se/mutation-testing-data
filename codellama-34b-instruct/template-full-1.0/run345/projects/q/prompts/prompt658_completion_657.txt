  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```0```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, rather than an array of function arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<Promise>.reject()````
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected, rather than resolved with the function arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```null```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing a single `null` value, rather than an array of function arguments.

DONE.
