  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.otherMethod()
```
This would result in a different method being called, potentially modifying the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in an error being thrown when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method, potentially causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){ return false; }
```
This would result in the `promiseDispatch` method always returning a false value, potentially causing the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
