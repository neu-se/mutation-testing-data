  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `undefined` in this case. This would cause the `all` method to resolve with an array of `undefined` values, instead of the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){return null})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `null` in this case. This would cause the `all` method to resolve with an array of `null` values, instead of the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){throw new Error()})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the
