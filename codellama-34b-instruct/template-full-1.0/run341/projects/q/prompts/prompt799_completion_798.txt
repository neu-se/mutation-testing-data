  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `then` would ignore the value returned by the promise and return `undefined` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `then` would ignore the value returned by the promise and return `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `0` to `then` would ignore the value returned by the promise and return `0` instead.

DONE.
