Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to treat an empty array as a valid input, whereas the original code checks if the input is not an array at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow non-array objects (like plain objects) to pass through, while the original code specifically checks for arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `instanceof` operator incorrectly, which would always return `false` for non-array objects, thus failing to properly validate if `array` is indeed an array.

DONE.
