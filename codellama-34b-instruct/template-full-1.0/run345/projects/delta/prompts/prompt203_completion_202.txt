  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new instance of the Delta class, rather than returning a new Delta instance with the concatenated operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.concat(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would recursively call the concat method, potentially causing a stack overflow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.concat(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the other Delta instance with the current instance, rather than the current instance with the other instance.

DONE.
