  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI component, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URI.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` only encodes the URI component, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes the entire URI.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the decoded basename to lowercase, whereas the original code fragment does not perform any case conversion.

DONE.
