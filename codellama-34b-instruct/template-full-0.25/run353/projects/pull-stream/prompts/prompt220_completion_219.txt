  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
