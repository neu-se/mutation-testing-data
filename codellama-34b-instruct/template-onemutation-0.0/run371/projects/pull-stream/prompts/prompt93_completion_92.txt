  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the data as the second argument, while this new code fragment calls the callback with null as the first argument and data as the second argument. This change would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this new behavior.
