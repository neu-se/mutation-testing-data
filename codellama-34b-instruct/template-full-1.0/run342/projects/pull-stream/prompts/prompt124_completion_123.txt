  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "error" instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `end` parameter instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the incremented value of `i` instead of the expected result.

DONE.
