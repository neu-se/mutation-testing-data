  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with `null` as the first argument, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with `ended` as the first argument, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is called with `null` as both arguments, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
