  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a promise for the result value, rather than the result value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a promise for the result value, rather than the result value itself, and would also add an unnecessary then() call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
}, function (error) {
    return error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a promise for the result value, rather than the result value itself, and would also add an unnecessary then() call with a rejection handler that simply returns the error.

DONE.
