  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is different. In the original code, `index - offset` is evaluated first, and then the result is subtracted from `length`. In the modified code, `length - index` is evaluated first, and then the result is added to `offset`. This could potentially result in a different final value, depending on the values of `length`, `index`, and `offset`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is different. In the original code, `index - offset` is evaluated first, and then the result is subtracted from `length`. In the modified code, `length + offset` is evaluated first, and then the result is subtracted from `index`. This could potentially result in a different final value, depending on the values of `length`, `index`, and `offset`.
