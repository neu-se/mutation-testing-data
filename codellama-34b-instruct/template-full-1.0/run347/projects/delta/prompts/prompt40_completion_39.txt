  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable properties. This means that if a property is an object or an array, it would not be returned as expected in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs. This would cause the `reduce` function to receive a different set of arguments, resulting in potentially different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.constructor` returns the constructor function that created the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable properties.
