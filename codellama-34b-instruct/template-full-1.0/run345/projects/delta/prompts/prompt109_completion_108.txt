  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reversePredicate = (op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new predicate will return the opposite value of the original predicate for the same inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
alternativePredicate = (op, index) => predicate(op, index) && op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the new predicate will only return true if the original predicate is also true and the `retain` property of the op is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
peekPredicate = (op, index) => predicate(op, index) && this.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new predicate will only return true if the original predicate is also true and the `peekType()` method of the delta returns the string 'insert'.

DONE.
