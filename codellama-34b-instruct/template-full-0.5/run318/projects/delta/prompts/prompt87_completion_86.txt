  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last operation to the new operation, instead of merging them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, lastOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the attributes of the last operation, instead of modifying the existing object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes.slice();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the attributes object, instead of modifying the existing object.

DONE.
