  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is neither infinite nor NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a.im
```
This would result in different behavior because this expression would be equivalent to `a.im` negated, which would return a different value for complex numbers with negative imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because this expression would return the absolute value of `a.im`, which would give a different result for complex numbers with negative imaginary parts.

DONE.
