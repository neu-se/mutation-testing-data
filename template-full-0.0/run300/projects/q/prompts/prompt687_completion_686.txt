  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which could potentially change the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `array_slice` would be different, which could potentially change the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[], 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `array_slice` would be an empty array, which would result in a different resulting array.

DONE.
