  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of the latitude, while `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians. Using `sinφ1` instead of `deg2rad` would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of the latitude, while `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians. Using `cosφ1` instead of `deg2rad` would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, while `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians. Using `Math.PI
