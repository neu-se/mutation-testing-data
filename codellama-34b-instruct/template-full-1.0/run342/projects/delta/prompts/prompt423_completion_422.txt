  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the comparison between `length` and `index - offset` in the while loop condition, while the modified code checks the comparison between `length` and `index + offset`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the comparison between `length` and `index - offset` in the while loop condition, while the modified code checks the comparison between `length` and `offset - index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * (index - offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the comparison between `length` and `index - offset` in the while loop condition, while the modified code checks the comparison between `length` and the result of multiplying `index - offset` by `length`.

DONE.
