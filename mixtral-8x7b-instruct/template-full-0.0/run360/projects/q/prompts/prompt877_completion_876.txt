 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `[].slice.call` instead of `array_slice`, which might not support all environments and could cause compatibility issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.prototype.slice` instead of `array_slice`, which might not be available in older browsers and could cause compatibility issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `[].concat.apply` instead of `array_slice`, which is less efficient and could cause performance issues in some cases.

DONE.
