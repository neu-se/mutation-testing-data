  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, so it would return `false` if `abort` is not a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for both value and type inequality, so it would return `false` if `abort` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because if `abort` is truthy (e.g., a non-zero number), the resulting expression would be `false` and the `if` block would not be executed.

DONE.
