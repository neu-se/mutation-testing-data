  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 0);
```
This code fragment uses `setTimeout` instead of `setImmediate` to schedule the callback to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds. This can help to simulate a situation where the callback is not called immediately, which can help to test the robustness of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This code fragment uses `process.nextTick` instead of `setImmediate` to schedule the callback to be called after the current event loop iteration. This can help to simulate a situation where the callback is not called immediately, which can help to test the robustness of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 100
