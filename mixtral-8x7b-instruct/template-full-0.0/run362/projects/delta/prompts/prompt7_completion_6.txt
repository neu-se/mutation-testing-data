 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `a` object instead of the `b` object for reducing the keys, potentially including null values in the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider keys present in the `b` object, ignoring keys present in the `a` object that are not present in the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the keys from the `b` object, but without deep cloning, potentially modifying the original `b` object.

DONE.
