  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.length === src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality of the two strings, while this new code fragment checks for equality of the lengths of the two strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment checks if `targetBasePath` includes `src` as a substring.

DONE.
