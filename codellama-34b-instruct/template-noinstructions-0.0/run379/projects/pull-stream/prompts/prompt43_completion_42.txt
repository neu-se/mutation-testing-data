  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `ref` array, whereas `ref` itself is a reference to the original array. This means that any changes made to the `ref` array would not be reflected in the shallow copy created by `ref.slice()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.concat()` creates a new array that is the result of concatenating the `ref` array with the `arguments` array. This means that any changes made to the `ref` array would not be reflected in the new array created by `ref.concat()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.map(function(x) { return x })
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.map()` creates a new array that is the result of applying the provided function to each element of the `ref` array.
