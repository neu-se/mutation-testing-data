 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://not-a-real-url'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the parsedBaseUrl object with a string, causing errors in subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the parsedBaseUrl object with an empty object, causing errors in subsequent operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `URL.parse` function instead of the `URL.format` function, causing the `ret.baseurl` property to contain an object instead of a formatted URL string.

DONE.
