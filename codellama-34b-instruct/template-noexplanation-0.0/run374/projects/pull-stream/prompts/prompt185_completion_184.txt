  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `false` instead of `true`, which will result in the `abortCb` function being called with `abort` set to `false`, even if the `abort` parameter is set to `true`. This will cause the `abortCb` function to return `cb(null, array[i++])` instead of `cb(abort, cb)`, which will result in the `values` function returning a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` instead of `true`, which will result in the `abortCb` function being called with `abort` set to `null`, even if the `abort` parameter is set to `true`. This will cause the `abortCb` function to return `cb(null, array[i++])` instead of `cb(abort, cb)`, which
