Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `props` array to be populated with an empty string instead of the intended substring, potentially leading to incorrect path matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add `2` to the `props` array, which is not the intended behavior of extracting the substring from the matched part, leading to incorrect captures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the length of the `part` string into the `props` array instead of the intended substring, which would not correctly represent the path captures.

DONE.
