  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the keys of the object, while the `values` method returns an array of the values of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the keys of the object, while the `length` property returns the number of elements in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the keys of the object, while the `toString` method returns a string representation of the object.

DONE.
