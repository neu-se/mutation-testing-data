  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `a`, which is the real part of the complex number. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part, leading to different behavior in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
