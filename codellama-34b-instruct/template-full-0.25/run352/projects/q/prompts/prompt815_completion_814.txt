  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `throw reason;`, which would throw the rejection reason as an exception, whereas the new code fragment would return a rejected promise with the rejection reason as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `throw reason;`, which would throw the rejection reason as an exception, whereas the new code fragment would return a rejected promise with the rejection reason as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `throw reason;`, which would throw the rejection reason as an exception, whereas the new code fragment would return a resolved promise with the rejection reason as the value.

DONE.
