  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is now extracting three characters instead of two, which would result in a different replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ii' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string now contains two 'i' characters instead of one, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(
