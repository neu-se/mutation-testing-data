  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `dstOffset` value would cause the `dstOffsetStr` property to be one hour ahead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `dstOffset` value would cause the `dstOffsetStr` property to be one hour behind the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the `dstOffset` value would cause the `dstOffsetStr` property to be twice the original value.

DONE.
