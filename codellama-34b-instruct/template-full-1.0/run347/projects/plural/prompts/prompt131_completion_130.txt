  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].matches(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `matches` is not a function in JavaScript, and would cause a syntax error when trying to execute the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.match` would not be the same as `rule[0].test(word)`, as it would return an array of matches instead of a boolean value indicating whether the regex pattern matches the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof word === rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof word` would always return a string, regardless of whether the word matches the regex pattern or not, and `rule[0]` is a regex pattern.

DONE.
