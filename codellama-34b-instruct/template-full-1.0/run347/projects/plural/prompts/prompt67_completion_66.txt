  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'meme'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'meme' is not a valid word for pluralization, and would result in the original code returning 'memoes' instead of 'memos'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoize'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'memoize' is not a valid word for pluralization, and would result in the original code returning 'memoizes' instead of 'memos'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoize'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'memoize' is not a valid word for pluralization, and would result in the original code returning 'memoizes' instead of 'memos'.

DONE.
