  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to normalize the longitude value to the range -180 to 180, while the new code fragment would not perform this normalization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to normalize the longitude value to the range -180 to 180, while the new code fragment would normalize the value to the range 0 to 360.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to normalize the longitude value to the range -180 to 180, while the new code fragment would normalize the value to the range -180 to 0.
