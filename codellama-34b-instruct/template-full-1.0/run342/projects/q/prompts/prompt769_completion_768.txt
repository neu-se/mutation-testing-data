  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anyResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `anyResolved` is a different function from `allResolved`, and it may not return the same promise value as `allResolved`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different function from `allResolved`, and it may not return the same promise value as `allResolved`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noneResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `noneResolved` is a non-existent function, and it would cause a reference error.

DONE.
