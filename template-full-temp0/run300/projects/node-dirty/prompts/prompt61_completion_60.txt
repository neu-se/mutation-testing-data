  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `destroy` method to be called with an error, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `destroy` method to be called with a null error, which would not trigger the `error` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'), true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `destroy` method to be called with an error and the `force` option set to true, which would force the stream to be destroyed immediately, regardless of whether there are any pending writes.

DONE.
