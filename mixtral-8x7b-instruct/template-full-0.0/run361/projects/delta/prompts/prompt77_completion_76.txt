 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
lastOp !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `lastOp` to be a non-object primitive, which would bypass the conditional check and potentially cause a runtime error when trying to access properties of `lastOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
lastOp.constructor.name === 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if `lastOp` is an instance of the built-in `Object` constructor, rather than checking if it is an object (which includes arrays and other exotic objects). This could lead to unexpected behavior when `lastOp` is an array or another exotic object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `lastOp` is an array, which is a type of object. If `lastOp` is an array, the conditional block would be
