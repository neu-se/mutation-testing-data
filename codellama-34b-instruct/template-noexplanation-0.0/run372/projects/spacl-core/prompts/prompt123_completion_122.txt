  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This code fragment is a method call on the `regex` property, which is a `Matcher` object. The `test()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the `path` argument matches the regular expression pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.exec(path)
```
This code fragment is a method call on the `regex` property, which is a `Matcher` object. The `exec()` method returns an array of strings representing the matches found in the `path` argument, or `null` if no matches are found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.match(path)
```
This code fragment is a method call on the `regex` property, which is a `Matcher` object. The `match()` method returns an array of strings representing the matches found in the `path` argument, or `null` if no matches are found.

DONE.
