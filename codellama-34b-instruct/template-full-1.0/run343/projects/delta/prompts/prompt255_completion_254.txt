  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted code would increment the value of `opLength`, potentially causing the code to skip over a crucial operation or to perform an operation on the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted code would decrement the value of `opLength`, potentially causing the code to skip over a crucial operation or to perform an operation on the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted code would double the value of `opLength`, potentially causing the code to perform an operation on the wrong value or to perform an operation too many times.

DONE.
