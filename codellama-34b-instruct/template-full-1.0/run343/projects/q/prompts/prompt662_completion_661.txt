  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `arguments[2]`. This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function, while `array_slice` creates a new array containing a subset of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `arguments[0]`. This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` is the first argument passed to the function, while `array_slice` creates a new array containing a subset of the original array, starting from the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `args`. This would result in different behavior because `args` is a variable that stores the arguments passed to the function, while `array_slice` creates a new array containing a subset of the original array.

DONE.
