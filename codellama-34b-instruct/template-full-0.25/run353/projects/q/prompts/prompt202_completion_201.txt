  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the second line of the stack trace instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[lines.length - 1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the last line of the stack trace instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[Math.floor(Math.random() * lines.length)].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check a random line of the stack trace instead of the first.

DONE.
