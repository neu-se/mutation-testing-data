  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer([])` creates a new deferred object with an empty arguments list, whereas `defer` in the original code fragment refers to the `defer` function that creates a new deferred object with a copy of the current arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` creates a new deferred object with a `null` argument, whereas `defer` in the original code fragment refers to the `defer` function that creates a new deferred object with a copy of the current arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` creates a new deferred object with an empty arguments list, whereas `defer` in the original code fragment refers to the `defer` function that creates a new deferred object with a copy of
