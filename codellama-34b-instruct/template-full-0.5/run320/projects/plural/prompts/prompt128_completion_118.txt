  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the code to fail silently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 < rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the array, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
