  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sin(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the sine function has been changed, causing the imaginary part of the result to be negated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument of the sine function has been doubled, causing the imaginary part of the result to be multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(b) * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because a factor of PI has been introduced into the argument of the sine function, causing the imaginary part of the result to be scaled by PI.

DONE.
