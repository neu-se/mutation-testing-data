  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== 'i' && c !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the letter 'i' or 'I', while this code checks for their absence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the letter 'i' or 'I', while this code checks for the presence of the letter 'j' or 'J'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'k' || c === 'K'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the letter 'i' or 'I', while this code checks for the presence of the letter 'k' or 'K'.

DONE.
