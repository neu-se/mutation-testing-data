  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, acc` returns both the error and the accumulated value, while `err` only returns the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, acc` returns both the error and the accumulated value, while `acc` only returns the accumulated value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, acc` returns both the error and the accumulated value, while `null` only returns null.

DONE.
