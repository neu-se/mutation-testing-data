  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when the current operation is an insert operation, whereas the original code fragment would be true when the current operation is not an insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when the current operation is not a delete operation, whereas the original code fragment would be true when the current operation is not an insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when the current operation is a retain operation, whereas the original code fragment would be true when the current operation is not an insert operation.

DONE.
