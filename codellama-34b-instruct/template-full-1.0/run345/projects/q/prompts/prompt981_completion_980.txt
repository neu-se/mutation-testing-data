  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` returns a function that takes a single argument, while `bind` returns a function that takes no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred.makeNodeResolver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would have a different `this` value.

DONE.
