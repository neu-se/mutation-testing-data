  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element in the array would not be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < len + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would access an index that is out of bounds, causing an error.

DONE.
