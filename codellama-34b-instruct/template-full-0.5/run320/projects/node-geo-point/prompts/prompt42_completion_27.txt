  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the latitude of the second point, which is not the same as the sine of the difference in latitude between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the latitude of the second point, which is not the same as the sine of the difference in latitude between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad - point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the difference in latitude between the two points, which is not the same as the sine of the latitude of the second point.

DONE.
