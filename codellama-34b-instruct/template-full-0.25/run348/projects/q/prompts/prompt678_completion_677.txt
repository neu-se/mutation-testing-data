  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "apply" method on the object, rather than the "post" method, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "post" method with a different set of arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "post" method with a different set of arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
