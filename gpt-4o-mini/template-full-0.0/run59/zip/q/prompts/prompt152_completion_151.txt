Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the property accessed from the stack trace of the error to the error message, which does not contain the stack trace information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `message` property of the `promise` object instead of the `stack` property, which would likely lead to undefined behavior since promises do not have a `message` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack + " Additional Info"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a string " Additional Info" to the stack trace, altering the original stack trace output and potentially confusing the debugging process.

DONE.
