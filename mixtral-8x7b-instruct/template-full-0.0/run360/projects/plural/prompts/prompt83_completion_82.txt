 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added for 'mouse' returns 'mice', but replacing it with the string 'mice' would bypass the function and directly return the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added for 'mouse' returns 'mice', but replacing it with 'mouses' would change the plural form of 'mouse' to 'mouses', which is not the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mou'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added for 'mouse' returns 'mice', but replacing it with 'mou' would return an incorrect plural form, and the code that checks for words ending in 'ou' and appends an 's' would not be triggered.

DONE.
