  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of any non-null object, while this mutation only checks for the presence of the NaN value specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain.includes('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of any non-null object, while this mutation only checks for the presence of the string "foo" specifically.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.retain % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of any non-null object, while this mutation only checks for the presence of an even number specifically.

DONE.
