  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes an argument, and passing `false` as an argument would cause the function to not execute the code inside it, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes an argument, and passing `null` as an argument would cause the function to execute the code inside it with a `null` value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes an argument, and passing `undefined` as an argument would cause the function to execute the code inside it with an `undefined` value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
