 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Q` instance is created, which may have different internal state and behavior than the original `Q` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the built-in `Promise.resolve` method instead of the custom `Q.resolve` method, which may have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with the raw `value` instead of wrapping it in a `Q` instance, which may have different behavior and affect how the promise is handled by other parts of the code.

DONE.
