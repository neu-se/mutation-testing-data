  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a global search and replace all occurrences of the pattern, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a case-insensitive search, so the pattern would match both lowercase and uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a multi-line search, so the pattern would match across multiple lines.

DONE.
