  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `nodeArgs` except the first one, whereas `nodeArgs` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([])` would return a new array containing all elements of `nodeArgs` followed by an empty array, whereas `nodeArgs` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` would return a new array containing all elements of `nodeArgs` that pass the filter function, whereas `nodeArgs` itself is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
