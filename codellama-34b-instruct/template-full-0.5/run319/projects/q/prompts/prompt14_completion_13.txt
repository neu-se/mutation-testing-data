  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is the opposite of `ses.ok`, so it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, and the code inside the `if` block would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.maybeOk` is a new property that does not exist in the original code, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.okay
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.okay` is a new property that does not exist in the original code, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
