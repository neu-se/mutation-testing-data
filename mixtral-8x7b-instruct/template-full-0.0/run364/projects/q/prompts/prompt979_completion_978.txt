 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the element to the beginning of the array, changing the order of the arguments passed to `dispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array, causing the `nodeArgs` array to not include the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs[nodeArgs.length] =
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to the last element of the array, instead of using the `push` method. This could potentially cause issues if the `length` property of the `nodeArgs` array is not updated correctly.

DONE.
