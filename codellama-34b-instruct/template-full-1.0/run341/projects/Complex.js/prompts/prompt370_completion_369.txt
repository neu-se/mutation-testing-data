  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `d` variable to be assigned the value `b` instead of the result of the expression `a / 0`, which would cause a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `d` variable to be assigned the value `a + 1` instead of the result of the expression `a / 0`, which would cause a division by zero error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `d` variable to be assigned the value `Math.sqrt(a*b)` instead of the result of the expression `a / 0`, which would cause a division by zero error.

DONE.
