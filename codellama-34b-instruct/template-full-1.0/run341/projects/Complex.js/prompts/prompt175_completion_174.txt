  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) > Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the less-than operator is replaced with a greater-than operator, which would change the result of the conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) == Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the less-than operator is replaced with an equality operator, which would change the result of the conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) + Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the less-than operator is replaced with an addition operator, which would change the result of the conditional statement.

DONE.
