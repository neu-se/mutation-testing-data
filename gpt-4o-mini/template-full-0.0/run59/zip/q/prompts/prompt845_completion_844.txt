Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1000, error
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the timeout duration to be 1000 milliseconds longer than the original, potentially allowing the promise to resolve after the original timeout period, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms * 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the timeout duration, which may cause the promise to wait longer than intended before rejecting, thus altering the expected timing of the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, error
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the timeout to zero milliseconds, which would cause the promise to immediately reject without waiting for any actual timeout period, leading to premature rejection.

DONE.
