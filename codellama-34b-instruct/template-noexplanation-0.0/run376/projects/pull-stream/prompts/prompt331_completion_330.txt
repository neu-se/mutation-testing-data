  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with two arguments, which is not the intended behavior. The `once` function is only supposed to be called with one argument, the `end` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with two arguments, but the second argument will always be `null`, which is not the intended behavior. The `once` function is only supposed to be called with one argument, the `end` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, undefined)
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with two arguments, but the second argument will always be `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior. The `once` function is only supposed to be called with one argument, the `end` argument.

DONE.
