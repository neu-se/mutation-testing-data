  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `undefined` instead of `null`, which may cause issues in the code that uses the `asyncMap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `null` instead of `data`, which may cause issues in the code that uses the `asyncMap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return the same value as the input, which may cause issues in the code that uses the `asyncMap` function.

DONE.
