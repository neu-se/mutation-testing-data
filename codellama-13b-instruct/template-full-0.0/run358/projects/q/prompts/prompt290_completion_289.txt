  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` function would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.promise` function would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be returned instead of resolved.

DONE.
