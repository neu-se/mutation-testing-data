  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This change will cause the function to always return the second element of the `rules` array, rather than the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i]
```
This change will cause the function to always return the `i`th element of the `rules` array, rather than the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i][0]
```
This change will cause the function to always return the first element of the `i`th element of the `rules` array, rather than the first element.

DONE.
