 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the input as an error, instead of checking if the error is equal to `true`. This is different from the original code, which checks if the error is equal to `true` before proceeding to the next stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the input as the end of the stream, instead of checking if the error is equal to `true`. This is different from the original code, which checks if the error is equal to `true` before proceeding to the next stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the value `42` to the `cb` function, instead of checking if the error is equal to `true`. This is different from the original code, which checks if the error is equal to `true` before proceeding
