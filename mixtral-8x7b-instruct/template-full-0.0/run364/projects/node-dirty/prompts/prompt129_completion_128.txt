 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method without a callback will prevent further writes to the stream until `uncork` is called, but the original code fragment uses the cork method with a callback to control when to write the next chunk of data. This change may cause the queue to not be processed properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always write an empty string to the stream, which may cause unexpected behavior in the queue processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.forEach((cbs, key) => {
  this._queue.delete(key);
  const data = `${JSON.stringify({key, val: this._data.get(key)})}\n`;
  ++this._inFlightWrites;
  this._waitFor
