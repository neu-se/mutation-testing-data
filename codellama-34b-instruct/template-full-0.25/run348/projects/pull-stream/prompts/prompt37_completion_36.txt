  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the new index may not exist, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the new index may not contain the expected value, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the new index may not contain the expected value, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
