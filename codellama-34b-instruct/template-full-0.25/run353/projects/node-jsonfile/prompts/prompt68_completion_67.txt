  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression global and replaces all occurrences of the BOM, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would also match the BOM if it appears in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/gm, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gm` flags are added, which makes the regular expression global and multiline, so it would also match the BOM if it appears on a different line.

DONE.
