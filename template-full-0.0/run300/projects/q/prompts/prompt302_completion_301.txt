  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict equality, while this replacement checks for loose equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement checks for greater than.

DONE.
