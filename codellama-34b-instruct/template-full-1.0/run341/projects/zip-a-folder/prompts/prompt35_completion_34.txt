  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe.end();
```
This would result in an error because the `end()` method is not a property of the `pipe` method, and it is not a function that can be called on the `zipArchive` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe.end(null, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it is modifying the `end()` method of the `pipe` method to take an extra parameter, which would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it is modifying the `push()` method of the `pipe` method to push a `null` value onto the stream, which would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
