  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would continue to iterate over the entire map, even if the callback function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key === val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would only iterate over the keys that are equal to the value passed to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would only iterate over the keys that have a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
