  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `array_reduce` is expected to take a function with two arguments, but the provided function only takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `array_reduce` is expected to take an array as its first argument, but the provided function is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `array_reduce` is expected to take a non-null object as its first argument, but the provided function is a null value.

DONE.
