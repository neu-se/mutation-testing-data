  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i < length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely and potentially cause a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i > length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run in reverse, starting from `length` and decrementing `i` until it reaches 0. This would cause the loop to run in reverse, which could potentially cause issues with the code that depends on the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than the original loop, which could potentially cause issues with the code that depends on the loop.

DONE.
