 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb => cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` might not be called if it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb => setTimeout(cb, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be executed asynchronously, which might not be expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` would not be called, which might cause issues if the callback is expected to do something.

DONE.
