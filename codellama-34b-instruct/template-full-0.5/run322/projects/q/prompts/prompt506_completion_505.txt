  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array instead of mutating the existing one, which could cause issues if the code relies on mutation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the array instead of mutating the existing one, which could cause issues if the code relies on mutation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an empty array instead of using the existing one, which could cause issues if the code relies on the original array.

DONE.
