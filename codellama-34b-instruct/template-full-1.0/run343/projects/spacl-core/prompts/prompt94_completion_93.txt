  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name + '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a trailing period to the policy name, which may not match any policy in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the policy name to lowercase, which may not match any policy in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name + 'xyz'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'xyz' to the policy name, which may not match any policy in the map.

DONE.
