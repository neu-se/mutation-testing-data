  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(/([^/]+)/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it match all occurrences in the string instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(/([^/]+)/i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(/([^/]+)/y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `y` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it sticky, meaning it will only match at the end of the previous match.

DONE.
