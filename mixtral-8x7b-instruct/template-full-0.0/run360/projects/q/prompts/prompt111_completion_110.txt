 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
collect.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the element at the beginning of the array, not the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
collect.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array by removing (or replacing) existing elements and/or adding new elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1) that can be used for generating random values. It would not have the same effect as pushing a value into the `collect` array.

DONE.
