  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```ops.reverse()```
This would result in different behavior because the ops array would be reversed, causing the operations to be applied in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```const ops = [];```
This would result in different behavior because the ops array would be empty, causing no operations to be applied at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```const ops = [...ops];```
This would result in different behavior because the ops array would be a shallow copy of the original array, meaning that any changes made to the copy would not affect the original.

DONE.
