  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attributes` is not null and has a length greater than 0, while this replacement checks if `attributes` is not null and has a length equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attributes` is not null and has a length greater than 0, while this replacement checks if `attributes` is not null and has a length greater than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the
