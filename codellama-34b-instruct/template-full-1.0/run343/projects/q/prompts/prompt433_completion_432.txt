  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=== false` check would always return `false` regardless of the value of `trackUnhandledRejections`, causing the `untrackRejection` method to be called every time a rejection is handled, regardless of whether it should be tracked or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method would return `-1` if the `promise
