  Option 1: The `end` variable can be replaced with a different variable:
```
return cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of `cb()` instead of the value of the `end` variable.

Option 2: The `end` variable can be replaced with a different logical operator:
```
return cb(end || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of the value of the `end` variable if `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The `end` variable can be replaced with a different comparison operator:
```
return cb(end === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` only if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, instead of any truthy value.

DONE.
