 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the longitude of the first point for the `a` calculation, regardless of the second point's longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the current object (`this`) instead of the second point's longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the `a` calculation, leading to unpredictable results.

DONE.
