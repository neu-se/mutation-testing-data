  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method returns a promise inspection object, and the `state` property of that object is either "fulfilled" or "rejected", not "pending".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method returns a promise inspection object, and the `state` property of that object is either "fulfilled" or "rejected", not "pending".

DONE.
