  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `newOp` to be pushed onto the `delta.ops` array, which would cause the `compose` method to return a delta with an extra operation at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `newOp` to be pushed onto the `delta.ops` array, which would cause the `compose` method to return a delta with an extra operation at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `newOp` to be pushed onto the `delta.ops` array, which would cause the `compose` method to return a delta with an extra operation at the end.

DONE.
