  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` property is not null, but this change would check if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` property is not null, but this change would check if the `attributes` property is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.some(attr => attr.value === 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` property is not null, but this change would check if the `attributes` property has a specific value.

DONE.
