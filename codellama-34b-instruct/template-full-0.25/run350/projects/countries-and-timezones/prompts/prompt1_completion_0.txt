  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a string, and `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In the original code, `!name` would evaluate to `true` if `name` is an empty string, but `name === undefined` would only evaluate to `true` if `name` is actually `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.length` would return the length of the string `name`, while `name === undefined` would only evaluate to `true` if `name` is actually `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof name === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof name` would return the type of `name`, which would be `'string'` if `name` is a string, while `typeof name === 'undefined'` would only evaluate to `true
