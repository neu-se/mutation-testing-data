 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be bound to the process domain, and unhandled errors might not be handled properly in a domain-enabled environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be bound to the process domain, and unhandled errors might not be handled properly in a domain-enabled environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be bound to the process domain, and unhandled errors might not be handled properly in a domain-enabled environment.

DONE.
