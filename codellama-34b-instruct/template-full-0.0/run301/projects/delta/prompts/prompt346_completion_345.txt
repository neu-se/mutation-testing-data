  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding the length of the opData object to the index, while the modified code fragment is adding 1 to the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding the length of the opData object to the index, while the modified code fragment is subtracting 1 from the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding the length of the opData object to the index, while the modified code fragment is multiplying the index by 2.

DONE.
