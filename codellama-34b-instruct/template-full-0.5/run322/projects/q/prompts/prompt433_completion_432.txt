  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both equality and type, whereas the `!` operator only checks for equality. In this case, if `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean value, the `===` operator would check if it is equal to `false`, while the `!` operator would check if it is truthy or falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality and type, whereas the `!` operator only checks for inequality. In this case, if `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean value, the `!==` operator would check if it is not equal to `false`, while the `!` operator would check if it is truthy or falsy.
