  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the `cosh` function to produce different results, which could potentially cause errors in the calculation of the complex arcus cosecans.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `b`. This change would cause the `acos` function to produce different results, which could potentially cause errors in the calculation of the complex arcus cosecans.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` and `b` are variables, while `a * b`
