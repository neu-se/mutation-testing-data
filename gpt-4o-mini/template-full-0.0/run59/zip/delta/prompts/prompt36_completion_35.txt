Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to only allow the overwrite if `priority` is explicitly `true`, which is the opposite of the original logic that allows overwriting when `priority` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the overwrite when `priority` is anything other than `false`, including `true` or `undefined`, which would not match the original intent of only allowing overwriting when `priority` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority && priority !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional check that would prevent overwriting if `priority` is `undefined`, which is not considered in the original logic, thus potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
