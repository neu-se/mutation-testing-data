  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter` iterator would be used instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which could cause the `compose` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next operation in the iterator, but does not advance the iterator. This could cause the `compose` method to behave differently if the next operation is not the same as the one returned by `thisIter.next()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next operation in the iterator, but does not advance the iterator. This could cause the `compose` method to behave differently if the next operation is not the same as the one returned by `otherIter.next()`.

DONE.
