  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is called with the result of `promiseDispatch`, which is a promise, whereas `resolve` is called with the result of `_fulfilled` or `_rejected`, which is a value or a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called with the result of `promiseDispatch`, which is a promise, whereas `reject` is called with the result of `_rejected`, which is a value or a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is called with the result of `promiseDispatch`, which is a promise, whereas `notify` is called with the result of `_progressed`, which is a value or a
