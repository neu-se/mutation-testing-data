  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message than the original code, which would cause the tests to fail if they are checking for the specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately, without making any request, which would cause the tests to fail if they are expecting a request to be made.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the same error message as the original code, which would not cause any test failures.

DONE.
