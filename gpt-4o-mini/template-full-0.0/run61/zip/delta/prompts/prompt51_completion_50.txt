Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the first value of the object `b` instead of the first key, which could lead to mismatched comparisons and potentially throw an error even when the objects have the same structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the length of the keys of object `b` to `embedType`, which is a string, leading to a type mismatch and causing the error message to be misleading.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares `embedType` to itself instead of the first key of object `b`, which will always be true if `embedType` is defined, thus bypassing the intended error check.

DONE.
