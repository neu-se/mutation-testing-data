  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` returns the path of the current module file, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current module's parent directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(__dirname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(__dirname)` returns the path of the current module's parent directory, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current module file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(__dirname, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join(__dirname, '..')` returns the path of the current module's parent directory, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current module file.

DONE.
