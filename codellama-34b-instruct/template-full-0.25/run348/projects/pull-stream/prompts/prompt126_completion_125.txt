  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator is different from the original `>` operator, which would cause the function to return a different value when `i` is equal to `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is different from the original `>` operator, which would cause the function to return a different value when `i` is less than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator is different from the original `>` operator, which would cause the function to return a different value when `i` is equal to `max`.

DONE.
