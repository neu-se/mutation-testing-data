 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places === undefined ? 0 : places
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for `undefined` instead of using the loose equality `||`. This could cause issues if a custom `places` object with a falsey value is passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the missing `places` value with `null` instead of `0`. This could cause unexpected behavior in the multiplication and division operations within the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the missing `places` value with `1` instead of `0`. This would cause the methods to behave differently, as the precision of the calculations would be affected.

DONE.
