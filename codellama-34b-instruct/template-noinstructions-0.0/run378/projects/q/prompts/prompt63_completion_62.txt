  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so calling `setImmediate` with `null` as the first argument would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so calling `setImmediate` with `undefined` as the first argument would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a function, so calling `setImmediate` with `0` as the first argument would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
