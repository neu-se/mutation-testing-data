  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr == null` would also match null values, whereas `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` only matches undefined values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr !== null` would also match non-null values, whereas `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` only matches undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof currentUrlStr !== null` would also match non-null values, whereas `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` only matches undefined values.

DONE.
