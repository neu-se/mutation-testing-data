  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making the code block execute when `zipAFolderOptions` is falsy or when `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would execute when `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy and `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition that is always false, causing the code block to never execute, whereas the original code fragment would execute when `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy and `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream && true
```
