  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the latitude instead of the longitude, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude by adding 1 to it, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude by multiplying it by 2, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
