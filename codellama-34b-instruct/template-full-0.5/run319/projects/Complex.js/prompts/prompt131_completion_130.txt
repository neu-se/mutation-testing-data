  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original condition was `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the number is finite, which is the opposite of the original condition that checked if the number was infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the number is not a number, which is different from the original condition that checked if the number was infinite.

DONE.
