  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would return `undefined` for null values, which would result in a different string than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would add quotes around the number, which would result in a different string than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would use the first element of the object as the value to stringify, which would result in a different string than the original code.

DONE.
