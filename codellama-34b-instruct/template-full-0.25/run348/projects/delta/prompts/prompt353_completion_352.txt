  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined on the `inverted` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new `Delta` object with the specified range of ops, whereas the `chop` method mutates the existing `Delta` object by removing any trailing ops that have a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last op from the `ops` array, whereas the `chop` method removes any trailing ops that have a length of 0.

DONE.
