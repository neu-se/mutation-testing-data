 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments `end` and `data` are passed to the callback `cb` immediately, instead of waiting for the inner `read` function to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(null, [end, data])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.apply` is used to call the callback `cb`, potentially causing issues if the callback is relying on the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop(cb)(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop(cb)` is called with `end` and `data` as arguments, instead of directly calling `cb`. This would only be noticeable if `prop(cb)` has different behavior than `cb`.

DONE.
