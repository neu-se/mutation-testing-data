  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `Object.keys()` method is called on the `Promise` instance, it would return the keys of the `Promise` object itself, rather than the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `Object.keys()` method is called on the `Promise` instance, it would return `undefined`, rather than the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `Object.keys()` method is called on the `Promise` instance, it would return `null`, rather than the keys of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
