  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the key instead of a single key, which could cause the `get` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different key than the original code fragment, which could cause the `get` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string instead of a key, which could cause the `get` method to fail.

DONE.
