  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{head: null, tail: null}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new object with the properties "head" and "tail" set to the resolved value of the promise, while this replacement creates an object with the properties "head" and "tail" set to null. This will cause the tests to fail if they are expecting the object to have non-null properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{head: 0, tail: 0}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new object with the properties "head" and "tail" set to the resolved value of the promise, while this replacement creates an object with the properties "head" and "tail" set to 0. This will cause the tests to fail if they are expecting the object to have non-zero properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{head: Q.reject(new Error("error")), tail: null}
