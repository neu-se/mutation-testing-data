 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would have a different rejection reason, which is a newly created `Promise.reject` object instead of an `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
