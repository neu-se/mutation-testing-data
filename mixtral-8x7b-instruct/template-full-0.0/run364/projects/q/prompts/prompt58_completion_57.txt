 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'setImmediate' in window
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the `setImmediate` property in the `window` object, rather than checking if it is a function. This could lead to unexpected behavior in environments that do not have a global `setImmediate` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window.setImmediate === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if `setImmediate` is a function in the `window` object. However, this assumes that `setImmediate` is a property of the `window` object, which may not be the case in all environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof global.setImmediate === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `setImmediate` is a function in the `global` object. This is a more reliable way to check for
