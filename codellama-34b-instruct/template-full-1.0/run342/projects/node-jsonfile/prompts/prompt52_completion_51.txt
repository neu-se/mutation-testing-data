  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `JSON.stringify` function to throw an error, whereas the original code fragment would not do so.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `JSON.stringify` function to produce a different output than the original code fragment, which would lead to a different result when the `replace` method is called on the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, because the object `obj` is still being passed to the `JSON.stringify` function, and the `replace` method is still being called on the resulting string.

DONE.
