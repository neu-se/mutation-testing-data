  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null, function (reason) {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value, while this new code fragment rejects the promise with the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function (resolvedValue) {
    return resolvedValue + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value, while this new code fragment resolves the promise with the value plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function (resolvedValue) {
    return Q.reject(resolvedValue);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value, while this new code fragment rejects the promise with the same value.

DONE.
