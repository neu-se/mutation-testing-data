  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number in radians, while `Math.atan` returns the arctangent of a number in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number in radians, while `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number in radians, while `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a number in radians.

DONE.
