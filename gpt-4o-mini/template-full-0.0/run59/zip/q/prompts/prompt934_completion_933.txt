Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) and appends an additional argument (`1`) to the `args` array, potentially altering the function's execution and the arguments passed to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `this` with `null`, which may lead to unexpected behavior in methods that rely on the context of `this`, affecting how the function operates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `undefined` instead of `void 0` (though they are technically the same) and modifies the `args` array by removing the last element, which could change the expected arguments for the function being called.

DONE.
