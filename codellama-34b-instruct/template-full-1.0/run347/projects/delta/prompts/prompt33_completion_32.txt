  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, `base[key]` is checked to be `undefined`, but in this modified code, it is checked to be `null`. This means that if `base[key]` is `null`, the code will enter the `if` block and the `return` statement will be executed, which was not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, `base[key]` is checked to be `undefined`, but in this modified code, it is checked to be `NaN`. This means that if `base[key]` is `NaN`, the code will enter the `if` block and the `return` statement will be executed, which was not the case in the original code.
