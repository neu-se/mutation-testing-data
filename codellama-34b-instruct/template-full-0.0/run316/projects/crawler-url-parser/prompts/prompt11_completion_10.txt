  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, regardless of the case of the characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, regardless of the presence of line breaks.

DONE.
