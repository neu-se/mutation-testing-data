 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method might return a string representation of the object that includes unwanted characters, which would not be caught by the `_has_illegal_chars` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace `undefined` values with an empty string, which might not be caught by the `_has_illegal_chars` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr ?? ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) would replace `null` values with an empty string, which might not be caught by the `_has_illegal_chars` function.

DONE.
