Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call the callback if `end` is explicitly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or `0`, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to allow the callback to be called when `i` is equal to `max`, potentially allowing one more call than intended, which could lead to off-by-one errors in the logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call the callback if `end` is a negative number, which is likely not the intended use case, thus causing the function to behave incorrectly for positive values of `end`.

DONE.
