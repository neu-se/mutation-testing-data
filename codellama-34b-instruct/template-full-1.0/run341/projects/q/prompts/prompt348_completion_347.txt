  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the `done` variable to be truthy, indicating that the promise has already been resolved or rejected. If we return `false` instead, the promise will still be considered pending, and any code that depends on the promise will continue to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the `done` variable to be null, indicating that the promise has not been resolved or rejected. If we return `null` instead, the promise will still be considered pending, and any code that depends on the promise will continue to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the `done` variable to be defined, indicating that the promise has been resolved or rejected. If we return `void 0` instead, the promise will still
