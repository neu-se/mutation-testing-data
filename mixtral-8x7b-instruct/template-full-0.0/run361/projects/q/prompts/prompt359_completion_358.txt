 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback might receive `null` instead of the expected progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback might receive `undefined` instead of the expected progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback might receive `0` instead of the expected progress value, which could cause unintended behavior if the callback treats it as a numeric value.

DONE.
