 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * <bearing>
```
This would result in different behavior because it always multiplies the bearing by 1, which doesn't change the value but could introduce a redundant operation, and the test might not catch it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round(<bearing>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the bearing to the nearest integer, which could cause discrepancies in the calculated destination point if the original code requires precise decimal values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(<bearing>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always takes the absolute value of the bearing, effectively removing any negative signs. This could cause issues in the calculateDestination method, as it relies on the correct input of the bearing value.

DONE.
