 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array.prototype.slice method instead of the undefined `array_slice` function, which may have different behavior when called in the context of an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Function.prototype.slice method, which is not a standard method and is unlikely to have the same behavior as the intended `array_slice` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `arguments` object's `slice` method, which may have different behavior than the intended `array_slice` function when called with non-array objects.

DONE.
