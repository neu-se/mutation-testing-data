  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would always be called with a truthy value, even if the test failed, which could cause the test suite to pass when it should have failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would always be called with a falsey value, even if the test passed, which could cause the test suite to fail when it should have passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would always be called with a null value, which could cause the test suite to fail when it should have passed.

DONE.
