  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isNaN` and `isFinite` methods, causing the `isInfinite` method to always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']() || this['isZero']());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would also be checked, causing the `isInfinite` method to return `false` if the complex number is zero, even if it is not actually infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']() || this['im'] === 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property would be checked
