Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method of checking the length of the `line` Delta from a property access to a method call, which may not exist, leading to a runtime error instead of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the predicate to be called even when `line` is empty, which could lead to unintended processing of an empty Delta, potentially causing logical errors in the handling of lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the predicate call to only when there is exactly one operation in `line`, which may skip valid cases where `line` has more than one operation, leading to incomplete processing of the Delta.

DONE.
