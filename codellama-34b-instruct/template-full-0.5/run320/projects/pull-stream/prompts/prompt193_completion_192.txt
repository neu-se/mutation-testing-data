  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would always pass, even if the `aborted` variable was not set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would always fail, even if the `aborted` variable was set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would always pass, even if the `aborted` variable was set to `false`.

DONE.
