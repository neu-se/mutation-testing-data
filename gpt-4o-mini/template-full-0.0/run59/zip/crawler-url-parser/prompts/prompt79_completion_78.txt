Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a, img')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select both anchor (`<a>`) and image (`<img>`) elements, potentially leading to the extraction of URLs from images as well, which was not the original intent of only extracting from anchor tags.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').not('[target="_blank"]')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude any anchor tags that have a `target` attribute set to `_blank`, thus omitting certain links that might be relevant for extraction, unlike the original code which would include all anchor tags.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').filter(function() { return $(this).attr('href').includes('http'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only select anchor tags whose `href` attributes contain the string 'http', thereby ignoring any links that do not start with 'http', which could lead to missing valid URLs that do not conform to this pattern.

DONE.
